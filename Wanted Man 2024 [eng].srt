1
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,503
Asi me gusta baby.

2
00:00:36,535 --> 00:00:39,447
See? Makes all the
pretty girls smile.

3
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:40,568
Even the ugly ones.

4
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,912
But we leave them at home.

5
00:00:44,823 --> 00:00:46,743
- Todo bien Papi?
- Si.

6
00:00:46,775 --> 00:00:48,951
How can we argue with a
pretty smile?

7
00:00:48,983 --> 00:00:50,998
We got five full K's this time.

8
00:00:51,415 --> 00:00:52,822
90% pure.

9
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:56,799
Happy to trade.

10
00:00:59,031 --> 00:01:00,406
I love it when our

11
00:01:00,438 --> 00:01:02,679
two countries can come
together in unity.

12
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,374
Si.

13
00:01:05,623 --> 00:01:07,254
Right sweetheart?

14
00:01:07,286 --> 00:01:08,375
Claro que si.

15
00:01:08,695 --> 00:01:09,719
Salud.

16
00:01:09,751 --> 00:01:11,286
- Ha ha.
- To America.

17
00:01:11,318 --> 00:01:12,318
And Mexico.

18
00:01:12,534 --> 00:01:13,590
Viva.

19
00:01:13,621 --> 00:01:14,837
Salud.

20
00:01:23,094 --> 00:01:24,501
Woo!

21
00:01:26,006 --> 00:01:26,966
She's nice, right?

22
00:01:26,998 --> 00:01:28,502
Hmm.

23
00:01:28,534 --> 00:01:30,036
Woo.

24
00:01:30,068 --> 00:01:31,829
Me encanta Como bailas mi amor.

25
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,269
Yeah.

26
00:01:40,373 --> 00:01:41,524
Nice.

27
00:01:48,693 --> 00:01:50,451
- Shit.
- Don't move...

28
00:01:51,892 --> 00:01:53,428
...or die right here.

29
00:01:55,987 --> 00:01:57,268
Give him the case.

30
00:01:58,164 --> 00:01:59,164
Do it.

31
00:01:59,891 --> 00:02:01,651
Give him the fucking case.

32
00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:07,739
Eyes down.

33
00:02:08,884 --> 00:02:09,908
Hey, it's me.

34
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,218
Eyes down!

35
00:02:23,603 --> 00:02:24,754
No, no, no, it's me.

36
00:02:24,786 --> 00:02:26,099
It's me. It's Kahane.

37
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:27,762
No, no, no, we're DEA!

38
00:02:27,794 --> 00:02:29,331
We're DEA!

39
00:02:31,826 --> 00:02:32,850
No, no, no!

40
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,153
No!

41
00:02:43,474 --> 00:02:44,434
Jesus fucking Christ.

42
00:02:44,466 --> 00:02:45,714
What'd you do that for?

43
00:02:45,746 --> 00:02:47,282
He recognized me.

44
00:02:47,314 --> 00:02:48,721
We used to work together.

45
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:00,729
Let's go.

46
00:03:01,009 --> 00:03:02,128
Now!

47
00:03:06,417 --> 00:03:07,417
Shit.

48
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,567
Chief!

49
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,920
Come on!

50
00:04:12,749 --> 00:04:14,124
There were two of them.

51
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:20,908
Chief, we gotta go.

52
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,860
Let's blow this pop stand.

53
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:37,969
Agh.

54
00:06:19,143 --> 00:06:20,487
<i>For three days now</i>

55
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,951
<i>the crowd has remained here
at full strength.</i>

56
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,487
<i>Their agitation is apparent</i>

57
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:27,143
<i>but they have been remaining
peaceful for the most part.</i>

58
00:06:27,175 --> 00:06:28,967
<i>Their frustration and passion</i>

59
00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:31,814

60

81
00:07:28,068 --> 00:07:29,956
What do we want!
Justice!

82
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:34,851
That's him.

83
00:07:35,363 --> 00:07:36,419
That's him.

84
00:07:38,243 --> 00:07:39,243
Ugh.

85
00:08:00,162 --> 00:08:01,442
Yeah, once that..

86
00:08:01,474 --> 00:08:02,946
I'll call you back.

87
00:08:02,978 --> 00:08:03,978
Hey, Joe.

88
00:08:08,258 --> 00:08:09,250
Hey,

89
00:08:09,282 --> 00:08:10,657
don't pout big guy.

90
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:11,873
You look good.

91
00:08:11,905 --> 00:08:13,441
All dressed up for your big day?

92
00:08:13,953 --> 00:08:15,073
Hey come here.

93
00:08:15,521 --> 00:08:16,521
No.

94
00:08:16,961 --> 00:08:18,241
Come on, come here.

95
00:08:19,617 --> 00:08:20,769
I don't want a hug.

96
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:22,337
What? I'm not gonna
give you a hug.

97
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:23,809
What's wrong with you?

98
00:08:23,841 --> 00:08:25,473
Wait, do you need a hug?

99
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,921
I mean somebody here
probably knows how to.

100
00:08:26,945 --> 00:08:28,929
I'm sure I could find somebody.

101
00:08:28,961 --> 00:08:30,336
Thank you, yeah.

102
00:08:43,168 --> 00:08:44,168
Come in.

103
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:45,769
Sit down.

104
00:08:47,008 --> 00:08:49,472
Can't figure any of
this shit out.

105
00:08:49,504 --> 00:08:50,623
Sir.

106
00:08:51,263 --> 00:08:52,703
Ain't no job in the world

107
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:55,328
where having a bad day has
bigger repercussions,

108
00:08:55,359 --> 00:08:56,735
maybe an airline pilot.

109
00:08:57,183 --> 00:08:58,335
That's right.

110
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,519
Okay.

111
00:09:01,567 --> 00:09:02,687
Watch.

112
00:09:16,382 --> 00:09:19,486
<i>Joe! Hey, Joe, Joe, Joe, Hey!</i>

113
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:22,238
<i>No cameras.
Turn those off. Turn them..</i>

114
00:09:23,486 --> 00:09:25,214
Now for the good stuff.

115
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,134
<i>Joe, Joe.</i>

116
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,222
<i>Stay on the ground.</i>

117
00:09:28,254 --> 00:09:30,013
<i>Take it easy, man. Easy.</i>

118
00:09:30,045 --> 00:09:31,869
<i>Mexican lowlife.</i>

119
00:09:32,317 --> 00:09:33,373
There we go.

120
00:09:34,397 --> 00:09:35,773
That, was the headline.

121
00:09:35,805 --> 00:09:36,797
Mexican lowlife.

122
00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:38,589
Google it and your
face comes out.

123
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:41,309
They have these things
they call memes of you saying.

124
00:09:41,342 --> 00:09:43,326
'Mexican lowlife' over and over.

125
00:09:43,357 --> 00:09:45,182
Crazy what they can
do these days.

126
00:09:45,214 --> 00:09:47,134
Well he was an
illegal from Mexico.

127
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,893
He certainly was a lowlife
so technically..

128
00:09:48,925 --> 00:09:50,013
Johansen...

129
00:09:50,045 --> 00:09:51,164
shut it for a sec.

130
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,124
Your attitude is a
complete PR nightmare.

131
00:09:54,364 --> 00:09:56,196
I'm very sorry Sir but you have
the mayor's party

132
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,725
waiting for you in the
press room.

133
00:09:57,756 --> 00:09:59,452
Shit. All right thanks I'll
be right there.

134
00:09:59,484 --> 00:10:00,860
Maybe it'd be better if I didn't

135
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,652
go to the press
conference because..

136
00:10:02,684 --> 00:10:03,900
Yeah ha ha. Walk with me.

137
00:10:06,492 --> 00:10:07,900
Close my door on the way out.

138
00:10:09,404 --> 00:10:10,683
You do realize you're now the

139
00:10:10,715 --> 00:10:12,092
'Defund the police'
poster child?

140
00:10:12,124 --> 00:10:13,595
Jesus, Chief the fucking guy had

141
00:10:13,627 --> 00:10:15,579
a dozen traffic girls in the
back of that truck.

142
00:10:15,611 --> 00:10:16,675
Gave us chase for two miles.

143
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,291
How come no one mentions that
shit in the news?

144
00:10:19,963 --> 00:10:21,275
I get it. Trust me.

145
00:10:21,307 --> 00:10:23,451
That's why despite your
lovely behavior

146
00:10:23,483 --> 00:10:24,891
and the shit show of
a mob outside

147
00:10:24,923 --> 00:10:26,492
I'm recommending you for a job,

148
00:10:26,524 --> 00:10:28,507
a job that has 'good idea'
written all over it.

149
00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:31,386
- Job? Already got a..
- Not much longer.

150
00:10:31,418 --> 00:10:32,251
Look, listen to me.

151
00:10:32,283 --> 00:10:33,626
You'll not only lose your job

152
00:10:33,658 --> 00:10:36,987
you'll lose your pension and
you'll probably be prosecuted.

153
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:38,298
So do you want to hear this

154
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,811
or do you want to apply at
Walgreens across the street?

155
00:10:39,835 --> 00:10:42,330
Yes Sir. Ehem, I mean no Sir.

156
00:10:43,962 --> 00:10:45,402
How's the ankle?

157
00:10:45,434 --> 00:10:46,842
Uh, it's getting better.

158
00:10:46,874 --> 00:10:49,467
Having surgery, I'm taking
care of it thanks. Don't worry.

159
00:10:49,499 --> 00:10:50,649
Good.

160
00:10:50,681 --> 00:10:53,338
Now 87% of your
colleagues have already retired.

161
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,417
Normal humans do
that at your age in this job.

162
00:10:55,449 --> 00:10:57,465
You know you do a
thing for a while then you

163
00:10:57,497 --> 00:11:00,185
get on your horse and
you ride off into the sunset.

164
00:11:00,217 --> 00:11:01,657
So do you want to hear this?

165
00:11:01,689 --> 00:11:02,689
Yes, Sir.

166
00:11:03,417 --> 00:11:06,073
The DEA murders
in Silverado, remember that?

167
00:11:06,105 --> 00:11:08,921
Yeah, two undercover
agents killed in a drug buy.

168
00:11:09,401 --> 00:11:10,456
Real clusterfuck.

169
00:11:10,488 --> 00:11:12,696
Now the night they were killed
with those traffickers

170
00:11:12,728 --> 00:11:15,160
we found the body of
that working girl.

171
00:11:15,192 --> 00:11:16,760
Yeah, I remember one of...

172
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:18,712
Mason's girls at
Frisky's on the 135.

173
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:19,896
Yeah.

174
00:11:19,928 --> 00:11:22,584
Well he said he sent two other
hookers to that same party.

175
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:25,144
They weren't found
that night dead or alive.

176
00:11:25,176 --> 00:11:26,680
Yeah, I remember it

177
00:11:26,712 --> 00:11:27,801
two missing hookers.

178
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,304
Well, they just turned up.

179
00:11:29,817 --> 00:11:30,903
Mexico.

180
00:11:31,447 --> 00:11:32,919
Shoplifting arrest.

181
00:11:32,951 --> 00:11:34,775
We just got word from
the U.S. Attorney

182
00:11:34,807 --> 00:11:37,047
that we can bring
those ladies in for questioning.

183
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:39,607
They were either
involved or may know who was.

184
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:41,751
And I took some convincing

185
00:11:41,783 --> 00:11:43,095
but I got the marshals to agree

186
00:11:43,128 --> 00:11:44,855
to send you down to
represent them

187
00:11:44,887 --> 00:11:46,359
and represent us

188
00:11:46,391 --> 00:11:49,367
and bring those two witnesses
back here from Mexico ASAP.

189
00:11:53,783 --> 00:11:55,607
Uh, Mexico.

190
00:11:56,374 --> 00:11:57,494
Can I think about it?

191
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:00,342
Johansen,

192
00:12:00,374 --> 00:12:03,351
this isn't just
a good idea, it's the only idea.

193
00:12:03,383 --> 00:12:04,790
Let me spell it out for you

194
00:12:04,822 --> 00:12:07,574
you have to go
save yours and our reputation.

195
00:12:07,606 --> 00:12:08,310
Got it?

196
00:12:08,342 --> 00:12:10,549
Or... you're fucked.

197
00:12:19,798 --> 00:12:21,494
Chief, they're
waiting for us.

198
00:12:45,748 --> 00:12:48,020
My fellow Del Vista citizens

199
00:12:48,052 --> 00:12:52,308
it is with great humility
and respect for human dignity

200
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,483
that we have come here
today to address

201
00:12:54,515 --> 00:12:55,923
an unfortunate incident.

202
00:12:57,172 --> 00:12:59,219
Chief Hernandez will explain

203
00:12:59,251 --> 00:13:00,659
what went terribly wrong.

204
00:13:01,683 --> 00:13:03,059
Chief.

205
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:39,346
<i>Sergeant</i>
<i>Johansen</i>

206
00:13:39,378 --> 00:13:40,689
<i>made an inexcusable mistake</i>

207
00:13:40,721 --> 00:13:42,001
<i>and we're extremely sorry.</i>

208
00:13:42,033 --> 00:13:43,761
<i>He's been a cop for
over twenty years</i>

209
00:13:43,793 --> 00:13:45,297
<i>and he's come to realize that-</i>

210
00:13:45,329 --> 00:13:46,777
- Can you turn that off?
<i>- There's still things he</i>

211
00:13:46,801 --> 00:13:48,241
<i>has to learn about</i>

212
00:13:48,273 --> 00:13:49,201
<i>the Hispanic people</i>

213
00:13:49,233 --> 00:13:51,024
<i>and their beautiful culture.</i>

214
00:13:51,056 --> 00:13:52,144
<i>Any questions?</i>

215
00:13:55,952 --> 00:13:58,320
To the most wanted man of the
'Me Too' generation

216
00:13:58,353 --> 00:14:01,008
in California Police history.

217
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,696
Ha. And to that kiss-ass
job in Mexico.

218
00:14:05,105 --> 00:14:06,960
It's a damn publicity stunt.

219
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:09,041
Not a job.

220
00:14:09,073 --> 00:14:10,864
I tried to talk the
chief out of it.

221
00:14:10,896 --> 00:14:14,032
I figured you'd be better off on
vacation till the next asshole

222
00:14:14,063 --> 00:14:15,415
does something
politically incorrect,

223
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:17,520
and then you're just, you know,
old news.

224
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,656
He's already old news!

225
00:14:20,688 --> 00:14:23,280
Thank you Crystal.
That was lovely.

226
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,959
You should talk Brynner.
She's half your age.

227
00:14:30,991 --> 00:14:32,143
That girl?

228
00:14:32,175 --> 00:14:33,839
She makes twice my pension.

229
00:14:33,871 --> 00:14:34,959
Ha. Bet she does.

230
00:14:34,991 --> 00:14:38,286
So how many years did I
work for that asshole Hernandez?

231
00:14:38,318 --> 00:14:39,919
He never sent me to Mexico, huh?

232
00:14:39,951 --> 00:14:41,486
And I got all the shirts for it.

233
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,543
Big man.

234
00:14:42,575 --> 00:14:43,471
Yeah.

235
00:14:43,503 --> 00:14:45,838
Don't do it.
Just look at the boss and say:

236
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,726
'It's too dangerous to go to
Mexico.'

237
00:14:47,758 --> 00:14:49,167
Mostly because...

238
00:14:49,582 --> 00:14:50,510
What?

239
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,685
Loaded with Mexicans.

240
00:14:52,717 --> 00:14:55,278
- He's funny.
- He's right.

241
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,166
Look I just hate
assholes who just use

242
00:14:57,198 --> 00:14:59,373
our country as a doormat

243
00:14:59,405 --> 00:15:01,101
to wipe their dirty feet on.

244
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,413
That's bullshit.

245
00:15:02,445 --> 00:15:04,405
Yeah you know the second they
cross over that line

246
00:15:04,429 --> 00:15:04,846
they want a lawyer.

247
00:15:04,878 --> 00:15:06,157
They want some-

248
00:15:06,189 --> 00:15:08,181
they want a place to live, they
want some extra money.

249
00:15:08,205 --> 00:15:11,724
And they want a green card.
I'm sorry... asshole.

250
00:15:11,756 --> 00:15:13,325
You're illegal.
You don't get shit.

251
00:15:13,357 --> 00:15:16,109
Yeah that's right.
My dad came over from Sweden.

252
00:15:16,141 --> 00:15:17,804
The guy I worked his ass off.

253
00:15:17,836 --> 00:15:18,860
Was in the Marines

254
00:15:18,893 --> 00:15:22,061
bled for this country
didn't get anything for free

255
00:15:22,093 --> 00:15:23,949
and these people just
walk in here.

256
00:15:23,981 --> 00:15:24,941
They want it all

257
00:15:24,973 --> 00:15:27,020
just because they
crossed that line.

258
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:29,453
Think you're gonna hear
that on CNN, MSNBC?

259
00:15:29,485 --> 00:15:30,859
But even fucking Fox, man,

260
00:15:30,891 --> 00:15:32,620
they don't tell you the
real, not anymore.

261
00:15:32,652 --> 00:15:33,676
- Hey, I love Fox.
- Yeah.

262
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,883
Ha ha oh, boy. Used to be bad

263
00:15:35,915 --> 00:15:37,388
but now it's a fucking joke.

264
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,316
- That's right.
- Yeah.

265
00:15:38,348 --> 00:15:40,523
The whole fucking
thing is a joke.

266
00:15:41,451 --> 00:15:42,988
I agree, so

267
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,124
take it as the big hint
you know? Get out of dodge.

268
00:15:46,156 --> 00:15:47,563
Retire, brother.

269
00:15:47,595 --> 00:15:50,859
- And don't go to Mexico.
- Yeah, yeah.

270
00:15:50,891 --> 00:15:52,234
Listen to Hilts.

271
00:15:52,266 --> 00:15:55,210
Walk in there and tell Hernandez
to shove this job up his ass

272
00:15:55,242 --> 00:15:58,539
and throw that badge on the desk
just like Dirty fucking Harry.

273
00:15:58,571 --> 00:16:00,395
Come down, spend time
with your friends.

274
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:02,091
Get a twenty year old
on your lap.

275
00:16:02,123 --> 00:16:03,339
There you go.

276
00:16:03,371 --> 00:16:04,658
You weren't much better
at conversation

277
00:16:04,682 --> 00:16:06,059
when we rode together Brynner.

278
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:09,546
I appreciate the pep talk boys
but I'm heading south tomorrow

279
00:16:09,578 --> 00:16:11,850
so get me a drink or a stripper

280
00:16:11,882 --> 00:16:13,513
- or something so I can...
- Yo!

281
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:15,057
Robbery.

282
00:16:15,369 --> 00:16:16,554
Hands up.

283
00:16:16,586 --> 00:16:17,546
I'm sorry, ladies

284
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:19,145
bingo is three doors down.

285
00:16:19,177 --> 00:16:20,714
I just spent some time
with your mother

286
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,346
in the broom closet down there.

287
00:16:22,378 --> 00:16:24,073
She's still decomposing?

288
00:16:24,106 --> 00:16:25,106
That is hot.

289
00:16:25,514 --> 00:16:26,474
That's hot.

290
00:16:26,506 --> 00:16:28,362
That's my future ex-wife.

291
00:16:28,394 --> 00:16:29,930
Oh, she never heard that before.

292
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:31,273
Oh, come on.

293
00:16:31,305 --> 00:16:33,033
-What, is it is it me or are
these girls..

294
00:16:33,065 --> 00:16:34,440
Getting younger and younger?

295
00:16:34,472 --> 00:16:37,384
No, no. That's just you getting
older and older, Tinelli.

296
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:40,200
- That's right.
- I can live with that.

297
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:43,721
Hey, Johansen you
looked good on TV this morning.

298
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:46,920
Oh, really?
Well, thanks, psycho.

299
00:16:46,952 --> 00:16:48,872
Where did you get that hat?

300
00:16:48,904 --> 00:16:51,847
We got to find another place to
hang out, strip clubs are so...

301
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:53,543
I don't know, they're so 80s.

302
00:16:53,575 --> 00:16:54,856
I like the 80s.

303
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,232
80s are okay with me.

304
00:16:56,264 --> 00:16:57,672
Hey, I need another shot.

305
00:16:57,704 --> 00:16:58,599
- Go.
- You want?

306
00:16:58,632 --> 00:17:00,552
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Something brown.

307
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:02,311
Let me drive you home,
all right?

308
00:17:02,343 --> 00:17:03,975
You sure you want to go
tomorrow?

309
00:17:04,007 --> 00:17:05,031
- Yeah.
- Easy.

310
00:17:05,063 --> 00:17:06,600
I drive better drunk than you
do sober.

311
00:17:06,632 --> 00:17:09,767
- Oh, come on. Please.
- Yeah, that's right. I'm fine.

312
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:11,814
- I'm great.
- All right.

313
00:17:11,846 --> 00:17:14,790
All right buddy,
see you when I'm back stateside.

314
00:17:14,822 --> 00:17:18,343
Hey, you're a work
in progress, you know that?

315
00:17:18,374 --> 00:17:20,454
- All right, yeah.
- Take it easy down there.

316
00:17:20,486 --> 00:17:22,631
Yeah yeah. I'll have a few
tequila shots.

317
00:17:22,663 --> 00:17:23,655
Ha ha. All right.

318
00:17:23,687 --> 00:17:24,935
- On you.
- Yeah.

319
00:17:25,927 --> 00:17:28,326
Hey, what the hell?

320
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,479
Take it easy.

321
00:17:29,511 --> 00:17:31,366
- Take it easy.
- Hey. Hey.

322
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,950
I'm sorry, señor.

323
00:17:41,382 --> 00:17:42,693
Señor?

324
00:17:42,725 --> 00:17:43,878
You're sorry?

325
00:17:44,485 --> 00:17:45,605
You got a license?

326
00:17:45,638 --> 00:17:47,750
- Yes, of course.
- How about a green card?

327
00:17:48,518 --> 00:17:50,533
Actually, I was born in Arizona.

328
00:17:51,813 --> 00:17:53,124
Have I seen you before?

329
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:54,789
Yeah, maybe so.

330
00:17:54,821 --> 00:17:57,924
Joe, it's okay man let it go.
It was an accident, all right?

331
00:17:57,956 --> 00:17:59,397
Sir, I'm going to go into my car

332
00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:01,860
get my license and registration
okay? Just give me a minute.

333
00:18:01,892 --> 00:18:04,740
Hey, you know what you are?

334
00:18:05,093 --> 00:18:06,093
You're...

335
00:18:10,564 --> 00:18:12,548
It's a damn scratch, anyway.

336
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,115
- Ha.
- Yeah.

337
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,187
Forget it.

338
00:18:17,219 --> 00:18:19,139
All right, all right.

339
00:18:19,684 --> 00:18:20,771
I'm sorry, Sir.

340
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:13,193
Ugh.

341
00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:19,937
Hey, amigo,

342
00:19:19,969 --> 00:19:22,593
you'll take good
care of that Smith & Wesson.

343
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,344
It's an expensive
American piece of art.

344
00:19:25,377 --> 00:19:28,160
And we will cherish her forever.

345
00:19:28,192 --> 00:19:31,136
Don't worry. We'll give it
back to you oiled and polished.

346
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,959
Officer De La Cruz.

347
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,783
Mexican Federal Police.

348
00:19:34,815 --> 00:19:37,856
Liaison to the
wonderful world of extraditions.

349
00:19:37,888 --> 00:19:41,792
Personally I prefer
this .45 caliber Jericho 941

350
00:19:41,824 --> 00:19:42,752
made in Israel.

351
00:19:42,784 --> 00:19:44,800
We can pick our own on
weapons here.

352
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:48,384
Johansen.

353
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,399
Detective Sergeant.

354
00:19:50,431 --> 00:19:52,543
So you're the Great White Whale.

355
00:19:53,343 --> 00:19:54,335
Excuse me?

356
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:55,367
Gran Ballena Blanca.

357
00:19:56,159 --> 00:19:57,183
Moby Dick.

358
00:19:58,367 --> 00:20:00,648
News down here likes to give
personalities, special names.

359
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,446
Your English is pretty good.

360
00:20:04,478 --> 00:20:06,398
My Italian is even better.

361
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,967
Four years, San Diego State.

362
00:20:09,215 --> 00:20:10,750
It's a 3180.

363
00:20:12,606 --> 00:20:14,494
Sign here and here.

364
00:20:16,254 --> 00:20:18,622
The U.S. Marshal
signed already this morning.

365
00:20:19,805 --> 00:20:22,046
They meet us on your
way back to the border.

366
00:20:23,102 --> 00:20:24,102
Wait.

367
00:20:25,022 --> 00:20:27,070
I thought I was
supposed to pick 'em up here.

368
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:28,414
Andale.

369
00:20:28,445 --> 00:20:30,813
- Detective.
- I can't believe this.

370
00:20:33,885 --> 00:20:36,477
Regarding the DEA murder victims
in that drug shootout,

371
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:37,565
the U.S. attorney

372
00:20:37,597 --> 00:20:39,964
just cleared the red tape with
the victims' families.

373
00:20:39,996 --> 00:20:42,237
No death penalty in case of
prosecution for either

374
00:20:42,269 --> 00:20:44,413
so all governments are happy.

375
00:20:44,445 --> 00:20:45,981
We can now saddle up, cowboy,

376
00:20:46,013 --> 00:20:47,804
and go get your witnesses

377
00:20:47,837 --> 00:20:49,980
our two lovely travel
companions.

378
00:20:50,012 --> 00:20:51,068
How long?

379
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,443
Three hours.

380
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,940
Ugh.

381
00:21:05,628 --> 00:21:08,795
One day I'd like to
get involved with the DEA.

382
00:21:08,827 --> 00:21:09,787
Put in my time here

383
00:21:09,819 --> 00:21:11,099
maybe a couple more years

384
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:13,019
and put in for a transfer.

385
00:21:13,051 --> 00:21:15,707
I've already studied in the
States on a temporary visa

386
00:21:15,739 --> 00:21:17,947
for four years so should
be pretty easy.

387
00:21:18,683 --> 00:21:19,683
Uh-huh.

388
00:21:20,731 --> 00:21:23,131
You know those drugs
flow both ways.

389
00:21:23,162 --> 00:21:25,691
It's true, they don't all come
from here.

390
00:21:25,723 --> 00:21:28,539
But I admit it gets
pretty bad at the border.

391
00:21:29,945 --> 00:21:31,194
Los coyotes make it bad.

392
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:43,610
We're stopping here?

393
00:21:43,642 --> 00:21:44,642
Exactly.

394
00:21:45,466 --> 00:21:46,754
Don't worry. We make it nice
and easy for you.

395
00:21:46,778 --> 00:21:48,474
Quick in, quick out.

396
00:21:48,506 --> 00:21:51,449
Get you home to your
beautiful strippers and beer.

397
00:21:53,753 --> 00:21:55,065
I'm fucking with you.

398
00:21:55,097 --> 00:21:57,913
I know it's a stereotype
about you American cops.

399
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:37,815
Detective Sergeant.

400
00:22:37,847 --> 00:22:39,223
Mr. Gran Ballena.

401
00:22:39,255 --> 00:22:40,535
Come meet our witnesses,

402
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,039
Leticia Gomez

403
00:22:42,071 --> 00:22:43,991
and Señorita Rosa Barranco.

404
00:22:44,023 --> 00:22:46,487
Someone tried to kill
her last week.

405
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:48,087
¿Nos van a entregar con este
güero?

406
00:22:48,983 --> 00:22:49,590
¿Que no lo ves?

407
00:22:49,623 --> 00:22:50,645
¿Que no entiendes?

408
00:22:50,678 --> 00:22:52,694
What the hell is this one
yelling about?

409
00:22:52,726 --> 00:22:55,542
She says we might as well kill
her now and be done with it.

410
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:58,870
Okay, I'll think about it. Let's
get back stateside first.

411
00:22:58,902 --> 00:23:00,086
Into the car.

412
00:23:00,117 --> 00:23:02,134
Mira si nos encuentran muertos
va a ser tu culpa.

413
00:23:02,165 --> 00:23:05,014
¡Pinche cerdo! Me las vas a
pagar pendejo.

414
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,854
¿Que no se das cuenta?

415
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:14,037
Ugh.

416
00:23:15,765 --> 00:23:17,524
Esto no
puede ser pasando.

417
00:23:17,557 --> 00:23:19,381
Rosa nos van a encontrar muert..

418
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:27,029
Yeah that's right.
Gomez and Barranco.

419
00:23:27,061 --> 00:23:29,141
Got the witnesses right here.

420
00:23:29,173 --> 00:23:31,732
We'll be in
San Diego in a couple of hours.

421
00:23:31,764 --> 00:23:32,788
All right, boss.

422
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,580
Porque no le cuentas a
tu jefe tambien

423
00:23:34,612 --> 00:23:36,916
que en dos horas
nos van a encontrar muertas.

424
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:38,612
- What?
- Tu eres el maton?

425
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,876
Pinche gato.

426
00:23:41,908 --> 00:23:43,412
Yeah, yeah.

427
00:23:43,443 --> 00:23:44,724
Shut the fuck up.

428
00:23:45,204 --> 00:23:46,484
I'm tired.

429
00:23:52,883 --> 00:23:54,099
So I was trying to decide

430
00:23:54,131 --> 00:23:56,083
between a cop or a firefighter

431
00:23:56,115 --> 00:23:58,963
but I ended up
as a Federali at the border.

432
00:23:59,603 --> 00:24:00,819
My English and all.

433
00:24:01,779 --> 00:24:04,467
Make more of a
difference that way, you know?

434
00:24:04,499 --> 00:24:07,603
And I might try acting if I
ever go to Hollywood.

435
00:24:07,635 --> 00:24:10,354
Sometimes I mess around with
movie lines.

436
00:24:12,146 --> 00:24:13,298
You looking at me?

437
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:15,186
There's nobody else around here.

438
00:24:15,826 --> 00:24:16,826
Or...

439
00:24:17,266 --> 00:24:19,026
Say hello to my little friend.

440
00:24:19,794 --> 00:24:21,042
That's Pacino.

441
00:24:21,074 --> 00:24:22,898
Mhmm.

442
00:24:44,689 --> 00:24:45,937
With my real police skills

443
00:24:45,969 --> 00:24:47,857
plus being bilingual and all,

444
00:24:47,889 --> 00:24:49,873
I think I got a
pretty good shot.

445
00:24:55,408 --> 00:24:57,296
¿Algún problema?

446
00:24:57,328 --> 00:25:00,208
- ¡Hazte a un lado!
- Soy oficial federal.

447
00:25:04,784 --> 00:25:06,544
Get down!

448
00:25:50,989 --> 00:25:52,333
What the fuck is going on?

449
00:25:54,989 --> 00:25:57,325
No, freeze! Drop the weapon!

450
00:26:02,509 --> 00:26:03,661
Leti.

451
00:26:05,101 --> 00:26:06,413
Leti!

452
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:08,685
Leti!

453
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:14,028
Chief, I need help down here.

454
00:26:14,476 --> 00:26:15,917
We were ambushed

455
00:26:15,948 --> 00:26:18,444
by two shooters
dressed as police officers.

456
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:20,140
Yeah, I'm okay.

457
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:22,924
No, they're dead.

458
00:26:23,501 --> 00:26:25,740
Leti!

459
00:26:25,772 --> 00:26:27,884
I need back up.
Right this..

460
00:26:27,916 --> 00:26:29,237
<i>OK, OK.</i>
<i>Tell me where you are.</i>

461
00:26:29,261 --> 00:26:30,323
<i>I'll find out if I can
send anybody.</i>

462
00:26:30,347 --> 00:26:31,627
Shit.

463
00:26:31,659 --> 00:26:32,659
I've been hit.

464
00:26:33,196 --> 00:26:34,379
I'll call you back.

465
00:26:34,411 --> 00:26:36,683
Ayudame por favor.

466
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:44,747
Leti! Leti! Ayudame!

467
00:26:49,579 --> 00:26:50,858
Leti!

468
00:26:56,874 --> 00:26:58,027
She Dead?

469
00:26:58,059 --> 00:26:59,466
Muerta?

470
00:26:59,498 --> 00:27:01,035
Yes, muerte.

471
00:27:01,066 --> 00:27:02,122
She's dead.

472
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:03,658
She never wanted any of this.

473
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:06,218
Okay, we need to find
something to bandage my wound.

474
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,715
I knew they were going to kill
us for what we saw.

475
00:27:08,746 --> 00:27:09,802
They killed my friend.

476
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:11,849
My friend Leti!

477
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:15,625
I need you to
go to that vehicle over there.

478
00:27:15,657 --> 00:27:17,545
Look for a first aid kit.

479
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:21,352
First aid kit.

480
00:27:28,072 --> 00:27:30,056
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait.

481
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,104
No. What are you doing?

482
00:27:37,224 --> 00:27:38,568
Ahh shit.

483
00:27:41,992 --> 00:27:43,528
Come back. Wait.

484
00:27:43,944 --> 00:27:45,129
Ugh.

485
00:27:45,161 --> 00:27:46,248
Wait.

486
00:27:49,992 --> 00:27:51,079
Come back.

487
00:27:53,479 --> 00:27:54,479
Ahh.

488
00:27:56,199 --> 00:27:57,255
Come back.

489
00:28:00,103 --> 00:28:01,543
Come back.

490
00:28:11,718 --> 00:28:13,767
That's what
you're looking for?

491
00:28:20,294 --> 00:28:21,990
Ahh. Easy.

492
00:28:22,662 --> 00:28:24,102
Use that big one.

493
00:28:24,134 --> 00:28:24,934
Stop the bleeding.

494
00:28:24,966 --> 00:28:26,566
Okay, okay. I don't know you.

495
00:28:26,598 --> 00:28:28,774
I don't give a fuck about you.

496
00:28:28,806 --> 00:28:31,428
They'll be here soon and
I won't be here.

497
00:28:33,094 --> 00:28:34,150
Those...

498
00:28:34,181 --> 00:28:35,525
were...

499
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:37,413
...real cops?

500
00:28:38,117 --> 00:28:40,037
Mexico's finest.

501
00:28:40,068 --> 00:28:42,053
We need to get out of here.

502
00:28:43,429 --> 00:28:44,389
Hospital.

503
00:28:44,421 --> 00:28:46,853
No, no, no, no.
That's not where you want to go.

504
00:28:47,748 --> 00:28:50,276
Look I know a place but...

505
00:28:51,716 --> 00:28:53,253
Ahh.

506
00:28:53,285 --> 00:28:55,588
Hey, hey, hey no more of
your fucking calls.

507
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:59,077
Someone knew that we were here
when you called everyone.

508
00:28:59,109 --> 00:29:00,997
Now they're going
to know that we're still alive

509
00:29:01,029 --> 00:29:03,236
so no more of your fucking
calls, entiendes?

510
00:29:05,765 --> 00:29:07,907
Siempre con el pinche teléfono.

511
00:30:16,833 --> 00:30:17,920
Uh.

512
00:30:21,345 --> 00:30:22,688
Who are you?

513
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,481
What happened?

514
00:30:24,513 --> 00:30:26,048
Where's that hooker?

515
00:30:27,904 --> 00:30:28,928
I mean...

516
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,527
woman.

517
00:30:31,232 --> 00:30:32,735
Hey, qué pasa?

518
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,343
Hey, what's going on?

519
00:30:44,416 --> 00:30:46,239
Hey, I'm talking to you.

520
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,839
Habla inglés?

521
00:30:47,871 --> 00:30:49,727
Ah, shit.

522
00:30:52,223 --> 00:30:53,311
Don't worry.

523
00:30:53,343 --> 00:30:54,879
You still have all your organs.

524
00:30:55,199 --> 00:30:56,318
You.

525
00:30:57,214 --> 00:30:58,622
What the hell happened?

526
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:01,470
This is my brother.

527
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:05,182
He's not one of the ones who
tried to kill you.

528
00:31:05,214 --> 00:31:08,190
Like I said those were
real police yesterday in name.

529
00:31:08,222 --> 00:31:09,694
But just because you
wear the badge

530
00:31:09,726 --> 00:31:11,901
doesn't mean you
always live by it.

531
00:31:11,933 --> 00:31:13,981
I believe they're
trying to kill you.

532
00:31:16,286 --> 00:31:18,589
This is called kidnapping.

533
00:31:18,621 --> 00:31:20,317
Necesita descansar.

534
00:31:20,349 --> 00:31:23,070
Ya cuando se
recupere veo que hacer con el.

535
00:31:23,102 --> 00:31:24,509
He said you need to rest.

536
00:31:24,541 --> 00:31:27,486
Then later we'll talk
about what we do with you.

537
00:31:28,381 --> 00:31:29,381
Where's my phone?

538
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:30,653
I need that.

539
00:31:30,685 --> 00:31:32,924
I used it to get
you off the road yesterday

540
00:31:32,956 --> 00:31:34,052
where your red white
and blue blood

541
00:31:34,076 --> 00:31:36,541
was flowing down the pavement...

542
00:31:36,572 --> 00:31:38,109
and then I smashed it to pieces.

543
00:31:40,253 --> 00:31:41,341
Just relax.

544
00:31:41,372 --> 00:31:43,676
We had a doctor fix you
up the right way.

545
00:31:43,708 --> 00:31:47,452
He said the bullet's out but you
gotta rest at least a week.

546
00:31:47,484 --> 00:31:50,395
Thanks, but a week? No way.

547
00:31:50,427 --> 00:31:52,891
People from the States
are gonna wonder where I am.

548
00:31:52,923 --> 00:31:54,075
You gotta let me go.

549
00:31:54,107 --> 00:31:56,572
No lo puedo tener
aqui mucho lo van a encontrar.

550
00:31:56,604 --> 00:31:57,851
Where's my gun?

551
00:31:57,883 --> 00:31:59,611
- I need that.
- Hey!

552
00:31:59,643 --> 00:32:01,691
Necesitas. Descansar.

553
00:32:02,523 --> 00:32:03,964
You need to rest.

554
00:32:05,084 --> 00:32:06,268
Wait.

555
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,675
Hey. Agh.

556
00:32:30,234 --> 00:32:31,705
Hey...

557
00:32:34,169 --> 00:32:35,930
get me out of these cuffs.

558
00:32:35,962 --> 00:32:38,105
There's 500 bucks in it for you.

559
00:32:43,706 --> 00:32:44,825
A thousand?

560
00:32:46,873 --> 00:32:48,025
Hey...

561
00:32:51,897 --> 00:32:52,985
talking to you.

562
00:32:57,944 --> 00:32:59,192
Comida?

563
00:33:02,585 --> 00:33:03,641
Okay.

564
00:33:04,377 --> 00:33:05,377
Yeah.

565
00:33:14,487 --> 00:33:16,024
Change of the guard, huh?

566
00:33:34,615 --> 00:33:35,926
Mhmm.

567
00:33:36,854 --> 00:33:37,910
Gracias.

568
00:33:38,935 --> 00:33:39,935
Bueno.

569
00:33:44,246 --> 00:33:45,655
It's good prison food.

570
00:33:53,141 --> 00:33:55,029
Hey, how you doing?
Hello.

571
00:33:55,061 --> 00:33:56,406
Good to see you, boys.

572
00:33:56,438 --> 00:33:57,206
Jimmy.

573
00:33:57,238 --> 00:33:59,222
How you been, man?
Lose some weight?

574
00:33:59,254 --> 00:34:00,565
You look good.

575
00:34:02,902 --> 00:34:03,701
What?

576
00:34:03,733 --> 00:34:05,206
You missing your old life?

577
00:34:05,238 --> 00:34:06,517
No.

578
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:08,309
I miss my young life.

579
00:34:09,142 --> 00:34:10,581
- Asshole.
- Ha ha.

580
00:34:10,613 --> 00:34:11,637
What's happening?

581
00:34:12,885 --> 00:34:14,813
The news is going nuts on all
this now, Joe's getting famous.

582
00:34:14,837 --> 00:34:16,980
- Yeah.
- Killing some Mexican cops.

583
00:34:17,011 --> 00:34:18,389
On the run with a witness.

584
00:34:19,253 --> 00:34:20,629
One hell of a story.

585
00:34:20,661 --> 00:34:21,780
Yeah.

586
00:34:23,957 --> 00:34:25,949
I'll call you back.

587
00:34:25,973 --> 00:34:26,973
Brynner.

588
00:34:29,813 --> 00:34:31,124
Okay look,

589
00:34:31,156 --> 00:34:32,564
I know you're all
old friends but

590
00:34:32,596 --> 00:34:34,868
I can't start talking out of
the office right now.

591
00:34:34,899 --> 00:34:37,460
This turned into obviously the
worst move of my career.

592
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:41,236
Just a concerned
civilian now, Chief. Come on.

593
00:34:41,267 --> 00:34:43,476
And I appreciate your concern.

594
00:34:43,508 --> 00:34:46,004
But right now I have to keep
this clean and contained.

595
00:34:46,867 --> 00:34:48,308
You hear back from him yet?

596
00:34:51,283 --> 00:34:52,827
I can tell you that I've
been on the phone

597
00:34:52,851 --> 00:34:54,482
ad nauseam with state and feds.

598
00:34:54,514 --> 00:34:56,595
They're picking this up.
We will find him.

599
00:34:56,626 --> 00:34:59,506
I'm sure there's an explanation
for this clusterfuck.

600
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:03,571
Well, I'm glad you're enjoying
your tour of the office

601
00:35:03,603 --> 00:35:05,203
but is there something...

602
00:35:05,235 --> 00:35:06,226
This job...

603
00:35:06,259 --> 00:35:07,707
It's just a little tougher
to step away from

604
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:09,395
than you think it's going to be.

605
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:13,074
I'd like to get back into
the thick of it.

606
00:35:13,617 --> 00:35:14,898
Do some good again.

607
00:35:16,274 --> 00:35:17,650
I'm sure.

608
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:22,002
I'll let you know
if I can use your help Brynner.

609
00:35:22,034 --> 00:35:24,177
But right now just go
back to your life

610
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:25,586
and I'll keep you posted.

611
00:35:26,128 --> 00:35:27,282
As for you, Hilts,

612
00:35:27,314 --> 00:35:29,265
I need you on the Woolsey
Street shooting.

613
00:35:29,298 --> 00:35:30,800
Sir, Kamstock's got
that covered.

614
00:35:30,832 --> 00:35:32,720
I want you focused on it.

615
00:35:33,904 --> 00:35:35,984
Don't sweat it, guys.

616
00:35:36,017 --> 00:35:36,944
He's a strong one.

617
00:35:36,977 --> 00:35:39,536
This may look as shitty
as it gets but

618
00:35:39,567 --> 00:35:41,392
Johansen has a few lives left.

619
00:35:41,424 --> 00:35:42,512
I know it.

620
00:35:46,481 --> 00:35:47,481
Ugh.

621
00:35:48,497 --> 00:35:49,617
Uh.

622
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:51,183
Thanks Wolfman.

623
00:36:09,326 --> 00:36:11,535
Mama te va a traer
comida en la mañana.

624
00:36:12,623 --> 00:36:13,623
Food.

625
00:36:15,183 --> 00:36:16,399
Gracias.

626
00:36:38,124 --> 00:36:40,909
Aqui tengo su medicina.

627
00:36:40,941 --> 00:36:43,789
Bueno mija no
te quedes mucho tiempo con el.

628
00:36:53,677 --> 00:36:54,677
Here.

629
00:36:55,276 --> 00:36:56,749
It's okay, I don't need them.

630
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:57,781
Take it.

631
00:37:01,996 --> 00:37:04,717
So, whoever came after
you yesterday,

632
00:37:04,749 --> 00:37:05,749
us,

633
00:37:06,669 --> 00:37:08,843
had enough money
to pay off local police.

634
00:37:08,876 --> 00:37:11,756
That means cartel, traficantes.

635
00:37:11,788 --> 00:37:13,708
Alright well let me make
one phone call

636
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,788
and I'll bring some help
from the U.S. down here.

637
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:18,508
Don't worry about it
your family's going to be fine.

638
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,460
You get me out of these
cuffs all right?

639
00:37:20,492 --> 00:37:21,772
I don't have the key.

640
00:37:22,732 --> 00:37:23,916
Ahh.

641
00:37:23,948 --> 00:37:25,292
That's bullshit.

642
00:37:26,379 --> 00:37:28,299
I won't be coming back with you.

643
00:37:29,002 --> 00:37:30,570
I just want you to know.

644
00:37:30,603 --> 00:37:32,651
You are, like it or not.

645
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:34,666
You don't get it, do you?

646
00:37:34,698 --> 00:37:37,259
Who do you think is
trying to kill us?

647
00:37:40,843 --> 00:37:44,459
Kill you, you mean. You clearly
know how to piss people off.

648
00:37:45,099 --> 00:37:46,443
Well like it or not,

649
00:37:46,475 --> 00:37:49,130
they're now trying to kill you
too if you haven't noticed.

650
00:37:49,162 --> 00:37:51,498
I saw what happened
that night and they know it.

651
00:37:52,969 --> 00:37:55,018
The night of the DEA murders.

652
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:58,729
All right, so you saw some

653
00:37:58,761 --> 00:38:01,641
cartel guys that now want
you dead, too.

654
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:03,090
Not cartel.

655
00:38:03,882 --> 00:38:04,970
They were cops.

656
00:38:05,481 --> 00:38:07,401
American cops.

657
00:38:08,617 --> 00:38:10,536
I'm sorry, but coming from
someone who hands up

658
00:38:10,569 --> 00:38:14,281
blowjobs for a living that's a
tough one to swallow.

659
00:38:14,889 --> 00:38:16,296
No pun intended.

660
00:38:17,193 --> 00:38:18,193
Fuck you.

661
00:38:19,113 --> 00:38:20,169
Hey.

662
00:38:20,201 --> 00:38:21,289
Hey wait I'm sorry.

663
00:38:22,121 --> 00:38:23,121
I'm sorry.

664
00:38:25,129 --> 00:38:27,753
So what did you see that makes
you think they were...

665
00:38:29,352 --> 00:38:30,504
American police?

666
00:38:32,615 --> 00:38:33,736
I heard them.

667
00:38:36,071 --> 00:38:37,544
The masked men

668
00:38:37,576 --> 00:38:39,208
recognized the DEA agent.

669
00:38:40,392 --> 00:38:42,056
<i>Eyes down.</i>

670
00:38:42,823 --> 00:38:44,072
<i>Eyes down.</i>

671
00:38:44,104 --> 00:38:46,856
<i>It's me, it's Kahane.
We're DEA. We're DEA!</i>

672
00:38:46,888 --> 00:38:48,200
And then they shot him.

673
00:38:54,887 --> 00:38:56,230
<i>Jesus Fucking Christ.</i>

674
00:38:56,262 --> 00:38:58,278
<i>- What did you do that for?
- He recognized me.</i>

675
00:38:58,311 --> 00:39:00,039
<i>We used to work together.</i>

676
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:01,447
He said they worked together.

677
00:39:02,279 --> 00:39:03,279
So,

678
00:39:04,167 --> 00:39:06,887
if they were cops
then who's after you, us?

679
00:39:06,918 --> 00:39:08,615
Well we got picked up
for shoplifting

680
00:39:08,647 --> 00:39:12,038
so, someone must have tipped off
the cartel where to find us.

681
00:39:13,446 --> 00:39:14,342
Okay,

682
00:39:14,374 --> 00:39:15,470
well somehow I'll deal with it

683
00:39:15,494 --> 00:39:17,990
but just let me make
a phone call.

684
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,206
It's dangerous.

685
00:39:19,238 --> 00:39:22,790
The longer we're here the more
danger for your family, for you.

686
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:24,430
Everyone.

687
00:39:25,094 --> 00:39:26,373
I'll think about it.

688
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:30,916
Trust me, I was far from
interested in coming back here.

689
00:39:31,876 --> 00:39:33,796
This is my cousin
Salvador's place.

690
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:35,653
I can't even go back to
my own village.

691
00:39:35,685 --> 00:39:37,477
They'd be looking for me there.

692
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,789
Why come back?

693
00:39:40,037 --> 00:39:43,301
I guess I could have left you on
the side of the road to die.

694
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:44,869
Well it's a tough
choice between that

695
00:39:44,901 --> 00:39:48,357
and being chained up
watching Spanish novelas.

696
00:40:12,227 --> 00:40:13,475
See, I told you...

697
00:40:14,883 --> 00:40:16,290
bad husband.

698
00:40:17,379 --> 00:40:18,595
No buen hombre.

699
00:40:18,627 --> 00:40:20,739
Dices bien, es muy mal hombre.

700
00:40:21,027 --> 00:40:22,083
Mhm.

701
00:40:22,115 --> 00:40:23,115
Mama.

702
00:40:23,619 --> 00:40:24,707
Cómo te sientes?

703
00:40:24,739 --> 00:40:26,531
Estoy muy cansada, mija.

704
00:40:26,915 --> 00:40:27,875
Descanse.

705
00:40:27,907 --> 00:40:28,907
Okay.

706
00:40:39,426 --> 00:40:41,186
If I go back with you...

707
00:40:42,818 --> 00:40:44,642
will they really protect me?

708
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:46,914
You want me to bring
you back to the States?

709
00:40:46,946 --> 00:40:47,778
Yes,

710
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:49,506
but keep your voice down.

711
00:40:49,538 --> 00:40:50,785
Okay, yeah.

712
00:40:51,681 --> 00:40:53,281
Witness protection is
a real thing

713
00:40:53,314 --> 00:40:55,553
but you have to have
information they want.

714
00:40:55,585 --> 00:40:56,481
I do.

715
00:40:56,513 --> 00:40:58,625
Okay, get me out of
these cuffs and...

716
00:40:58,657 --> 00:40:59,937
I'll take you back.

717
00:40:59,969 --> 00:41:01,089
It's not up to me.

718
00:41:01,922 --> 00:41:02,977
Who is it up to?

719
00:41:03,009 --> 00:41:04,161
My brother.

720
00:41:13,312 --> 00:41:15,488
Call someone to come pick us up.

721
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,288
Miguel's not gonna like this.

722
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,272
He'll like us dead even less.

723
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:31,391
Chief,
it's Johansen.

724
00:41:31,423 --> 00:41:32,991
He's on the line from Mexico.

725
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:34,023
Thanks.

726
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:36,767
Johansen, where the holy hell
are you?

727
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:38,623
<i>I'm okay.</i>

728
00:41:38,655 --> 00:41:41,407
And our star witness Rosa
is alive and well.

729
00:41:41,439 --> 00:41:44,095
But we need to get out of here.
We need help to do it.

730
00:41:44,128 --> 00:41:45,983
All right, what city are you
near?

731
00:41:46,015 --> 00:41:47,423
<i>La Linea, right?</i>

732
00:41:48,063 --> 00:41:49,343
Yeah, it's uh,

733
00:41:49,375 --> 00:41:51,742
say a few hours away from the
prison we picked them up.

734
00:41:51,774 --> 00:41:53,438
<i>There's a U.S.
consulate in Nogales.</i>

735
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:55,198
<i>I'll let them know you
two are coming in.</i>

736
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:57,599
FBI's already down there with
Mexican federal police.

737
00:41:57,631 --> 00:41:59,422
There's some serious
shit coming down.

738
00:41:59,455 --> 00:42:01,246
They could lock you up for
twenty years.

739
00:42:01,277 --> 00:42:02,686
<i>So get to that consulate.</i>

740
00:42:02,718 --> 00:42:04,319
Okay we'll get there safe.

741
00:42:04,351 --> 00:42:05,534
Listen one thing...

742
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:10,301
she's convinced the shooters
in Silverado County were cops.

743
00:42:12,477 --> 00:42:13,245
Excuse me?

744
00:42:13,277 --> 00:42:14,716
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

745
00:42:15,357 --> 00:42:16,125
American cops.

746
00:42:16,157 --> 00:42:18,204
She seems pretty
sure of herself.

747
00:42:18,237 --> 00:42:19,069
<i>One of ours?</i>

748
00:42:19,101 --> 00:42:21,309
Well, she said she
heard them and I...

749
00:42:21,341 --> 00:42:22,845
tend to believe her.

750
00:42:24,381 --> 00:42:25,276
Chief?

751
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:26,685
<i>Just what we need right now</i>

752
00:42:26,717 --> 00:42:29,214
hard enough time fighting the
bad guys now we have to fight

753
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:31,356
the general public
and fucking IA?

754
00:42:31,387 --> 00:42:32,444
<i>Just hang tight.</i>

755
00:42:32,476 --> 00:42:34,172
- Let me think about this.
- Rosa,

756
00:42:34,204 --> 00:42:35,388
ven a comer.

757
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,771
<i>All right, I'll call you
again tomorrow</i>

758
00:42:36,795 --> 00:42:38,140
<i>or the day after, alright?</i>

759
00:42:38,172 --> 00:42:39,900
Yeah okay. We'll work it out.

760
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,020
I gotta go.

761
00:42:41,052 --> 00:42:42,396
<i>Johansen one more thing..</i>

762
00:42:47,549 --> 00:42:48,796
Lunch.

763
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,428
Es para ti.

764
00:42:50,491 --> 00:42:51,707
Ven con nosotros.

765
00:42:54,236 --> 00:42:56,188
Padre te agradecemos por
nuestros alimentos

766
00:42:56,219 --> 00:42:58,235
por favor protegenos siempre.

767
00:42:58,266 --> 00:43:00,699
Y por favor ayudanos
a salir con bien de esto.

768
00:43:00,731 --> 00:43:03,163
- Amen.
- Amen.

769
00:43:14,233 --> 00:43:15,642
Rosa...

770
00:43:15,674 --> 00:43:17,818
preguntale que si le gusta la
comida.

771
00:43:21,178 --> 00:43:22,426
You like our food?

772
00:43:23,003 --> 00:43:24,122
Oh yeah.

773
00:43:25,338 --> 00:43:27,578
Do you know what 'queso de
puerco' is?

774
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:30,809
Okay yeah. Yeah, I like cheese.

775
00:43:36,153 --> 00:43:37,785
What kind of 'queso' is it?

776
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:39,961
Dile.

777
00:43:39,993 --> 00:43:41,274
It's uhm...

778
00:43:41,306 --> 00:43:42,361
head cheese.

779
00:43:42,713 --> 00:43:44,217
Brains.

780
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:47,898
No, no, no, it's from
the pig's head.

781
00:43:48,986 --> 00:43:50,488
Well I guess that's better.

782
00:43:51,833 --> 00:43:52,888
Rosa...

783
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,264
quiero que me
traduzcas por favor.

784
00:43:55,352 --> 00:43:56,896
Dile que lamento que nos este
acompañando

785
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,999
bajo estas circumstancias

786
00:43:59,032 --> 00:44:01,144
me gustaria que fuera diferente

787
00:44:01,176 --> 00:44:04,249
pero que todos estamos
muy agradecidos por salvarte

788
00:44:04,281 --> 00:44:05,241
gracias.

789
00:44:05,273 --> 00:44:06,679
He said that

790
00:44:06,712 --> 00:44:10,423
you're a guest here but that he
apologizes for the circumstances

791
00:44:10,455 --> 00:44:13,303
and that they're all very
grateful for saving me.

792
00:44:15,159 --> 00:44:16,159
Yes.

793
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,879
A guest.

794
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:23,927
Hice lo que tuve que
hacer para salvarles a los dos

795
00:44:23,958 --> 00:44:26,071
asi como usted yo tambien soy
policia.

796
00:44:27,703 --> 00:44:28,983
Hey...

797
00:44:29,015 --> 00:44:30,870
there are bad cops here

798
00:44:30,902 --> 00:44:32,406
and in the States, too.

799
00:44:33,143 --> 00:44:34,710
My brother's honest.

800
00:44:34,742 --> 00:44:36,214
Ya le dijiste lo del cartel?

801
00:44:36,246 --> 00:44:37,815
He told me earlier
that those cops

802
00:44:37,847 --> 00:44:39,478
were paid by the Sinaloa cartel

803
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,695
to kill me and my friend.

804
00:44:40,727 --> 00:44:42,679
Well it sounds like
you're in a bad spot

805
00:44:42,711 --> 00:44:44,726
but it's got nothing
to do with me.

806
00:44:46,614 --> 00:44:47,606
And yet,

807
00:44:47,638 --> 00:44:48,950
you're the one wanted for
murder.

808
00:44:48,982 --> 00:44:50,069
What?

809
00:44:50,101 --> 00:44:53,238
They said you killed the federal
and the two Mexican cops.

810
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:57,173
The authorities are looking
for you. It's all over the news.

811
00:44:57,205 --> 00:45:00,405
Then why am I sitting
at a policeman's table

812
00:45:00,436 --> 00:45:02,229
having lunch with his family?

813
00:45:04,885 --> 00:45:07,125
Why am I cuffed to a damn bed?

814
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:10,173
Huh.

815
00:45:12,052 --> 00:45:13,268
La familia es todo.

816
00:45:13,301 --> 00:45:14,612
Family is everything.

817
00:45:14,644 --> 00:45:17,045
Dile que cuando se siente mejor
lo llevo a la frontera.

818
00:45:17,077 --> 00:45:18,109
Por lo pronto se queda aqui

819
00:45:18,133 --> 00:45:19,452
que hay mucha gente
buscandolo fuera.

820
00:45:19,476 --> 00:45:21,660
He said when you're healthy
he'll take you to the States

821
00:45:21,684 --> 00:45:23,219
but until then you have
to hide inside

822
00:45:23,252 --> 00:45:24,636
because we're all dead
if you don't.

823
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:28,468
- There are spies everywhere.
- Okay, okay but what about her?

824
00:45:32,243 --> 00:45:33,267
Ella se queda

825
00:45:33,299 --> 00:45:34,611
aqui.

826
00:45:36,051 --> 00:45:37,075
He said I stay here.

827
00:45:37,107 --> 00:45:38,963
No, I can't do that.

828
00:45:39,955 --> 00:45:41,587
I came down to get her.

829
00:45:41,619 --> 00:45:44,499
She can help solve
who killed those DEA agents.

830
00:45:44,531 --> 00:45:46,100
In America, we can protect..

831
00:45:46,131 --> 00:45:47,379
No you can't!

832
00:45:59,186 --> 00:46:00,186
Go.

833
00:46:00,786 --> 00:46:02,107
- Ahora.
- We should talk about this.

834
00:46:02,131 --> 00:46:03,474
This is bullshit.

835
00:46:04,051 --> 00:46:05,330
Agh.

836
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:07,410
You're making a huge mistake,
buddy.

837
00:46:09,107 --> 00:46:11,345
What's wrong with this country?

838
00:46:19,089 --> 00:46:19,985
Miguel?

839
00:46:20,017 --> 00:46:21,017
Hmm.

840
00:46:25,937 --> 00:46:26,937
No.

841
00:46:43,601 --> 00:46:44,601
Miguel.

842
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:10,092
You need
to unlock me!

843
00:48:10,155 --> 00:48:12,491
I need the handcuff
keys back here!

844
00:48:13,355 --> 00:48:14,355
I need the keys!

845
00:48:23,755 --> 00:48:25,964
They're coming in to
the back over here!

846
00:48:26,795 --> 00:48:27,795
Hurry up!

847
00:48:39,787 --> 00:48:40,969
Behind you! Watch out!

848
00:49:27,369 --> 00:49:28,393
Ahh!

849
00:49:53,735 --> 00:49:54,885
Hey!

850
00:49:58,918 --> 00:49:59,918
You okay?

851
00:50:03,654 --> 00:50:06,215
Ahh shit.

852
00:50:06,247 --> 00:50:07,911
They're coming to
the front door.

853
00:50:16,261 --> 00:50:17,861
Todo va a estar bien, Ma.

854
00:50:36,517 --> 00:50:37,605
You okay?

855
00:50:37,637 --> 00:50:38,757
You okay?

856
00:50:38,789 --> 00:50:39,717
Yes.

857
00:50:39,749 --> 00:50:41,253
- Stay down.
- Si okay.

858
00:51:03,332 --> 00:51:04,452
Damn it.

859
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:13,155
Se tiene que ir.

860
00:51:14,755 --> 00:51:15,755
Los dos.

861
00:51:16,291 --> 00:51:17,827
He said we got to go.

862
00:51:17,859 --> 00:51:18,859
Both of us.

863
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:20,483
Way ahead of you.

864
00:51:20,963 --> 00:51:22,241
Thanks...

865
00:51:22,723 --> 00:51:23,723
for everything.

866
00:52:02,945 --> 00:52:06,656
Esto es nuestra señora
de Guadalupe.

867
00:52:06,689 --> 00:52:08,417
Thats our lady
of Guadalupe.

868
00:52:08,449 --> 00:52:10,528
She's a symbol of our identity

869
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:13,632
and also of social justice and
femininity.

870
00:52:13,664 --> 00:52:15,232
Great. My favorites.

871
00:52:15,264 --> 00:52:18,016
Si quieres pelear con los lobos
tienes que ser un lobo.

872
00:52:18,048 --> 00:52:20,192
If you want to fight with the
wolves...

873
00:52:20,224 --> 00:52:21,248
you got to be a wolf.

874
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,783
I know.

875
00:52:23,136 --> 00:52:24,136
Gracias.

876
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:28,832
Mija.

877
00:52:28,864 --> 00:52:30,334
Mi princesa.

878
00:52:33,246 --> 00:52:35,197
Gotta go.

879
00:53:50,906 --> 00:53:52,283
What are you doing?

880
00:53:53,499 --> 00:53:54,683
Calling my boss, telling him

881
00:53:54,715 --> 00:53:55,971
we're skipping his
fed chaperones.

882
00:53:55,995 --> 00:53:57,595
Going with your connections.

883
00:53:57,626 --> 00:53:58,843
Coyotes, right?

884
00:53:58,875 --> 00:54:00,899
Every time you call that fucking
guy someone tries to

885
00:54:00,923 --> 00:54:02,843
come and kill us.
Are you stupid or something?

886
00:54:02,875 --> 00:54:04,835
I'm sorry, I've known
him for twenty five years Rosa.

887
00:54:04,859 --> 00:54:06,939
Then how do you explain what
happened at my house

888
00:54:06,971 --> 00:54:08,282
when you called him?

889
00:54:08,314 --> 00:54:09,691
My cousin is dead!

890
00:54:09,723 --> 00:54:13,690
- I can't. I can't. I'm sorry.
- My cousin is dead! He's dead!

891
00:54:13,721 --> 00:54:16,186
Okay, okay.
Calm down. Calm down.

892
00:54:16,218 --> 00:54:19,290
And my mom almost died
and Miguel's hurt.

893
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:21,210
I'm sorry about Salvador.

894
00:54:21,242 --> 00:54:22,649
He was a good man.

895
00:54:23,034 --> 00:54:24,034
All right.

896
00:54:24,826 --> 00:54:25,882
Okay?

897
00:54:25,914 --> 00:54:26,914
You okay?

898
00:54:27,322 --> 00:54:28,634
All right.

899
00:54:30,969 --> 00:54:34,649
So who do you know that you
trust that you can call?

900
00:54:38,585 --> 00:54:39,864
There's this...

901
00:54:39,896 --> 00:54:42,137
There's this old buddy of mine,
Brynner.

902
00:54:42,168 --> 00:54:43,193
He's a tough guy.

903
00:54:43,832 --> 00:54:44,985
Yeah I trust him.

904
00:54:46,233 --> 00:54:48,888
So call him and tell him to come
and get us when we cross, okay?

905
00:54:50,423 --> 00:54:51,704
Okay.

906
00:54:58,680 --> 00:54:59,992
Over there.

907
00:55:00,023 --> 00:55:01,176
Keep going.

908
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:23,831
Is it set up?

909
00:55:23,863 --> 00:55:25,055
He said they'll take us
to the border

910
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:26,967
and then we're on our own.

911
00:55:26,999 --> 00:55:28,695
Tell your friend he can
pick us up there.

912
00:55:28,727 --> 00:55:30,741
We leave tomorrow at midnight.

913
00:55:34,326 --> 00:55:35,549
<i>Remember call me</i>
<i>when you get across.</i>

914
00:55:35,573 --> 00:55:36,854
That's right.

915
00:55:36,885 --> 00:55:38,774
<i>You hang in there.
I'll get you home soon.</i>

916
00:55:38,805 --> 00:55:39,894
Yeah, I know.

917
00:55:40,598 --> 00:55:42,486
We'll be here till then.

918
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:45,173
Hey, Brynner.

919
00:55:45,494 --> 00:55:46,550
<i>Yeah?</i>

920
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:48,182
Thanks, buddy.

921
00:55:49,046 --> 00:55:50,197
<i>No sweat.</i>

922
00:55:54,837 --> 00:55:56,725
You hungry?

923
00:55:56,757 --> 00:55:58,869
I know a place that
still delivers.

924
00:55:58,901 --> 00:55:59,668
Okay.

925
00:56:01,141 --> 00:56:03,285
My mother's money came in handy.

926
00:56:03,317 --> 00:56:05,717
The coyotes charged
us $4,000 each.

927
00:56:09,013 --> 00:56:10,548
That's a lot of money.

928
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:12,532
Bringing people across
is big business.

929
00:56:14,388 --> 00:56:15,764
Thanks.

930
00:56:15,796 --> 00:56:18,004
Well I always pay back my debts.

931
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:19,292
Hmm.

932
00:56:21,172 --> 00:56:22,324
You're welcome...

933
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:25,044
Johansen.

934
00:56:28,309 --> 00:56:29,683
Mike.

935
00:56:30,611 --> 00:56:32,403
My name is Mike.

936
00:56:32,435 --> 00:56:34,323
You're welcome, Mike.

937
00:56:36,467 --> 00:56:37,459
You have a family?

938
00:56:37,491 --> 00:56:40,147
Got married twice,
divorced twice, and that's it.

939
00:56:40,179 --> 00:56:41,179
Oh, no kids.

940
00:56:41,906 --> 00:56:43,187
End of story.

941
00:57:01,778 --> 00:57:02,929
Hey.

942
00:57:11,568 --> 00:57:13,457
You miss your home?

943
00:57:14,481 --> 00:57:15,793
Do I miss my home?

944
00:57:16,464 --> 00:57:18,353
Yeah, I guess.

945
00:57:21,841 --> 00:57:23,792
My best friend,

946
00:57:23,825 --> 00:57:25,233
she grew up watching her

947
00:57:25,265 --> 00:57:27,762
mother and her grandmother

948
00:57:27,794 --> 00:57:29,777
go from nothing to nowhere.

949
00:57:29,808 --> 00:57:32,112
Just living a life of struggle
and pain.

950
00:57:35,311 --> 00:57:38,832
But she knew a place
where everyone had a chance.

951
00:57:40,336 --> 00:57:41,488
America.

952
00:57:43,121 --> 00:57:45,392
She paid a coyote group to get
us across.

953
00:57:46,352 --> 00:57:48,945
And she had a cousin
in Los Angeles who would

954
00:57:48,976 --> 00:57:51,055
raise me and put me
through school.

955
00:57:52,911 --> 00:57:55,151
But she never set foot on
American soil.

956
00:57:55,183 --> 00:57:58,063
She died a hundred yards
away from her dream for me.

957
00:57:59,727 --> 00:58:02,991
With two fat, slobbering
coyote scumbags

958
00:58:03,023 --> 00:58:04,751
breathing down her face.

959
00:58:04,783 --> 00:58:07,535
And I got away before
they could do the same to me.

960
00:58:09,775 --> 00:58:11,630
So at sixteen...

961
00:58:13,518 --> 00:58:14,925
I lived on the streets...

962
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:16,174
undocumented.

963
00:58:17,647 --> 00:58:19,918
And you learn some things there.

964
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:22,030
Some things you shouldn't
have to learn.

965
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:25,518
But I survived the States.

966
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:26,830
I stayed alive.

967
00:58:28,174 --> 00:58:29,710
And I know I can do it again.

968
00:58:31,182 --> 00:58:32,556
Well, I'm sure you can.

969
00:58:34,509 --> 00:58:36,013
Look, it's late.

970
00:58:36,044 --> 00:58:37,549
Let's get some sleep.

971
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:15,498
Yeah?

972
00:59:15,531 --> 00:59:17,611
Any dumb ass cop in
there who want a ride

973
00:59:17,643 --> 00:59:19,755
back to the land of the free?

974
00:59:19,787 --> 00:59:20,587
Hilts?

975
00:59:20,619 --> 00:59:22,218
Don't shoot me, big guy.

976
00:59:26,058 --> 00:59:27,115
Fuckin' Mexico, man.

977
00:59:27,147 --> 00:59:29,099
I've been telling you
since I saw..

978
00:59:29,131 --> 00:59:30,131
Hey!

979
00:59:30,474 --> 00:59:31,338
Hey!

980
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:32,681
Ahh fu..

981
00:59:32,714 --> 00:59:33,993
Are you packing?

982
00:59:34,026 --> 00:59:34,953
No!

983
00:59:34,986 --> 00:59:36,042
Okay, turn around.

984
00:59:39,339 --> 00:59:41,354
Glad to see we're still
good friends.

985
00:59:41,386 --> 00:59:42,666
How'd you know I was here?

986
00:59:43,051 --> 00:59:44,426
Hernandez?

987
00:59:44,458 --> 00:59:46,923
Your heart felt call to an old
buddy traced back to a village

988
00:59:46,955 --> 00:59:49,034
about eight miles
down the highway.

989
00:59:49,066 --> 00:59:51,241
Three hotels between
it and the great wall.

990
00:59:52,201 --> 00:59:53,097
Still got it.

991
00:59:53,129 --> 00:59:54,089
Alright.

992
00:59:54,121 --> 00:59:55,881
So why in the hell are you here?

993
00:59:56,554 --> 00:59:57,673
We.

994
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:07,336
Look, it's a shit show
back in the States.

995
01:00:07,369 --> 01:00:09,385
Internal Affairs and the
FBI are all working

996
01:00:09,417 --> 01:00:11,464
on coming down here and
grabbing you today.

997
01:00:11,496 --> 01:00:13,769
We're thinking it's best
to do it this way.

998
01:00:13,801 --> 01:00:15,464
No press, no bullshit,
nobody knows.

999
01:00:15,496 --> 01:00:16,584
Just us.

1000
01:00:16,617 --> 01:00:19,657
But we're planning to go
with her contacts, the Coyotes,

1001
01:00:19,688 --> 01:00:20,904
tonight.

1002
01:00:21,224 --> 01:00:22,224
Hey man,

1003
01:00:22,537 --> 01:00:23,848
trusting's hard.

1004
01:00:24,488 --> 01:00:26,024
Knowing who to trust...

1005
01:00:26,535 --> 01:00:27,944
is even harder.

1006
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,535
Hello, Miss.

1007
01:00:30,567 --> 01:00:31,367
I'm Hilts.

1008
01:00:31,399 --> 01:00:32,711
Old buddy of Mike's here.

1009
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,024
Yeah,

1010
01:00:34,056 --> 01:00:36,295
he's with that guy I
called to meet us.

1011
01:00:36,743 --> 01:00:37,511
That's right,

1012
01:00:37,543 --> 01:00:38,983
Brought the old boys club.

1013
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,351
Okay, so where are we crossing?

1014
01:00:41,383 --> 01:00:42,503
Close to where you came in.

1015
01:00:42,536 --> 01:00:45,671
So get yourselves ready
and meet us out back in five.

1016
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:48,328
Okay.

1017
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:50,247
Good to have you back buddy.

1018
01:00:50,279 --> 01:00:51,462
- Hey Hilts...
- Yeah?

1019
01:00:51,493 --> 01:00:52,902
Thanks for sticking by me.

1020
01:00:59,462 --> 01:01:02,502
Alright, let's get out of here
while we still can.

1021
01:01:10,661 --> 01:01:12,933
Young lady, your chariot.

1022
01:01:20,196 --> 01:01:22,212
God, I've missed this work.

1023
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:25,189
Let's roll, Chief.

1024
01:01:26,661 --> 01:01:28,742
Vacation's over, Johansen.

1025
01:01:28,774 --> 01:01:29,900
You look like hell, by the way.

1026
01:01:31,044 --> 01:01:33,027
- Good to see you, Brynner.
- Yeah, ha ha.

1027
01:01:47,653 --> 01:01:49,476
So many questions, my friend.

1028
01:01:49,508 --> 01:01:50,914
Oh-ho.

1029
01:01:50,947 --> 01:01:52,740
You okay? You feel all right?

1030
01:01:52,772 --> 01:01:53,923
Yeah, somewhat tired.

1031
01:01:53,955 --> 01:01:55,652
I got a 0.9mm
through and through

1032
01:01:55,683 --> 01:01:56,899
right by the spleen there,

1033
01:01:56,931 --> 01:01:59,492
and I need to have it
checked out.

1034
01:01:59,523 --> 01:02:01,763
Don't worry about it.
We'll take care of you.

1035
01:02:02,659 --> 01:02:04,483
Alright, which way home?

1036
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:06,403
Left.

1037
01:02:06,435 --> 01:02:08,419
Okay, let's blow this pop stand.

1038
01:02:22,018 --> 01:02:23,139
Rosa...

1039
01:02:23,171 --> 01:02:26,019
surprised you got this far
with this guy helping you out.

1040
01:02:28,227 --> 01:02:29,282
But...

1041
01:02:30,497 --> 01:02:32,225
happy to finally have you.

1042
01:02:36,065 --> 01:02:38,626
Hard to believe I am
so willing...

1043
01:02:38,657 --> 01:02:40,450
to risk my ass to be
the one to bring

1044
01:02:40,481 --> 01:02:43,681
the fugitive Johansen back
across the Mexican border...

1045
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:45,728
illegally.

1046
01:02:49,568 --> 01:02:50,880
The irony, huh?

1047
01:02:52,193 --> 01:02:53,344
So, Joe...

1048
01:02:54,113 --> 01:02:55,264
how's your head?

1049
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,432
Taking this all in okay?

1050
01:02:58,463 --> 01:03:02,272
Ready to put this mess
behind you and get back home?

1051
01:03:02,303 --> 01:03:05,791
Yeah, well, I'm ready
for a damn bath anyway.

1052
01:03:08,513 --> 01:03:09,887
So which way are we going?

1053
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:12,448
Pretty near the regular
crossing.

1054
01:03:12,479 --> 01:03:14,782
Got a couple of amigos
helping us out.

1055
01:03:22,592 --> 01:03:24,382
So tell me...

1056
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:27,488
what does an aging retired
cop do for fun?

1057
01:03:27,519 --> 01:03:29,344
Do you ever get bored?

1058
01:03:29,376 --> 01:03:30,687
Miss the chase?

1059
01:03:30,718 --> 01:03:31,902
The control?

1060
01:03:33,118 --> 01:03:36,287
Is it hard to just let it all go
and become a normal nobody...

1061
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:38,111
- ...cares about you civilian?
- Come on.

1062
01:03:41,247 --> 01:03:42,334
Guess what?

1063
01:03:43,550 --> 01:03:45,727
Nobody cared about me before.

1064
01:03:56,446 --> 01:03:57,917
<i>There were</i>
<i>two of them.</i>

1065
01:03:59,102 --> 01:04:01,086
<i>Let it go.</i>
<i>Let's blow this pop stand.</i>

1066
01:04:04,830 --> 01:04:05,982
<i>No, no, no!</i>

1067
01:04:18,492 --> 01:04:20,763
Si quieres pelear con los lobos

1068
01:04:21,533 --> 01:04:23,037
tiene que ser un lobo.

1069
01:04:26,045 --> 01:04:27,772
What's that about a wolf?

1070
01:04:29,725 --> 01:04:30,780
Yeah.

1071
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:34,202
If you want to fight the
wolves you gotta be a...

1072
01:04:34,876 --> 01:04:36,860
wolf.

1073
01:04:36,892 --> 01:04:39,195
The fuck is that
supposed to mean?

1074
01:04:46,011 --> 01:04:47,931
These
are the wolves.

1075
01:04:47,964 --> 01:04:49,020
Trust me.

1076
01:05:15,226 --> 01:05:16,569
Hey Brynner...

1077
01:05:16,601 --> 01:05:18,457
can I talk to you for a second?

1078
01:05:18,489 --> 01:05:19,802
Yeah, sure.

1079
01:05:21,849 --> 01:05:24,057
- Outside.
- Oh.

1080
01:05:25,336 --> 01:05:26,490
Yeah okay, yeah.

1081
01:05:26,522 --> 01:05:28,057
Let's pull up over there.

1082
01:05:54,711 --> 01:05:56,120
Let's go down here.

1083
01:06:08,343 --> 01:06:10,647
Listen, I need to
ask you something.

1084
01:06:10,679 --> 01:06:11,383
Sure.

1085
01:06:11,414 --> 01:06:13,431
That night at the warehouse...

1086
01:06:14,359 --> 01:06:15,447
the DEA murders...

1087
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:19,127
the killers may have been cops.

1088
01:06:19,159 --> 01:06:20,087
Cops?

1089
01:06:20,119 --> 01:06:20,567
Yeah.

1090
01:06:20,599 --> 01:06:21,686
Jesus you know...

1091
01:06:21,717 --> 01:06:23,670
We gotta get you to a doc
boss man, come on.

1092
01:06:23,702 --> 01:06:25,367
- I was wondering...
- Let's get going.

1093
01:06:25,399 --> 01:06:26,654
Maybe your twenty
something years

1094
01:06:26,678 --> 01:06:28,470
of being an outstanding
officer of the law

1095
01:06:28,502 --> 01:06:30,293
has a scent about all that.

1096
01:06:30,325 --> 01:06:31,510
An instinct or two.

1097
01:06:32,470 --> 01:06:33,534
Hey Joe, it's
getting hot out here.

1098
01:06:33,558 --> 01:06:34,422
I'm fucking retired.

1099
01:06:34,453 --> 01:06:36,020
They don't tell me shit anymore.

1100
01:06:36,053 --> 01:06:37,366
Come on what's the word fellas?

1101
01:06:37,398 --> 01:06:39,574
Joe's concerned that the beauty
queen may have told him

1102
01:06:39,605 --> 01:06:40,916
that there's some
police officers

1103
01:06:40,949 --> 01:06:42,550
involved in the
Silverado shooting.

1104
01:06:42,582 --> 01:06:45,430
- Cops? She told you that?
- Yeah.

1105
01:06:45,462 --> 01:06:47,573
What's going on?
Did someone get carsick?

1106
01:06:53,652 --> 01:06:55,412
Hey, this isn't the
place for this.

1107
01:06:55,444 --> 01:06:56,444
No.

1108
01:06:56,469 --> 01:06:57,973
No.

1109
01:06:58,005 --> 01:07:00,405
Actually, it's the
perfect place.

1110
01:07:00,437 --> 01:07:02,709
Give it up. Give up your piece
come on.

1111
01:07:02,741 --> 01:07:04,437
We're gonna have to have a
little chat.

1112
01:07:04,468 --> 01:07:05,875
Mike, give it to him.

1113
01:07:05,908 --> 01:07:07,605
Come on.
Come on.

1114
01:07:07,637 --> 01:07:08,659
Okay.

1115
01:07:08,692 --> 01:07:10,771
Look, we're here
to save you, Joe.

1116
01:07:10,803 --> 01:07:13,268
That night was
meant to be an easy in and out.

1117
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:14,836
No shots, no dead,

1118
01:07:14,868 --> 01:07:15,924
easy cash.

1119
01:07:17,012 --> 01:07:18,330
We're gonna big 'fuck you' to
those cartel assholes

1120
01:07:18,354 --> 01:07:20,084
bringing their shit
poison into our country.

1121
01:07:20,116 --> 01:07:21,203
It is what it is.

1122
01:07:21,234 --> 01:07:23,123
Yeah, the DEA wasn't
supposed to be there.

1123
01:07:23,154 --> 01:07:24,796
We didn't know.
We were there for the money.

1124
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:27,059
You know how it is these
days you make one shit mistake,

1125
01:07:27,091 --> 01:07:28,124
some asshole's down your throat

1126
01:07:28,148 --> 01:07:30,067
trying to defund you and
demoralize you.

1127
01:07:30,099 --> 01:07:32,147
Do we miss the body cams
and the TV? No.

1128
01:07:32,179 --> 01:07:34,963
But the rest of it, the chase,
the control, the power,

1129
01:07:34,995 --> 01:07:35,923
yeah, I miss it.

1130
01:07:35,955 --> 01:07:38,803
I do. We need it Joe.
You need it too.

1131
01:07:41,650 --> 01:07:43,763
All right, we don't
have enough time.

1132
01:07:43,795 --> 01:07:45,298
Go get her.

1133
01:07:56,114 --> 01:07:58,130
- Ahh! No!
- Easy, easy, bitch.

1134
01:07:58,162 --> 01:07:59,505
No, no, no!

1135
01:08:00,722 --> 01:08:02,738
Don't fucking touch me!

1136
01:08:02,769 --> 01:08:03,698
Come on!

1137
01:08:03,729 --> 01:08:05,842
I wish to hell I'd made
that night disappear

1138
01:08:05,874 --> 01:08:07,154
but we can do that right now,

1139
01:08:07,185 --> 01:08:08,272
right here.

1140
01:08:08,305 --> 01:08:10,353
Look, we just take
care of her and we drive.

1141
01:08:10,385 --> 01:08:12,241
That's it, we just drive
away all right?

1142
01:08:12,273 --> 01:08:13,560
I'm sorry they sent
you down here for this Joe.

1143
01:08:13,584 --> 01:08:14,513
Okay.

1144
01:08:14,544 --> 01:08:15,992
I've tried to talk the
chief out of it but..

1145
01:08:16,016 --> 01:08:17,529
It's too late for this,
we don't need this.

1146
01:08:17,553 --> 01:08:18,711
You dragged me across the border

1147
01:08:18,735 --> 01:08:20,304
just to leave me here
to fucking die?

1148
01:08:20,337 --> 01:08:22,073
I should have just stayed
with my mom and Miguel!

1149
01:08:22,097 --> 01:08:22,993
Shut up!

1150
01:08:23,025 --> 01:08:23,953
Hey, wait.

1151
01:08:23,985 --> 01:08:25,721
- Stupid bitch.
- Wait listen.

1152
01:08:25,745 --> 01:08:27,440
Please don't let them kill me.

1153
01:08:27,471 --> 01:08:28,944
There's gotta be another way.

1154
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:31,504
The girl's gotta go.

1155
01:08:31,952 --> 01:08:32,848
Easy, Chief.

1156
01:08:32,879 --> 01:08:34,032
What are you doing?

1157
01:08:34,063 --> 01:08:35,576
He's coming back with us.
We talked about this.

1158
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:37,103
You gotta let her go Joe.

1159
01:08:37,135 --> 01:08:38,776
Let's let this Mexican shit
hole flush itself

1160
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:40,432
and we'll all get the
hell back home.

1161
01:08:40,879 --> 01:08:42,352
What do you say?

1162
01:08:42,383 --> 01:08:43,952
Let her go, Joe.

1163
01:08:48,336 --> 01:08:49,903
Or do we dig two graves?

1164
01:08:49,935 --> 01:08:51,543
- Brynner I'm talking to you!
- What the fuck!

1165
01:08:51,567 --> 01:08:53,775
Calm the fuck down!
What the hell's wrong with you.

1166
01:08:53,807 --> 01:08:55,095
- Don't do this!
- You outta your fucking mind?

1167
01:08:59,599 --> 01:09:00,599
Uh!

1168
01:09:01,807 --> 01:09:03,279
What the fuck.

1169
01:09:03,311 --> 01:09:04,367
Fuck.

1170
01:09:10,668 --> 01:09:12,046
Joe, wait a minute.

1171
01:09:12,078 --> 01:09:14,670
Come on, man.
Don't. Gimme a break here man.

1172
01:09:15,790 --> 01:09:16,910
Agh!

1173
01:09:49,485 --> 01:09:51,148
You fucking bitch!

1174
01:10:10,955 --> 01:10:12,427
Stay down!

1175
01:10:34,538 --> 01:10:36,008
Oh fuck.

1176
01:10:40,394 --> 01:10:41,394
Sorry.

1177
01:10:51,464 --> 01:10:52,873
Fucking Mexico.

1178
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:25,992
Okay.

1179
01:11:49,415 --> 01:11:50,662
You okay?

1180
01:11:50,694 --> 01:11:51,845
Yeah.

1181
01:11:53,702 --> 01:11:55,014
Here, take this.

1182
01:11:59,173 --> 01:12:00,614
We leave at midnight.

1183
01:14:02,495 --> 01:14:04,448
Muchachos lo hicimos!

1184
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:06,591
Lo hicimos! Felicidades!

1185
01:15:25,307 --> 01:15:26,307
Thanks.

1186
01:15:28,092 --> 01:15:28,795
Alright.

1187
01:15:28,828 --> 01:15:30,043
- Congrats.
- Thanks, man.

1188
01:15:31,674 --> 01:15:33,851
Feels good, doesn't it?

1189
01:15:33,883 --> 01:15:35,324
What's that?

1190
01:15:35,356 --> 01:15:36,763
When the crap ends.

1191
01:15:37,819 --> 01:15:38,236
Yeah.

1192
01:15:38,268 --> 01:15:39,515
Pretty good.

1193
01:15:39,547 --> 01:15:41,699
Hey, better when they love you
than when they hate you,

1194
01:15:41,723 --> 01:15:42,811
you gotta admit.

1195
01:15:43,675 --> 01:15:45,466
Can't argue there.

1196
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:47,099
Ha ha Johansen.

1197
01:15:47,130 --> 01:15:49,083
There wasn't much
future left for you

1198
01:15:49,115 --> 01:15:51,707
and somehow you
found it you son of a bitch.

1199
01:15:51,738 --> 01:15:53,786
Commendations and all.

1200
01:15:55,002 --> 01:15:55,994
Thankfully,

1201
01:15:56,025 --> 01:15:57,658
the rest of the guys, well...

1202
01:15:58,522 --> 01:15:59,770
they deserve to just be

1203
01:15:59,802 --> 01:16:01,018
forgotten.

1204
01:16:02,171 --> 01:16:03,546
And they will be.

1205
01:16:04,282 --> 01:16:05,466
That's right.

1206
01:16:06,585 --> 01:16:08,514
I still got a lot of work
to clean up in the department

1207
01:16:08,538 --> 01:16:11,577
but at least you're no longer
the monster in the closet.

1208
01:16:12,697 --> 01:16:13,912
Keep it that way.

1209
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:15,897
No problem.

1210
01:16:19,705 --> 01:16:21,017
Oh well, well.

1211
01:16:21,049 --> 01:16:22,817
Must have been months since
you two didn't have

1212
01:16:22,841 --> 01:16:24,889
nineteen lawyers between you.

1213
01:16:25,753 --> 01:16:26,753
Go ahead.

1214
01:16:28,664 --> 01:16:30,488
Thanks boss.

1215
01:16:33,913 --> 01:16:35,192
Ugh.

1216
01:16:40,183 --> 01:16:41,112
Hi.

1217
01:16:41,143 --> 01:16:42,143
Hi.

1218
01:16:43,513 --> 01:16:44,631
Nice speech in there.

1219
01:16:44,664 --> 01:16:45,664
Oh, really?

1220
01:16:45,943 --> 01:16:47,064
Meh.

1221
01:16:47,096 --> 01:16:48,504
Good enough.

1222
01:16:50,104 --> 01:16:52,855
Look, I tried to contact
you but they wouldn't let me.

1223
01:16:52,887 --> 01:16:54,711
With all the stupid legal stuff.

1224
01:16:55,511 --> 01:16:56,792
I know.

1225
01:16:57,303 --> 01:16:58,840
So,

1226
01:16:58,872 --> 01:17:00,728
how do you feel, Mr...

1227
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:03,287
Medal of Honor police man?

1228
01:17:03,799 --> 01:17:05,175
Like Swiss cheese.

1229
01:17:05,207 --> 01:17:08,087
Two more surgeries.
Still have to fix the ankle.

1230
01:17:09,207 --> 01:17:11,670
Fallen apart. What can I say?

1231
01:17:11,702 --> 01:17:14,902
Well, you look better
in pieces than

1232
01:17:14,934 --> 01:17:16,854
most men do, put together.

1233
01:17:16,886 --> 01:17:19,414
Really? Thanks.

1234
01:17:19,446 --> 01:17:21,654
I mean, you're...
You look very...

1235
01:17:22,967 --> 01:17:24,054
Pretty?

1236
01:17:25,142 --> 01:17:26,910
I mean I don't want to put words
in your mouth, but...

1237
01:17:26,934 --> 01:17:29,654
Yeah, I was going
to say something like that.

1238
01:17:29,687 --> 01:17:30,933
So, how are you doing?

1239
01:17:31,510 --> 01:17:32,510
Well,

1240
01:17:33,141 --> 01:17:35,190
the DA cut me a pretty
sweet deal so

1241
01:17:35,222 --> 01:17:39,541
I'm now on my way to becoming
an official U.S. citizen.

1242
01:17:40,053 --> 01:17:41,206
Really?

1243
01:17:41,237 --> 01:17:42,293
Great.

1244
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:44,022
- Yeah.
- Ha ha.

1245
01:17:44,053 --> 01:17:46,997
Well, that's,
that's great, yeah.

1246
01:17:47,028 --> 01:17:48,501
Well you deserve it.

1247
01:17:49,269 --> 01:17:51,796
You know, maybe I'll, um...

1248
01:17:51,827 --> 01:17:53,812
Maybe I'll see you around.

1249
01:17:54,292 --> 01:17:55,732
Maybe you will.

1250
01:17:58,036 --> 01:17:59,636
Yeah. Okay.

1251
01:18:05,236 --> 01:18:06,676
All right.

1252
01:18:09,524 --> 01:18:10,611
See you around.

1253
01:18:18,995 --> 01:18:20,436
Hey, Rosa?

1254
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:25,619
You like American coffee?

1255
01:18:26,932 --> 01:18:28,371
It's the best.

1256
01:18:30,321 --> 01:18:32,050
I know a place.

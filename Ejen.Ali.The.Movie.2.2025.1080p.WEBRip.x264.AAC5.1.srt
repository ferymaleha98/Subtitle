3
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:41,833
Open the door now!

4
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:47,000
Being stubborn, are we?

5
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,625
You're the big boss, I assume?

6
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:53,416
Please. Don't.

7
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:59,416
Don't make me repeat myself.

8
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,416
Wait. You... You don't understand.

9
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,000
The Azurium here is still in its raw form.

10
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:06,250
It's unstable.

11
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:07,791
If it's disturbed,

12
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:10,000
it could cause a massive explosion.

13
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:13,166
Is that supposed to scare me?

14
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,625
The bigger, the better!

15
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:22,208
Let him go!

16
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:31,708
Pathetic. Toss him out!

17
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:34,875
Anyone else want to be a hero?

18
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:42,208
Sir.

19
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:45,208
If we want to make it out of here alive,
we should do as he says.

20
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,666
Get in!

21
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,041
You think you're so tough?

22
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:52,458
Let's see if you can swim.

23
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:56,375
Which way is the exit?

24
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:58,125
This way, bro!

25
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:00,666
Okay, thanks.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,833
Who are you?

27
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:08,666
What are you doing here?

28
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:19,041
How did these pirates get in here?

29
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,708
All done, let's go!

30
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:22,916
Wait.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,833
What?

32
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:25,708
Did you pay attention to the brief?

33
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:26,750
We wait for IRIS.

34
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:30,458
What's taking so long?

35
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:35,125
Turn the burner off.

36
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,708
Hey, what are you waiting for?

37
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:13,666
Attack!

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,375
Come here! Don't run away!

39
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:58,916
Move!

40
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:04,166
Biting off more than you can chew?

41
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,291
Don't drop them!

42
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:23,833
Are we done?

43
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:29,583
Put him here.

44
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,375
Where are we getting food later, doctor?

45
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,625
Be quiet.

46
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,916
Alicia, what's wrong?

47
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,541
- Are you seasick?
- Stop...

48
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:46,625
Stop him.

49
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:57,916
Stay back!

50
00:04:58,458 --> 00:04:59,958
Or I'll toss this one.

51
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,833
Bakar, Bobby, don't let them escape!

52
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,541
Nothing's working!

53
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:29,625
Let me try.

54
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,083
Be careful, Bobby.

55
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,333
Watch the bag!

56
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,916
Stop moving around so much, bro!

57
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,958
See you!

58
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:04,541
Wait for me!

59
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,291
Everything's under control.

60
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,208
Way to go, Alicia!

61
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,166
Well done.

62
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,000
You're definitely a step up
from that sniveling kid.

63
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,666
Wait.

64
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,000
Is he talking about Ali?

65
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:48,541
<i>Ali.</i>

66
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,666
<i>Ali, are you ready?</i>

67
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:56,625
Yes.

68
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,083
SATRIA, status.

69
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:22,791
<i>The current compatibility level
is approximately 60%.</i>

70
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:26,875
We need to train more Pillar functions
to raise the overall percentage.

71
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,208
I know that.

72
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,125
I was asking about the mission.

73
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,750
Do you think he can handle it?

74
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,583
He must.

75
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,375
This is the only chance we've got.

76
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,250
{\an8}He's here.

77
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,750
Dato'.

78
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:49,833
I believe you're acquainted

79
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,291
with my head of security,

80
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,375
Amir.

81
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:55,500
Dayang, Ganz, it's been a while

82
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:58,541
since we worked together.

83
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,291
Mission Batu Lesung, was it?

84
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,083
How's your arm?

85
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,708
Good as new.

86
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:06,916
Perhaps next time, it will be
my turn to rescue you?

87
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,500
And this is Elle.

88
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:09,916
My niece.

89
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,583
She has been my eyes and ears
for all operations in the city.

90
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,916
I've decided to appoint them

91
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,416
as the Pillar Leaders
for Neuro and Inviso.

92
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,208
That's great.

93
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:28,791
I hope that we can protect Cyberaya
more effectively.

94
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,500
So, what is it that you wanted to show me?

95
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,708
Oh no.

96
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,416
We're too exposed.

97
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,708
<i>We can take them out from a distance.</i>

98
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,166
Not again.

99
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:04,250
<i>SATRIA is equipped with data
from all MATA agents</i>

100
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:07,416
<i>to enable it to carry out
the functions of all four Pillars.</i>

101
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:09,666
We figured that

102
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,916
after Zain and Djin's passing,

103
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,125
the best way to continue operations
is to combine the Pillars.

104
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,416
This is to avoid an imbalance.

105
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,166
Why a young agent?

106
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,583
Is there no other suitable candidate?

107
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:24,333
<i>He's the only one with experience</i>

108
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,666
<i>in the IRIS dimension.</i>

109
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,416
<i>It's similar to the system used
to control SATRIA.</i>

110
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,208
SATRIA...

111
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,041
<i>Use the</i> gasing <i>barrier.</i>

112
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:51,500
<i>Now.</i>

113
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:02,416
Wouldn't it be more efficient to use AI?

114
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,208
SATRIA's AI will be there to assist,

115
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:08,041
but Ali will decide the course of action.

116
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:11,125
AI will never be able
to replace the human instinct

117
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,666
when evaluating complex decisions
during missions.

118
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,000
<i>Device is in danger.</i>

119
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,250
<i>Ali, we need a more strategic defense.</i>

120
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,375
What sort of strategy?

121
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,000
<i>Calm down, Ali.</i>

122
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,000
<i>Your neural readings are off the charts.</i>

123
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,458
<i>Ali, the suit's integrity
is dropping below 50%.</i>

124
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,541
I did it!

125
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:13,791
Ouch.

126
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:27,833
He still needs to get used to it.

127
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,666
But I believe the SATRIA project

128
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,916
will breathe new life into MATA.

129
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,333
It's clear he's not ready yet.

130
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,833
I need to see more developments

131
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,125
before this project can be approved.

132
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,833
That was a close one, Comot.

133
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,291
I really thought I was going to fail.

134
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,000
Do you think

135
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,291
I need more data to sync with?

136
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,000
Can I really be SATRIA?

137
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:23,041
Oh, come on. You just ate!

138
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,958
I'll feed you later.
I have to prepare for training tomorrow.

139
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:27,833
Here, play with this.

140
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,666
It's the IRIS agent!

141
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,416
Bulat, do you know where Ali is?

142
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,000
In there.

143
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:16,541
What's that?

144
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,916
Ouch.

145
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:23,666
Are you okay?

146
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,625
What are you doing here?
You never come over.

147
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,000
Why? Can't I?

148
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,875
Just taking a stroll, checking on Comot.

149
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,750
You're really not going
on missions anymore?

150
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,541
I thought you wanted to be a Super Agent.

151
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,708
You'll see once I'm done with training.

152
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,416
SATRIA training?

153
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:49,625
Mind your own business!
Just don't tell anyone.

154
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:50,666
Fine.

155
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:54,958
Ali.

156
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,041
Yeah?

157
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:59,375
Actually, I wanted to ask you something.

158
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:00,666
What is it?

159
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,958
When you were using IRIS,

160
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,875
did you

161
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:06,833
get headaches?

162
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,291
No?

163
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,083
You never felt

164
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:12,541
like fainting?

165
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,416
And...

166
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,583
Of course, using IRIS does drain
a lot of your energy.

167
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:21,208
Now you see, you think
it's easy working with IRIS?

168
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:24,166
It's not that. I mean...

169
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,541
<i>Hey, Ali. Are we on for this thing?</i>

170
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:29,875
<i>I'm about to head out!</i>

171
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,500
Okay, we're on.

172
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,166
I forgot about
the study group with Viktor.

173
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,583
Don't worry about IRIS.

174
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,083
I think you just need more practice.

175
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:42,416
Got to go, bye!

176
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,583
Come on, Comot.

177
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,000
Look at me!

178
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,458
- Am I awesome or what?
- My turn!

179
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,083
Hey, come on, guys. I need to go home.

180
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,250
We're not done yet.

181
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,500
Didn't your folks teach you to share?

182
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:07,833
Hey, Ali!

183
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,166
He's really asking for it!

184
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:19,583
Okay then.

185
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,083
There he is!

186
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:29,458
When he comes out, we'll get him.

187
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,291
Run.

188
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,250
Don't look back!

189
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,041
What are you doing here, Agent Rizwan?

190
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:19,791
MATA has been looking for you.

191
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:22,541
We still have work to do, Ali.

192
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,750
All of the Numeros's threats,

193
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,416
Uno, Cinco.

194
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,333
They were never acting alone.

195
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,875
Someone has been orchestrating everything.

196
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:32,416
Who?

197
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,916
Cero.

198
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,666
I'm still trying to identify him.

199
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:40,333
You must help me get
the mission reports from MATA.

200
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,166
No way.

201
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,333
All intel from MATA is top secret.

202
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,708
I knew it. I told you he'd chicken out.

203
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,583
Ali, as long as they're around,

204
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,541
Cyberaya is in danger.

205
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,125
I'm sorry, Agent Rizwan.

206
00:17:58,208 --> 00:17:59,250
I can't.

207
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,083
It's okay.

208
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,916
If you ever need me, I'll be there.

209
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:11,750
And Ali.

210
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,250
I'm not an agent anymore.

211
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,291
Viktor, you're early...

212
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:24,750
Sasi?

213
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:27,291
He said he wanted to study with us.

214
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,958
Yeah, it's almost the finals!

215
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,000
I can't lose to him again.

216
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,291
And you, you're getting smarter now too.

217
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,416
I want to see how you guys study.

218
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,125
What's your secret?

219
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:43,291
Come on, let's get started!
What are we waiting for?

220
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,625
If you want to know our secret,

221
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:54,458
before we study, we need to warm up first.

222
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:57,083
To increase our brainpower!

223
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,875
That's right, then we can focus better.

224
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:03,041
Wait, we can't be playing games.

225
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:06,583
It's the finals
and you're here wasting time?

226
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,333
{\an8}Behind you!

227
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,041
Don't let him get away!

228
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,541
- Nice!
- Nice!

229
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:16,916
{\an8}How much longer?

230
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,208
Wait, last round!

231
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,666
Do you want to try?
We'll study as soon as we're done, okay?

232
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,375
It won't take long.

233
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:25,625
How do I do this?

234
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,791
You just punch.

235
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,791
Like this?

236
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:40,333
I'm on your team.

237
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:43,791
Okay, one more round.

238
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,541
Don't you want to go home?

239
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,708
Oh no, it's so late!

240
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,000
Studying with you guys was awesome.

241
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,625
We should do this again sometime!

242
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,625
Oh man, it's going to rain.

243
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,750
What have we done?

244
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,708
We didn't even study.

245
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:08,708
Here, I took down some notes just now.

246
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,583
- Nice!
- See you.

247
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,583
<i>The power supply disruption that occurred</i>

248
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:27,166
<i>early this morning in Wawasan Bay
and multiple technology centers</i>

249
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,333
<i>has been restored
without any complications.</i>

250
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,458
<i>The official report of the investigation
determined that</i>

251
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,041
<i>it was caused by an unusual</i>

252
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:37,833
<i>elemental change in the ocean currents.</i>

253
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,333
The weather is really acting up.

254
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,625
<i>Energy supply is now fully operational</i>

255
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:48,750
<i>- and stable.</i>
- Comot.

256
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:52,250
- Get off the remote.
- No prolonged disruption is expected.

257
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,916
<i>According to
the official statement from Cyber...</i>

258
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,833
<i>Civilians and establishments
that were affected</i>

259
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:01,083
<i>express their gratitude...</i>

260
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:06,333
<i>On a lighter note, let's tune in to...</i>

261
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:33,708
<i>Ali!</i>

262
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,166
<i>Remember me?</i>

263
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:38,458
Neonimus!

264
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:41,833
<i>What's up?</i>

265
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,083
<i>No more missions?</i>

266
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:44,750
<i>Are you suspended again?</i>

267
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,208
How are you doing this--

268
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,458
<i>Come on, like you're not used to this.</i>

269
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,375
<i>Let's play a game!</i>

270
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,291
<i>I've created a level.</i>

271
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:54,750
<i>Especially for you.</i>

272
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,625
<i>Yeah, let me try this.</i>

273
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,250
<i>Our intel states that</i>

274
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:05,583
<i>Neonimus will launch his greatest attack</i>

275
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:07,916
{\an8}<i>at the following location tonight.</i>

276
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,208
{\an8}<i>Your mission is to complete</i>

277
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:14,958
{\an8}<i>the most thrilling level
before time runs out.</i>

278
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,541
<i>If you fail,</i>

279
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:19,250
<i>the entrance and exit will be sealed.</i>

280
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,041
<i>Act immediately!</i>

281
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:22,666
<i>So, how'd I do?</i>

282
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,791
You... Why would I play your dirty game?

283
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:29,458
<i>I knew you'd play hard to get.</i>

284
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:32,333
<i>That's fine,
but if you decide not to play,</i>

285
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:37,291
<i>I will reveal the identity
of all of MATA's agents!</i>

286
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:53,458
<i>You should come, I'll be waiting.</i>

287
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:54,750
<i>Don't be late.</i>

288
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:17,416
- This is--
- Cyberaya Smart Tunnel.

289
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:21,125
That's a very strategic target,

290
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:23,166
especially with the weather lately.

291
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,125
This could spell disaster.

292
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:27,875
Maybe there's nothing
to worry about. Look.

293
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:32,916
Even though Neonimus is quite
the cunning hacker,

294
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,750
he's not as dangerous as he seems.

295
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:38,541
He threatened to blow up
the MATA base, but didn't.

296
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,833
He threatened to crash
the trains, but didn't.

297
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:45,041
In short, he's just all talk.

298
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,666
This is not a high-level threat.

299
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:51,916
I agree, send out the young agents, okay?

300
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,333
Act immediately.

301
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,250
Wait.

302
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:59,833
Since Ali has had some experience dealing
with Neonimus in the past,

303
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:03,208
this might be the right time
for us to test out SATRIA?

304
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:07,041
- SATRIA? What is--
- SATRIA has not yet been approved.

305
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:10,041
That is why we need results
from an actual mission.

306
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:11,625
Are you certain?

307
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:14,583
If anything happens,
you'll assume all responsibility?

308
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,791
In case you haven't noticed,

309
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,666
Dato's patience has been running thin

310
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,958
since you failed with IRIS NEO.

311
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:29,666
Fine.

312
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,625
We'll send a support team.

313
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,750
Ali!

314
00:24:42,791 --> 00:24:45,083
It's been a while since
our last mission together.

315
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:47,458
Can't believe we get to do this again.

316
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:50,000
I can't believe
I still have to babysit you.

317
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:52,291
Why you...

318
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:53,291
Ali.

319
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,666
This is your chance to prove

320
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,041
your capabilities as the SATRIA Agent.

321
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:07,125
Good luck.

322
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:09,416
- Understood.
- Do your best.

323
00:25:10,083 --> 00:25:11,166
And don't mess up!

324
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:13,625
Ganz.

325
00:25:13,708 --> 00:25:14,666
Go ahead.

326
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:31,500
SATRIA. Rise.

327
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:52,083
Ready.

328
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:53,875
Cool.

329
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,208
I'm dead!

330
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:11,083
I've got to split before he...

331
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:14,416
Take this!

332
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,958
You think you can escape?

333
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:20,833
I'm not going anywhere, I'm right here.

334
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:23,708
I gave you a golden opportunity.

335
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:25,916
Not only did you fail,

336
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:28,458
but you're also trying to betray me!

337
00:26:28,541 --> 00:26:29,833
Betray you?

338
00:26:29,916 --> 00:26:30,750
No!

339
00:26:30,833 --> 00:26:32,666
Pirate scum.

340
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,791
What did you tell them?

341
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:38,833
Nothing, I didn't say anything, I swear!

342
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:41,000
Fine.

343
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:42,541
But now,

344
00:26:42,625 --> 00:26:46,000
it's time to erase all traces.

345
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:48,708
Have mercy, Cero...

346
00:26:48,791 --> 00:26:50,208
I don't want to die single.

347
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:53,625
Cero. I knew it.

348
00:26:57,708 --> 00:26:58,541
Too easy.

349
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,250
You...

350
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:02,666
You tricked me.

351
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,500
So noisy.

352
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,000
Your kid's got a mission.

353
00:27:12,416 --> 00:27:14,833
CAUTION, SPEED TRAP

354
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,916
<i>You brought backup, I see?</i>

355
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,583
<i>I'm going to have
to set up multiplayer then.</i>

356
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:27,791
<i>The game is simple.</i>

357
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:30,416
<i>If you can make it
to the end of the tunnel,</i>

358
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,625
<i>you guys win.</i>

359
00:27:31,708 --> 00:27:34,708
<i>If not, you'll see.</i>

360
00:27:34,791 --> 00:27:35,958
Watch out!

361
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:46,166
Don't let him get away!

362
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,666
Let's go, SATRIA!

363
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:55,000
Are you okay, ma'am?

364
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,708
He's using this to hack
into the cars' systems.

365
00:27:59,416 --> 00:28:01,333
SATRIA, can you trace
the source of the signal?

366
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:04,375
<i>- Yes, hold on.</i>
- Okay.

367
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:06,125
What's that?

368
00:28:11,041 --> 00:28:12,416
Don't let them get to the others.

369
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,333
<i>- Ali, Neonimus's location--</i>
- Wait.

370
00:28:15,416 --> 00:28:17,041
People are in danger here.

371
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,625
Show-off.

372
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:48,791
Too slow.

373
00:28:51,041 --> 00:28:54,041
<i>Ali, we need to find Neonimus quickly.</i>

374
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:55,625
<i>Now is not the time to play around.</i>

375
00:28:55,708 --> 00:28:58,083
I'm not playing, it's Alicia!

376
00:29:00,416 --> 00:29:01,666
Too slow!

377
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,083
Seems like we'll wrap up in no time.

378
00:29:03,166 --> 00:29:04,333
So, what shall we eat next, Comot?

379
00:29:04,416 --> 00:29:06,583
<i>Having fun?</i>

380
00:29:06,666 --> 00:29:09,416
<i>Let's see if you can handle this.</i>

381
00:29:28,041 --> 00:29:28,958
Is everyone okay?

382
00:29:33,625 --> 00:29:34,791
Get off.

383
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:35,875
Get off here.

384
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,666
Right here. Watch your step, ma'am.

385
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:43,416
Move.

386
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:05,875
SATRIA, dial it down a little.
There are civilians here.

387
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:09,583
No!

388
00:30:13,708 --> 00:30:15,375
Help me!

389
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:18,708
Go, Ali!

390
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:19,875
We'll handle this.

391
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:42,583
<i>One little spider</i>

392
00:30:42,666 --> 00:30:44,750
<i>Got Ali in its web</i>

393
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,250
Neonimus?

394
00:30:51,875 --> 00:30:53,666
You're just a kid?

395
00:30:54,666 --> 00:30:57,125
Why? Is that so hard to believe?

396
00:30:57,208 --> 00:31:00,333
It's just like when people
find out you're an agent.

397
00:31:00,416 --> 00:31:02,750
If it weren't for you,

398
00:31:02,833 --> 00:31:05,458
I'd be a young agent too!

399
00:31:05,541 --> 00:31:06,625
What do you mean?

400
00:31:06,708 --> 00:31:08,458
You stole my spot!

401
00:31:08,541 --> 00:31:10,416
They threw me out of the academy

402
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,333
to make space for you!

403
00:31:12,416 --> 00:31:16,291
So, I need to show them that
they've chosen the wrong person.

404
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:18,708
Unfortunately,

405
00:31:18,791 --> 00:31:21,000
I must scout for a new player.

406
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:22,583
Because now,

407
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:25,000
it's game over for you.

408
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:34,333
Hey!

409
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:38,875
You are all a bunch of cheaters!

410
00:31:38,958 --> 00:31:41,583
Fine, two can play that game!

411
00:31:52,416 --> 00:31:54,125
<i>When the water crashes</i>

412
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:56,208
<i>The spider runs away</i>

413
00:32:18,791 --> 00:32:19,958
Yeah, you'd better run.

414
00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:22,333
<i>Agent Bakar, we need to move now!</i>

415
00:32:22,416 --> 00:32:23,250
Why?

416
00:32:27,291 --> 00:32:29,000
Hurry!

417
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:30,791
Let's get out of here!

418
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:37,375
Darn.

419
00:32:57,666 --> 00:32:59,166
Nice job, Alicia!

420
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:00,791
Alicia?

421
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:10,000
Don't run away!

422
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:14,125
<i>Alicia, wake up!</i>

423
00:33:14,666 --> 00:33:16,583
<i>Ali, focus on the objective.</i>

424
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,625
Nice job, Ali.

425
00:33:50,708 --> 00:33:51,541
Let's go.

426
00:33:59,625 --> 00:34:00,458
All set.

427
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:03,916
Hurry. We've got to move
before MATA's cleanup crew arrives.

428
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,041
Wait.

429
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:06,166
Grab one of those things.

430
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:11,083
Just one?

431
00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:12,666
Why not a knapsack full?

432
00:34:13,458 --> 00:34:15,083
What year were you born?

433
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,416
Alicia, are you all right?

434
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:26,666
What happened?

435
00:34:28,625 --> 00:34:29,666
The mission.

436
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,916
Everyone's safe.

437
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:36,583
But

438
00:34:36,666 --> 00:34:38,708
Neonimus got away.

439
00:34:38,791 --> 00:34:39,916
So,

440
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,041
it's not looking good for Project SATRIA.

441
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:46,416
Ali was supposed to pull it off.

442
00:34:49,958 --> 00:34:52,708
Is there anything you want to tell me?

443
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:54,875
No.

444
00:34:55,958 --> 00:34:56,875
I'm late.

445
00:34:58,375 --> 00:35:00,541
- Alicia, you should be resting.
- General.

446
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:03,416
Well?

447
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,041
From my analysis of the recording,

448
00:35:05,125 --> 00:35:07,125
she's proven to be more efficient

449
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:08,916
and performs far better than Ali.

450
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,833
It's just that I found

451
00:35:11,916 --> 00:35:14,500
some glitches in IRIS's functions.

452
00:35:23,708 --> 00:35:24,875
Stand up!

453
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,208
- Good morning, Mrs. Munah!
- Good morning, Mrs. Munah!

454
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:29,291
Morning.

455
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:30,291
All right.

456
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:34,250
I will now share the results
of your trial exam.

457
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,333
- First place.
- Please.

458
00:35:37,416 --> 00:35:38,958
As usual,

459
00:35:39,041 --> 00:35:40,125
Alicia!

460
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:53,083
Where is Alicia?

461
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:56,583
She... Alicia...

462
00:35:56,666 --> 00:35:58,000
- She has...
- Present, Mrs. Munah.

463
00:36:00,833 --> 00:36:01,666
I apologize.

464
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,416
I got caught up with prefect duties.

465
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,500
Just because you're the top student

466
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:07,541
doesn't mean you can skip classes.

467
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:09,541
It's not a good sign.
You might just fail your exam.

468
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:11,416
Second place.

469
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:13,291
Viktor!

470
00:36:13,375 --> 00:36:15,083
No!

471
00:36:22,625 --> 00:36:23,666
Thank you.

472
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:29,958
Ali, wait.

473
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:34,916
Do you want some?

474
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:37,916
How are you doing with SATRIA now?

475
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:40,000
I don't know.

476
00:36:40,083 --> 00:36:42,916
I heard they were discussing
going fully automated.

477
00:36:43,458 --> 00:36:44,666
Or they might change agents.

478
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,666
If that's true, then I really won't
be able to go on missions anymore.

479
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,958
I'm sorry, Ali.

480
00:36:52,041 --> 00:36:53,083
If it weren't for me...

481
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:54,708
It's fine.

482
00:36:54,791 --> 00:36:56,041
Are you okay?

483
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:57,500
Why did you pass out?

484
00:36:57,583 --> 00:36:59,083
Actually,

485
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:00,750
that's what I've been trying to tell you.

486
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:03,083
When I'm using IRIS,

487
00:37:03,708 --> 00:37:05,625
it's like I can see things...

488
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:07,750
that haven't happened yet.

489
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:11,958
That's IRIS's function, it gives you
the computer's perception.

490
00:37:13,125 --> 00:37:14,916
I know that.

491
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,458
I mean like,

492
00:37:16,541 --> 00:37:19,083
I can see the future.

493
00:37:25,666 --> 00:37:27,500
And in the tunnel,

494
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:29,666
how did you think I knew
you were in danger?

495
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:31,625
You mean,

496
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:33,833
you're like a psychic?

497
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,333
That's so cool!

498
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:40,750
I thought so at first,

499
00:37:40,833 --> 00:37:43,125
but after a while, it got worse.

500
00:37:44,833 --> 00:37:47,750
Or maybe you're just too high-strung?

501
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:49,625
- Excuse me?
- I mean...

502
00:37:49,708 --> 00:37:51,625
You're too serious all the time,

503
00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:53,208
and your brain controls IRIS.

504
00:37:53,291 --> 00:37:56,041
Maybe the computer's all scrambled
because you're using your brain too much.

505
00:37:56,125 --> 00:37:57,958
You're the one
not using your brain enough.

506
00:38:00,375 --> 00:38:01,208
Why you...

507
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,791
Oh man, I forgot again. Study group!

508
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:12,541
Ali!

509
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:15,041
Alicia, what are you doing here?

510
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:18,666
We are...

511
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,666
Studying, what else?

512
00:38:24,791 --> 00:38:26,458
That's interesting.

513
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,333
What's interesting?

514
00:38:30,416 --> 00:38:32,291
We're playing two v two, right?

515
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,833
No!

516
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,958
Wait, then.

517
00:38:37,041 --> 00:38:38,625
She's really joining our study group?

518
00:38:38,708 --> 00:38:40,833
You want to know our secret?

519
00:38:40,916 --> 00:38:42,458
Before studying,

520
00:38:42,541 --> 00:38:44,250
we need to warm up first.

521
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:46,416
To increase--

522
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,666
No need for that.

523
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:50,208
How about we skip the game today?

524
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:51,125
Why?

525
00:38:51,208 --> 00:38:53,541
You guys think I can't chill out?

526
00:39:00,291 --> 00:39:01,333
Right there!

527
00:39:04,291 --> 00:39:07,250
Full charge, do the special attack!

528
00:39:10,708 --> 00:39:11,833
Yes!

529
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:13,750
I beat Alicia at last.

530
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:15,250
It's just a game, man.

531
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:16,500
Oh man, Alicia.

532
00:39:16,583 --> 00:39:18,708
- You should've used the special attack.
- Jeez.

533
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:28,458
Can you show me again, Ali. Please?

534
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:31,041
Do this to attack,

535
00:39:31,125 --> 00:39:32,791
and this for the special attack.

536
00:39:33,541 --> 00:39:35,458
You should loosen up a bit.

537
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:37,333
You're too stiff.

538
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,333
Okay, again.

539
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:22,541
Nice!

540
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,416
GG.

541
00:40:25,125 --> 00:40:27,125
EZ.

542
00:40:31,166 --> 00:40:33,250
I don't want to study
with you guys anymore.

543
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:34,375
Hey, Sasi!

544
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:36,166
You said you wanted a ride later?

545
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:40,250
So, are we studying or what?

546
00:42:19,541 --> 00:42:23,083
HAPPY BURGER, CHICKEN SPECIAL

547
00:42:26,333 --> 00:42:27,625
What's on your mind?

548
00:42:27,708 --> 00:42:30,416
I'm beginning to see his game.

549
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,333
Look.

550
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:33,666
The people chosen by Cero

551
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:37,208
all have their own motives
to antagonize Cyberaya.

552
00:42:37,291 --> 00:42:39,000
From there, he will seize the opportunity

553
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:42,625
and incite them to carry out his plans.

554
00:42:43,416 --> 00:42:46,291
Now, we just have to find out
who his next target will be.

555
00:42:48,208 --> 00:42:49,291
How is Ali?

556
00:42:49,875 --> 00:42:51,625
Your kid's got a new toy.

557
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:58,333
Neonimus.

558
00:43:00,041 --> 00:43:01,833
He has upped his game.

559
00:43:03,625 --> 00:43:04,833
Rizwan!

560
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:06,458
You've got to see this.

561
00:43:06,541 --> 00:43:08,500
I was tracking the signal to this thing.

562
00:43:10,458 --> 00:43:12,041
Then it brought up all these locations.

563
00:43:14,041 --> 00:43:16,000
This one. Does that look familiar?

564
00:43:17,875 --> 00:43:19,083
Wait, isn't that...

565
00:43:21,208 --> 00:43:22,041
Let's move.

566
00:43:23,583 --> 00:43:24,416
See you.

567
00:43:32,958 --> 00:43:35,333
Thanks, I had fun today.

568
00:43:36,375 --> 00:43:38,000
- Really?
- Yeah.

569
00:43:38,083 --> 00:43:40,500
I think even my headache is easing up.

570
00:43:41,416 --> 00:43:44,291
So, I was right, you are too high-strung.

571
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,958
No, I'm just kidding.

572
00:43:48,666 --> 00:43:50,375
Are we studying again tomorrow?

573
00:43:51,458 --> 00:43:54,041
No, I have training tomorrow.

574
00:43:54,125 --> 00:43:57,208
I need to increase my sync levels
in order to keep going on with SATRIA.

575
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,833
How come your Neuro sync level is so low?

576
00:44:00,916 --> 00:44:02,083
I don't know.

577
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:04,416
Follow me.

578
00:44:08,291 --> 00:44:10,500
What are we playing chess for?

579
00:44:10,583 --> 00:44:13,208
A Neuro Agent must be able to think ahead

580
00:44:13,291 --> 00:44:14,666
while on a mission.

581
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:17,250
Playing chess can help train
your ability to predict.

582
00:44:20,541 --> 00:44:22,708
<i>Don't simply track the enemy's movements.</i>

583
00:44:22,791 --> 00:44:24,583
<i>Anticipate where they're going.</i>

584
00:44:27,916 --> 00:44:29,583
Now that you no longer have IRIS,

585
00:44:29,666 --> 00:44:31,500
you need to read
the fight patterns yourself.

586
00:44:40,166 --> 00:44:42,875
A Neuro Agent must have a strong memory.

587
00:44:45,708 --> 00:44:46,666
Order?

588
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:49,000
Fried noodles, hold the spice.

589
00:44:49,083 --> 00:44:50,583
Two, but with an egg!

590
00:44:50,666 --> 00:44:52,500
I'd like a spicy one, no veggies.

591
00:44:53,333 --> 00:44:55,375
Ditto, but make mine rice noodles.

592
00:44:55,458 --> 00:44:57,583
Also, an iced black tea,
make it less sweet!

593
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:09,291
Oh man!

594
00:45:11,791 --> 00:45:13,083
<i>Don't hesitate.</i>

595
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,500
<i>Good, again!</i>

596
00:45:53,666 --> 00:45:56,000
Boss, two special roti, please!

597
00:45:57,333 --> 00:45:59,250
- Iced tea in a big glass!
- Done!

598
00:46:15,083 --> 00:46:16,791
Now you've got it.

599
00:46:23,083 --> 00:46:25,666
You've really never had these before?

600
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:26,875
No.

601
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:29,041
I don't eat junk food like you.

602
00:46:29,708 --> 00:46:30,958
Talk about discipline,

603
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:32,875
no wonder you're awesome
even without IRIS.

604
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,583
You're not so bad yourself.

605
00:46:36,666 --> 00:46:38,958
You've got instincts and spirit.

606
00:46:39,041 --> 00:46:41,291
And you don't even train much.

607
00:46:42,416 --> 00:46:43,791
It's so unfair.

608
00:46:49,208 --> 00:46:52,000
<i>Look at you two, having fun?</i>

609
00:46:55,875 --> 00:46:56,708
What?

610
00:46:56,791 --> 00:46:58,541
Can't I go with them?

611
00:46:58,625 --> 00:47:01,500
It is not my decision.

612
00:47:01,583 --> 00:47:03,666
- But...
- You shouldn't be here!

613
00:47:04,916 --> 00:47:06,166
Everyone's ready?

614
00:47:13,458 --> 00:47:14,750
Entrance, clear.

615
00:47:23,375 --> 00:47:25,458
Main stage, clear.

616
00:47:27,333 --> 00:47:28,875
Control room, clear.

617
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:32,333
Jero mascot, clear.

618
00:47:33,583 --> 00:47:34,916
Food plaza, clear.

619
00:47:36,125 --> 00:47:38,500
Hello, are you open or not?

620
00:47:39,875 --> 00:47:42,375
Right. Agents, stay vigilant.

621
00:47:42,458 --> 00:47:44,583
Amir, what were you thinking?

622
00:47:44,666 --> 00:47:46,541
Why did you send out so many agents?

623
00:47:46,625 --> 00:47:48,583
We can't take any risks.

624
00:47:48,666 --> 00:47:51,458
What's more, after the recent
smart tunnel incident.

625
00:47:52,083 --> 00:47:54,375
From SATRIA's mission recording,

626
00:47:54,458 --> 00:47:57,333
I've managed to uncover
Neonimus's identity.

627
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:58,166
What?

628
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:01,291
- When did you...
- I think you know him better than we do.

629
00:48:03,041 --> 00:48:04,291
It can't be.

630
00:48:04,375 --> 00:48:05,583
Who's the kid?

631
00:48:05,666 --> 00:48:07,708
He was recruited as a young agent.

632
00:48:07,791 --> 00:48:09,958
But he was expelled from the academy

633
00:48:10,041 --> 00:48:11,708
due to behavioral issues.

634
00:48:11,791 --> 00:48:13,666
Shouldn't he be following
MATA's procedures?

635
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:17,000
Yes, but he managed to sabotage the system

636
00:48:17,083 --> 00:48:18,291
before disappearing.

637
00:48:24,166 --> 00:48:25,250
Voilà!

638
00:48:29,125 --> 00:48:30,250
Are you kidding?

639
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:31,541
This doesn't even look like the picture!

640
00:48:31,625 --> 00:48:33,541
Just eat the picture then!

641
00:48:34,166 --> 00:48:36,375
- Chill, bro.
- What's going on here?

642
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:39,500
Are you here to work or goof around?

643
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,083
We're undercover.

644
00:48:41,166 --> 00:48:43,458
So we're supposed to play the part.

645
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:46,125
Are you for real, Alicia?

646
00:48:46,208 --> 00:48:47,291
What?

647
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:48,791
Am I wrong?

648
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:53,291
If you like it so much,
go ahead and do it.

649
00:48:53,375 --> 00:48:54,333
No way,

650
00:48:54,416 --> 00:48:55,958
we were assigned to survey the area.

651
00:48:56,875 --> 00:48:58,416
Yeah, let's go!

652
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,000
Hey, come back here!

653
00:49:00,083 --> 00:49:01,083
I want to go too!

654
00:49:17,333 --> 00:49:19,416
I bet Ali's not tall enough for this ride!

655
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,500
Touché!

656
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:22,583
The show's starting!

657
00:49:22,666 --> 00:49:25,333
We'll reconvene here later.
Act immediately!

658
00:49:48,083 --> 00:49:50,541
DETECTIVE JEBAT - WRATH OF EVIL

659
00:50:00,708 --> 00:50:02,666
<i>So, Agent Alicia has entered the game.</i>

660
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:05,958
<i>Looks like you've found my special level.</i>

661
00:50:07,916 --> 00:50:09,208
Let's go, Cadet!

662
00:50:09,291 --> 00:50:12,458
We need to take out the Terrible Three
before they rise in power

663
00:50:12,541 --> 00:50:14,625
and attack our town!

664
00:51:18,541 --> 00:51:19,833
Get off now!

665
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,208
Zass, get him out!

666
00:52:29,958 --> 00:52:32,291
Team, come in, I need backup!

667
00:52:42,583 --> 00:52:44,666
You think you can skip ahead
without playing?

668
00:52:48,541 --> 00:52:51,458
AGENT ALICIA

669
00:52:54,625 --> 00:52:55,791
Alicia.

670
00:52:56,458 --> 00:52:58,125
Send backup!

671
00:52:59,166 --> 00:53:00,541
Pull out the agents from other missions.

672
00:53:00,625 --> 00:53:02,208
We don't have enough intel!

673
00:53:02,291 --> 00:53:03,666
Don't repeat the same mistake.

674
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:05,875
- So we'll use drones.
- And if they get hacked?

675
00:53:05,958 --> 00:53:07,333
Let's send SATRIA.

676
00:53:07,416 --> 00:53:09,375
Ali has shown improvements in training...

677
00:53:09,458 --> 00:53:12,791
Now isn't the right time
to showcase your pet project.

678
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:13,708
But she's right!

679
00:53:13,791 --> 00:53:16,083
I am getting better at handling SATRIA!

680
00:53:18,208 --> 00:53:19,166
What is he doing here?

681
00:53:20,541 --> 00:53:23,333
I commanded you to stay out!

682
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:31,541
Send me.

683
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:34,125
General, we need you here to...

684
00:53:34,208 --> 00:53:36,208
Just try and stop me.

685
00:53:51,166 --> 00:53:52,416
Formation!

686
00:54:04,166 --> 00:54:06,333
Who's messing with our Icha?

687
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,791
Act immediately!

688
00:54:42,916 --> 00:54:43,916
Alicia!

689
00:54:45,208 --> 00:54:46,750
You finally made it!

690
00:54:46,833 --> 00:54:48,583
Now we can have some fun!

691
00:54:48,666 --> 00:54:49,916
Let her go!

692
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:50,875
Sure.

693
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:53,541
You just have to clear this level first!

694
00:55:03,291 --> 00:55:04,625
Why are they still moving?

695
00:55:04,708 --> 00:55:07,041
<i>They were repaired by those spider robots.</i>

696
00:55:10,791 --> 00:55:13,125
SATRIA, increase attack power.

697
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:49,583
Got you now!

698
00:55:57,833 --> 00:55:58,875
Icha!

699
00:56:00,583 --> 00:56:02,166
Where do you think you're going?

700
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:06,750
You win!

701
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,500
You wanted to play so bad?

702
00:56:12,708 --> 00:56:14,875
Ali. Don't.

703
00:56:15,625 --> 00:56:17,833
Please don't kill me.

704
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,458
I'm just following orders!

705
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:28,250
Ali, enough!

706
00:56:38,958 --> 00:56:39,791
Amir.

707
00:56:43,375 --> 00:56:44,208
Amir!

708
00:56:46,708 --> 00:56:48,625
It's time to step in.

709
00:56:48,708 --> 00:56:50,375
Don't be hasty.

710
00:56:50,458 --> 00:56:52,958
Fallen agents can be replaced.

711
00:56:53,041 --> 00:56:56,833
But if we fall, it's the end for MATA!

712
00:56:56,916 --> 00:56:57,875
And SATRIA?

713
00:56:57,958 --> 00:57:00,333
Are we going to let it fall
into the enemy's hands?

714
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:02,166
That wouldn't have been a problem

715
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:04,291
if you'd gotten rid of the pilot

716
00:57:04,375 --> 00:57:06,000
like we suggested.

717
00:57:06,083 --> 00:57:07,166
You see.

718
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:10,208
If you're not capable of controlling
your own subordinates,

719
00:57:10,291 --> 00:57:11,791
what's the point in being a Pillar Leader?

720
00:57:11,875 --> 00:57:13,541
Watch your mouth.

721
00:57:15,416 --> 00:57:16,291
Dato'.

722
00:57:16,375 --> 00:57:18,791
My phone won't stop ringing.

723
00:57:18,875 --> 00:57:21,333
The media's been chasing me
left and right.

724
00:57:21,416 --> 00:57:22,416
Look!

725
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:25,208
The people out there are panicking!

726
00:57:25,291 --> 00:57:28,166
What have you been doing?

727
00:57:28,791 --> 00:57:30,583
We have...

728
00:57:30,666 --> 00:57:32,583
We've lost five teams.

729
00:57:33,166 --> 00:57:35,833
General Rama has gone rogue

730
00:57:35,916 --> 00:57:37,416
with Ali and SATRIA.

731
00:57:38,041 --> 00:57:39,500
What's their status?

732
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:42,208
We're still not able to reach them.

733
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,625
- Why are you all so use--
- General?

734
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,291
What?

735
00:57:56,708 --> 00:57:59,125
Is that SATRIA, the secret project?

736
00:57:59,208 --> 00:58:00,875
I heard he single-handedly
saved everybody.

737
00:58:00,958 --> 00:58:02,791
Really? That's amazing!

738
00:58:10,333 --> 00:58:11,625
Agent Dayang!

739
00:58:11,708 --> 00:58:12,583
Congratulations, Ali.

740
00:58:13,333 --> 00:58:14,791
You did it.

741
00:58:37,708 --> 00:58:40,833
This is for your own good.

742
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:50,291
Can you believe it, Comot?

743
00:58:50,875 --> 00:58:52,416
Me.

744
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,375
The SATRIA Agent.

745
00:58:54,958 --> 00:58:57,416
Ali, can we talk?

746
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:58,416
Alicia!

747
00:58:58,500 --> 00:58:59,541
You're okay?

748
00:59:00,291 --> 00:59:02,541
- I guess.
- That was some mission!

749
00:59:02,625 --> 00:59:04,125
Did you see me just now?

750
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:05,875
You didn't, huh?

751
00:59:05,958 --> 00:59:08,458
Right. You were knocked out.

752
00:59:09,041 --> 00:59:10,875
But if you had seen me in action...

753
00:59:10,958 --> 00:59:13,416
- Wait, maybe IRIS recorded it.
- Ali!

754
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:14,875
I need to tell you something!

755
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,916
I saw

756
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,500
something with IRIS.

757
00:59:23,166 --> 00:59:25,166
Rot in here for all we care!

758
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:26,833
Agent Dayang!

759
00:59:27,958 --> 00:59:28,875
I...

760
00:59:29,416 --> 00:59:31,083
I want to speak to Agent Dayang.

761
00:59:35,625 --> 00:59:37,125
{\an8}Are you sure about this?

762
00:59:37,666 --> 00:59:39,583
{\an8}I'm just following the signal.

763
00:59:42,833 --> 00:59:43,833
Look around.

764
00:59:43,916 --> 00:59:45,833
See if you can find a hidden space.

765
01:00:00,916 --> 01:00:03,083
We were here with Uno for years.

766
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:05,208
I would've known if there were...

767
01:00:28,916 --> 01:00:31,750
DETECTIVE JEBAT

768
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:34,375
DETECTIVE JEBAT

769
01:00:43,541 --> 01:00:44,625
What's wrong?

770
01:00:47,416 --> 01:00:49,000
Are you in danger?

771
01:00:54,416 --> 01:00:55,750
No.

772
01:00:55,833 --> 01:00:57,583
MATA's the one in danger.

773
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,541
<i>All this time, my revenge was
just child's play to you.</i>

774
01:01:04,166 --> 01:01:06,375
<i>You have been underestimating me.</i>

775
01:01:07,583 --> 01:01:11,041
<i>Because I was never good enough
to join your team.</i>

776
01:01:12,583 --> 01:01:15,166
<i>But this time around,
I'm no longer playing alone.</i>

777
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:18,250
<i>I've found myself a powerful teammate!</i>

778
01:01:19,875 --> 01:01:22,666
You will regret the day you threw me out!

779
01:01:23,291 --> 01:01:24,833
What have you done?

780
01:01:24,916 --> 01:01:26,875
You'll see for yourself.

781
01:01:29,625 --> 01:01:31,666
By the way, Cero sends his regards.

782
01:01:39,875 --> 01:01:41,583
He knows we're here.

783
01:01:57,916 --> 01:01:59,125
What?

784
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:01,000
SATRIA?

785
01:02:01,666 --> 01:02:02,916
Causing destruction?

786
01:02:03,875 --> 01:02:05,166
Are you serious?

787
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:06,958
I'm not so sure myself.

788
01:02:07,791 --> 01:02:09,750
But it looks really bad, Ali.

789
01:02:10,375 --> 01:02:12,208
Or maybe what you saw was
just me on a mission?

790
01:02:12,291 --> 01:02:14,291
I don't think so

791
01:02:14,375 --> 01:02:16,875
because everything was wrecked.

792
01:02:16,958 --> 01:02:18,833
Nothing was left standing.

793
01:02:19,916 --> 01:02:21,916
<i>Except SATRIA.</i>

794
01:02:25,666 --> 01:02:27,125
When will this happen exactly?

795
01:02:27,708 --> 01:02:29,166
I don't know.

796
01:02:29,708 --> 01:02:31,875
But I've got a bad feeling about it.

797
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:34,750
Maybe we should just tell Agent Dayang.

798
01:02:34,833 --> 01:02:36,500
We need confirmation first.

799
01:02:37,166 --> 01:02:38,666
Can't you use IRIS to see again?

800
01:02:40,166 --> 01:02:42,208
I don't have IRIS right now.

801
01:02:42,291 --> 01:02:43,458
The General took it.

802
01:02:43,541 --> 01:02:45,291
He's giving it back to Agent Dayang.

803
01:02:48,708 --> 01:02:49,791
So that's it.

804
01:02:49,875 --> 01:02:50,750
What?

805
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:52,250
You...

806
01:02:52,333 --> 01:02:54,541
You're trying to take SATRIA away from me.

807
01:02:54,625 --> 01:02:56,541
Because they took IRIS from you?

808
01:02:56,625 --> 01:02:59,666
You think I'm making all this up?

809
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:01,708
It's not like you have any proof.

810
01:03:01,791 --> 01:03:03,333
Am I supposed to just believe you?

811
01:03:03,416 --> 01:03:04,458
Why not?

812
01:03:04,541 --> 01:03:05,958
You believed me before!

813
01:03:06,041 --> 01:03:07,458
I don't know.

814
01:03:07,541 --> 01:03:08,833
Kind of strange that

815
01:03:08,916 --> 01:03:10,625
you have all these visions
just when things are going great for me.

816
01:03:10,708 --> 01:03:13,291
You seriously think I'm jealous of you?

817
01:03:14,333 --> 01:03:16,958
You've always felt that way about me.

818
01:03:17,041 --> 01:03:18,875
Ever since I got IRIS!

819
01:03:21,083 --> 01:03:23,208
You sure are dense!

820
01:03:25,541 --> 01:03:27,750
Whatever, at least I'm okay

821
01:03:27,833 --> 01:03:29,875
with other agents being better than me.

822
01:03:32,333 --> 01:03:34,708
I couldn't care less about IRIS!

823
01:03:34,791 --> 01:03:36,083
I'm not like you.

824
01:03:36,166 --> 01:03:38,541
I don't have to depend on some gadget.
Pathetic!

825
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:41,208
I knew you'd...

826
01:03:42,125 --> 01:03:43,750
- Stop it, Comot!
- Quiet!

827
01:04:04,708 --> 01:04:05,708
Agent Rizwan.

828
01:04:05,791 --> 01:04:06,916
What?

829
01:04:07,916 --> 01:04:10,375
<i>Neonimus. Get him out of there.</i>

830
01:04:11,458 --> 01:04:12,333
Why?

831
01:04:13,291 --> 01:04:14,750
We've been

832
01:04:15,416 --> 01:04:17,458
played right into Cero's plan.

833
01:04:20,166 --> 01:04:21,166
What do we do?

834
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:22,416
Find the General.

835
01:04:26,416 --> 01:04:27,458
What now?

836
01:04:29,291 --> 01:04:30,750
What's going on?

837
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:32,625
All comms are offline.

838
01:04:32,708 --> 01:04:34,500
We need to switch the backup power on.

839
01:04:34,583 --> 01:04:36,500
Ganz, find Dayang, and...

840
01:04:46,541 --> 01:04:48,000
The HQ has been breached.

841
01:04:49,375 --> 01:04:51,500
Initiate the Island Protocol.

842
01:04:55,083 --> 01:04:56,500
You alert them about Neonimus.

843
01:04:56,583 --> 01:04:58,125
I'll go get SATRIA.

844
01:04:58,208 --> 01:04:59,875
Are you serious?

845
01:04:59,958 --> 01:05:01,708
After everything I've told you,

846
01:05:01,791 --> 01:05:03,375
don't you care at all?

847
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,083
I don't have time for all this!

848
01:05:06,166 --> 01:05:07,500
Ali, wait!

849
01:05:46,958 --> 01:05:48,458
SATRIA.

850
01:05:48,541 --> 01:05:49,666
Rise.

851
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:04,083
<i>Ali, something is interfering
with the system.</i>

852
01:06:04,666 --> 01:06:06,916
<i>- Neonimus. He was able to insert--</i>
- I know.

853
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,708
We need to move fast!

854
01:06:10,458 --> 01:06:11,958
He should be in the holding area.

855
01:06:12,041 --> 01:06:15,166
<i>It seems Neonimus has taken over
the droids' control system.</i>

856
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:19,125
<i>We will take more time
if we use alternate routes.</i>

857
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:21,125
Then we won't, just push through.

858
01:06:45,666 --> 01:06:47,916
Since when did MATA droids
fight like this?

859
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,583
<i>It is probably caused
by Neonimus's program.</i>

860
01:07:26,291 --> 01:07:27,750
Oh man.

861
01:07:27,833 --> 01:07:29,125
There's more?

862
01:07:42,291 --> 01:07:45,125
Why are you here all alone? Where's Ali?

863
01:07:45,208 --> 01:07:46,791
He went to get SATRIA.

864
01:07:48,583 --> 01:07:51,041
- You should take cover.
- I can help.

865
01:07:51,125 --> 01:07:54,750
No excuses, you're still recovering.

866
01:07:54,833 --> 01:07:57,250
- Go to the control room now!
- But Papa...

867
01:07:57,333 --> 01:07:58,625
<i>Dey!</i>

868
01:08:02,333 --> 01:08:04,083
Just this once.

869
01:08:04,875 --> 01:08:06,375
Please listen to me.

870
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:22,916
Be careful.

871
01:08:31,458 --> 01:08:32,500
Go already!

872
01:11:04,583 --> 01:11:06,875
Stop him, Ali.

873
01:11:07,666 --> 01:11:10,125
Stop SATRIA.

874
01:11:14,375 --> 01:11:15,625
Alicia!

875
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:09,375
SATRIA.

876
01:12:10,208 --> 01:12:11,125
How...

877
01:12:13,291 --> 01:12:16,333
I never thought that she would
sacrifice herself for you.

878
01:12:18,333 --> 01:12:19,250
You...

879
01:12:20,041 --> 01:12:21,541
What have you done?

880
01:12:24,666 --> 01:12:27,666
I didn't do anything.

881
01:12:28,375 --> 01:12:30,875
You're the one responsible
for your actions.

882
01:12:32,125 --> 01:12:33,625
Why are you doing this?

883
01:12:35,083 --> 01:12:36,125
Why not?

884
01:12:36,208 --> 01:12:40,000
You've had no problem being
used in all your missions.

885
01:12:40,083 --> 01:12:43,333
Why would it be wrong for me
to give you a mission

886
01:12:43,416 --> 01:12:45,166
that's more meaningful?

887
01:12:46,416 --> 01:12:51,208
For Cyberaya
to truly drive human progress,

888
01:12:51,291 --> 01:12:53,958
all those who betray that ideal

889
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:56,125
must be eradicated.

890
01:12:56,208 --> 01:12:57,708
<i>Those who rule,</i>

891
01:12:57,791 --> 01:12:59,458
<i>those who lead,</i>

892
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:02,750
<i>and those who defend their injustice.</i>

893
01:13:02,833 --> 01:13:06,125
Your mission to awaken SATRIA

894
01:13:06,208 --> 01:13:07,500
is done.

895
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:09,791
Now the time has come

896
01:13:09,875 --> 01:13:12,625
for me to liberate Cyberaya.

897
01:13:16,708 --> 01:13:18,083
Fascinating.

898
01:13:19,333 --> 01:13:23,375
Alicia's body shows
a heightened level of compatibility.

899
01:13:23,458 --> 01:13:27,833
Not only that, my analysis shows
a more rapid neural activity in her.

900
01:13:29,125 --> 01:13:30,916
I understand now.

901
01:13:31,583 --> 01:13:34,583
This is why she could predict the future

902
01:13:34,666 --> 01:13:36,416
with IRIS.

903
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:37,333
How unfortunate

904
01:13:38,041 --> 01:13:40,916
that you didn't heed her warning.

905
01:13:46,708 --> 01:13:47,833
Careful now.

906
01:13:47,916 --> 01:13:50,125
You wouldn't want to hurt
your friend again, do you?

907
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:09,416
Where are they?

908
01:14:10,041 --> 01:14:12,000
You're too late.

909
01:14:12,583 --> 01:14:14,291
Give it up, Ali!

910
01:14:14,375 --> 01:14:15,833
That's not Ali.

911
01:14:15,916 --> 01:14:17,625
Ali's a little shorter,

912
01:14:17,708 --> 01:14:18,541
like you.

913
01:14:25,541 --> 01:14:27,208
The Island Protocol?

914
01:14:27,291 --> 01:14:28,875
That won't be a problem.

915
01:14:30,166 --> 01:14:32,791
We won't let you leave from here!

916
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:07,833
Ali!

917
01:15:10,625 --> 01:15:13,000
What kind of disaster happened here?

918
01:15:13,083 --> 01:15:14,291
Did you do all this?

919
01:15:16,625 --> 01:15:19,541
You don't know how long
I've waited for this moment.

920
01:15:20,083 --> 01:15:22,416
The moment that
you would kneel at my feet.

921
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:25,791
But wait.
You're not even kneeling anymore.

922
01:15:25,875 --> 01:15:27,208
You're groveling!

923
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,041
I've won, Ali.

924
01:15:31,125 --> 01:15:33,500
I've won...

925
01:15:35,250 --> 01:15:36,333
So noisy.

926
01:15:40,875 --> 01:15:42,583
Ali, get up.

927
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:45,125
We still have work to do.

928
01:15:46,166 --> 01:15:48,583
We must save Cyberaya from Cero.

929
01:15:50,083 --> 01:15:51,625
I don't know what to do.

930
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,041
I did my best.

931
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:57,750
I did what MATA told me to do.

932
01:15:58,916 --> 01:16:01,375
I did everything I'm supposed to.

933
01:16:02,083 --> 01:16:03,208
So?

934
01:16:03,291 --> 01:16:05,000
Just because you tried your best,

935
01:16:05,083 --> 01:16:06,875
nothing bad can happen?

936
01:16:09,125 --> 01:16:10,958
You've been through this before.

937
01:16:11,041 --> 01:16:13,333
You've defeated a lot of MATA's enemies.

938
01:16:13,958 --> 01:16:16,625
Yes, everything seems a little messy now.

939
01:16:17,208 --> 01:16:20,250
But cloudy skies don't always mean
a storm is coming.

940
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:24,000
Don't let their sacrifice
go to waste, Ali.

941
01:16:25,458 --> 01:16:27,125
It's no use just sulking here.

942
01:16:27,208 --> 01:16:28,583
<i>You're MATA too?</i>

943
01:16:28,666 --> 01:16:31,875
<i>Did MATA have no one else to recruit?</i>

944
01:16:33,958 --> 01:16:34,833
Got you.

945
01:16:37,416 --> 01:16:40,125
Alicia is an exceptional agent, Ali.

946
01:16:41,375 --> 01:16:43,458
<i>She has known MATA
since she was a little girl.</i>

947
01:16:44,125 --> 01:16:47,500
<i>And her abilities now
are way beyond her age.</i>

948
01:16:47,583 --> 01:16:49,750
<i>You could learn a thing or two from her.</i>

949
01:16:50,375 --> 01:16:52,250
You're not bad.

950
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,291
<i>You're not so bad yourself.</i>

951
01:16:56,291 --> 01:16:57,333
<i>You've got instincts</i>

952
01:16:58,250 --> 01:16:59,416
<i>and spirit.</i>

953
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:02,083
<i>Alicia!</i>

954
01:17:03,416 --> 01:17:05,250
<i>And you don't even train much.</i>

955
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:09,125
<i>You're okay?</i>

956
01:17:10,291 --> 01:17:12,750
<i>Congratulations, Alicia.
I knew you were going to win!</i>

957
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,666
Agent Zain had a lot of faith
in both of us.

958
01:17:18,750 --> 01:17:19,833
In you!

959
01:17:19,916 --> 01:17:22,375
I want you to become the Super Agent

960
01:17:22,458 --> 01:17:24,541
that we've always hoped for
from the IRIS project.

961
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:28,375
<i>He sacrificed himself
so that we can continue to live.</i>

962
01:17:29,166 --> 01:17:31,041
We can't give up now.

963
01:17:32,375 --> 01:17:34,375
<i>We have to continue his fight!</i>

964
01:17:35,708 --> 01:17:38,708
<i>I never thought that she would
sacrifice herself for you.</i>

965
01:17:39,458 --> 01:17:42,250
<i>Stop him, Ali.</i>

966
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:45,375
Stop SATRIA.

967
01:17:50,625 --> 01:17:52,333
So are you just going to admit defeat

968
01:17:52,416 --> 01:17:54,083
to that brat?

969
01:17:54,166 --> 01:17:55,583
Or are you going to get up and...

970
01:17:55,666 --> 01:17:56,583
I understand.

971
01:18:08,583 --> 01:18:10,791
We still have work to do.

972
01:18:15,916 --> 01:18:19,000
If I'd listened to you sooner,
Agent Rizwan...

973
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:22,375
Uncle Rizwan?

974
01:18:24,291 --> 01:18:26,583
I don't need your apology.

975
01:18:26,666 --> 01:18:28,791
I just need your help in this fight.

976
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:31,833
Okay, are you done?

977
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:33,750
Uncle Rizwan, a word?

978
01:18:34,458 --> 01:18:36,125
What exactly is your plan?

979
01:18:36,208 --> 01:18:38,208
How are we taking down that hunk of metal?

980
01:18:40,625 --> 01:18:42,458
What, how should I know?

981
01:18:47,833 --> 01:18:49,666
He's been using
just this thing to hack every--

982
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:50,583
Wait!

983
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,291
Over here, Dato'.

984
01:19:14,375 --> 01:19:16,291
The safety bunker is just up ahead.

985
01:19:17,125 --> 01:19:18,041
Dato'!

986
01:19:19,291 --> 01:19:20,250
Excuse me.

987
01:19:20,333 --> 01:19:21,541
Dr. Ghazali.

988
01:19:21,625 --> 01:19:22,916
What is going on?

989
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,958
Cyberaya is under a critical threat.

990
01:19:26,041 --> 01:19:28,708
You've all been brought here
for protection.

991
01:19:29,375 --> 01:19:32,416
- What threat?
- I'll explain later, doctor.

992
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:33,875
We need to move now.

993
01:19:34,541 --> 01:19:35,958
But my son?

994
01:19:36,041 --> 01:19:37,125
What about my son?

995
01:19:37,208 --> 01:19:40,208
We will take care of everything,
don't worry.

996
01:19:42,083 --> 01:19:43,250
Amir, Elle.

997
01:19:44,375 --> 01:19:45,583
SATRIA's location.

998
01:19:47,333 --> 01:19:48,833
You two go on ahead.

999
01:19:48,916 --> 01:19:50,583
We'll protect Dato' here.

1000
01:19:52,958 --> 01:19:54,416
Yeah, right.

1001
01:19:55,041 --> 01:19:57,250
If you're afraid to get your hands dirty,

1002
01:19:57,333 --> 01:19:59,000
what's the point in being a Pillar Leader?

1003
01:20:08,166 --> 01:20:09,750
Did you call for backup?

1004
01:20:09,833 --> 01:20:11,875
Yeah, I hope they'll show up.

1005
01:20:13,083 --> 01:20:14,291
{\an8}How is it going?

1006
01:20:14,375 --> 01:20:15,458
{\an8}Just a little more.

1007
01:20:15,541 --> 01:20:18,291
{\an8}I'm using IRIS to reverse-engineer
Neonimus's program

1008
01:20:18,375 --> 01:20:19,916
and create its counter,

1009
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,166
like an antivirus.

1010
01:20:22,333 --> 01:20:24,125
If we can plant it in SATRIA,

1011
01:20:24,833 --> 01:20:26,166
we'll be able to reset it.

1012
01:20:31,958 --> 01:20:33,416
No defenses?

1013
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:35,291
That's strange.

1014
01:20:35,375 --> 01:20:37,000
Ali, find out where he is.

1015
01:21:00,250 --> 01:21:01,458
Finally.

1016
01:21:03,375 --> 01:21:06,833
I was hoping you'd get here in time.

1017
01:21:08,041 --> 01:21:10,916
This is the only chance I will give you.

1018
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:13,291
Join me.

1019
01:21:13,375 --> 01:21:16,250
Or your lives end here.

1020
01:21:16,333 --> 01:21:19,333
Not if I destroy you first!

1021
01:21:26,208 --> 01:21:28,791
Do you know what the Island Protocol is?

1022
01:21:34,375 --> 01:21:36,458
It is the last resort.

1023
01:21:36,541 --> 01:21:39,208
If there is a Cyberaya invention

1024
01:21:39,291 --> 01:21:42,291
that becomes an uncontrollable threat,

1025
01:21:43,083 --> 01:21:46,541
<i>all individuals of significance are
taken away to a secret island.</i>

1026
01:21:46,625 --> 01:21:48,166
<i>Off-grid.</i>

1027
01:21:50,166 --> 01:21:54,291
<i>It is clear they knew well in advance
that they were playing with fire.</i>

1028
01:21:54,375 --> 01:21:56,458
<i>But have they ever thought about</i>

1029
01:21:56,541 --> 01:21:58,458
<i>the safety of the civilians?</i>

1030
01:21:59,125 --> 01:22:02,625
<i>They may be able to cover their tracks.</i>

1031
01:22:02,708 --> 01:22:04,666
But they won't be able to escape

1032
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:07,916
the explosive power of Azurium here.

1033
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,916
But if you do that,

1034
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,875
Cyberaya will be devastated!

1035
01:22:13,583 --> 01:22:15,166
Not entirely.

1036
01:22:15,250 --> 01:22:19,125
A small price to pay for the greater good.

1037
01:22:22,083 --> 01:22:23,375
There, hurry!

1038
01:22:24,208 --> 01:22:26,041
Now that you know,

1039
01:22:26,125 --> 01:22:27,875
do you not see

1040
01:22:27,958 --> 01:22:30,541
how futile all your efforts were?

1041
01:23:02,375 --> 01:23:04,500
No, Dos! Alicia is trapped in there.

1042
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,666
How can I possibly be defeated
by my own moves?

1043
01:25:06,708 --> 01:25:08,916
There is no point in delaying it.

1044
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,125
Let's finish this!

1045
01:25:12,416 --> 01:25:14,083
Stop!

1046
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:34,000
<i>You've all been used...</i>

1047
01:25:34,708 --> 01:25:38,416
<i>For Cyberaya
to truly drive human progress,</i>

1048
01:25:39,416 --> 01:25:42,583
<i>all those who betray that ideal</i>

1049
01:25:42,666 --> 01:25:43,875
<i>must be eradicated.</i>

1050
01:25:49,250 --> 01:25:51,000
Ali, what happened?

1051
01:25:51,750 --> 01:25:52,708
Ali!

1052
01:26:18,083 --> 01:26:21,041
Get up, we need to get out of here!

1053
01:26:21,125 --> 01:26:22,250
No.

1054
01:26:22,333 --> 01:26:24,041
We must stand our ground.

1055
01:26:24,125 --> 01:26:26,791
If not, the whole place will collapse
and trigger an explosion!

1056
01:26:42,333 --> 01:26:43,750
Need a hand?

1057
01:26:53,083 --> 01:26:54,375
SATRIA.

1058
01:26:54,916 --> 01:26:57,208
Please. Don't do this.

1059
01:26:59,333 --> 01:27:01,458
There's no point in pleading.

1060
01:27:10,416 --> 01:27:14,958
He only takes orders from me now.

1061
01:27:26,833 --> 01:27:28,083
Cero.

1062
01:27:28,916 --> 01:27:32,000
SATRIA will never stray
from its objective.

1063
01:27:33,291 --> 01:27:34,958
Unlike Uno,

1064
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:36,750
Cinco,

1065
01:27:38,125 --> 01:27:39,541
or you.

1066
01:27:46,291 --> 01:27:48,458
You've made a big mistake
by showing up here.

1067
01:28:02,666 --> 01:28:04,291
What have you done to Ali?

1068
01:28:04,375 --> 01:28:06,541
He fell into his own trap.

1069
01:28:08,875 --> 01:28:11,875
Even if IRIS invades the SATRIA dimension,

1070
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:14,333
he won't gain control

1071
01:28:14,416 --> 01:28:17,166
as long as I'm still here.

1072
01:28:31,625 --> 01:28:33,583
Why won't you admit defeat?

1073
01:28:34,333 --> 01:28:37,750
SATRIA is equipped with data
on every one of your abilities.

1074
01:28:43,083 --> 01:28:45,833
What hope do you even have of winning?

1075
01:29:00,875 --> 01:29:02,041
You're wrong!

1076
01:29:08,666 --> 01:29:10,291
I still have instincts.

1077
01:29:11,583 --> 01:29:13,583
I still have spirit.

1078
01:29:19,125 --> 01:29:22,416
SATRIA will never be able
to imitate a true human soul!

1079
01:29:57,583 --> 01:29:59,666
It is human nature

1080
01:29:59,750 --> 01:30:02,958
not to know their own limitations.

1081
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:12,833
He's using data
from all the Pillar Leaders.

1082
01:30:17,583 --> 01:30:19,500
I will show you

1083
01:30:19,583 --> 01:30:22,458
how fragile the human soul can be.

1084
01:30:34,541 --> 01:30:35,541
Alicia!

1085
01:30:45,041 --> 01:30:47,625
What are you all doing here?

1086
01:30:47,708 --> 01:30:49,791
This is all your fault!

1087
01:31:06,625 --> 01:31:10,000
I can create a magnetic field
to interfere with his orientation.

1088
01:31:10,083 --> 01:31:11,041
Find an opening.

1089
01:31:57,833 --> 01:31:59,250
Dayang!

1090
01:32:40,333 --> 01:32:41,291
Alicia!

1091
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:05,750
I've won, Ali. I've won!

1092
01:33:07,125 --> 01:33:09,125
I've won!

1093
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:11,125
What are you going to do about it?

1094
01:33:16,833 --> 01:33:18,708
- Why...
- Sorry, Alicia.

1095
01:33:19,333 --> 01:33:20,750
It was an accident.

1096
01:33:38,708 --> 01:33:41,750
It's okay, my dear. Don't be sad.

1097
01:34:01,333 --> 01:34:03,833
You can rest now, Ali.

1098
01:34:29,125 --> 01:34:30,125
Alicia?

1099
01:34:31,125 --> 01:34:32,791
Is that really you?

1100
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,791
Seriously, do I have
to babysit you all the time?

1101
01:34:42,416 --> 01:34:43,333
Alicia...

1102
01:34:45,375 --> 01:34:48,791
I should've listened to you.

1103
01:34:48,875 --> 01:34:50,750
Never mind, it's like I told you before.

1104
01:34:50,833 --> 01:34:52,750
You don't use your brain enough.

1105
01:34:56,250 --> 01:34:57,583
How amusing.

1106
01:34:59,125 --> 01:35:03,041
Unfortunately, you'll both
be entombed here.

1107
01:35:09,666 --> 01:35:11,416
How does he keep doing all this?

1108
01:35:12,250 --> 01:35:13,583
You can too, you know.

1109
01:35:14,791 --> 01:35:16,125
You're in Override Mode, remember?

1110
01:35:17,791 --> 01:35:19,416
Ali!

1111
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:28,000
You're right!

1112
01:35:29,625 --> 01:35:31,708
I haven't been using my brain enough.

1113
01:36:17,750 --> 01:36:19,083
<i>Cero.</i>

1114
01:36:19,166 --> 01:36:21,791
<i>Have you finished your homework?</i>

1115
01:36:24,333 --> 01:36:25,416
What homework?

1116
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:27,750
What homework, you say?

1117
01:37:09,791 --> 01:37:10,875
Ouch!

1118
01:37:19,666 --> 01:37:21,041
SATRIA...

1119
01:37:21,125 --> 01:37:23,375
is the perfect agent.

1120
01:37:24,083 --> 01:37:26,625
It is impossible to defeat me!

1121
01:37:27,750 --> 01:37:29,916
No point in being perfect

1122
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,458
if you don't know about

1123
01:37:31,541 --> 01:37:33,333
our special attack!

1124
01:37:37,041 --> 01:37:40,250
{\an8}SATRIA, KELEMBAI, DETECTIVE JEBAT

1125
01:37:57,166 --> 01:37:58,208
- Nice!
- Nice!

1126
01:38:24,875 --> 01:38:25,875
Over here, hurry!

1127
01:38:33,625 --> 01:38:34,625
Over there!

1128
01:39:00,250 --> 01:39:01,125
Ali!

1129
01:39:02,583 --> 01:39:05,250
I will never let you win!

1130
01:39:10,958 --> 01:39:13,416
You won't get away with this!

1131
01:39:20,333 --> 01:39:21,708
Thank you, Ali.

1132
01:39:22,708 --> 01:39:25,208
You have saved me time and again.

1133
01:39:37,791 --> 01:39:38,625
Alicia?

1134
01:39:44,125 --> 01:39:45,166
Alicia!

1135
01:39:48,916 --> 01:39:51,000
No!

1136
01:39:59,333 --> 01:40:00,166
Alicia!

1137
01:40:02,458 --> 01:40:03,291
Alicia.

1138
01:40:03,916 --> 01:40:04,875
Wake up.

1139
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:06,666
Wake up!

1140
01:40:26,916 --> 01:40:29,250
Do you want me to do it?

1141
01:40:29,333 --> 01:40:30,458
It's okay.

1142
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:32,333
I can do it.

1143
01:40:32,416 --> 01:40:33,458
It's just...

1144
01:40:35,666 --> 01:40:37,250
I don't know where it went wrong.

1145
01:40:37,333 --> 01:40:39,708
Don't be too hard on yourself.

1146
01:40:39,791 --> 01:40:42,000
If it weren't for Cero
pulling the strings...

1147
01:40:42,916 --> 01:40:45,000
I don't need the pep talk, Ganz.

1148
01:40:45,083 --> 01:40:47,333
What was I supposed to say?

1149
01:40:47,916 --> 01:40:50,125
Zain would've known
what's the right thing to do.

1150
01:40:50,208 --> 01:40:51,416
Don't worry.

1151
01:40:51,958 --> 01:40:53,958
There's a reason for everything.

1152
01:40:54,041 --> 01:40:55,458
{\an8}I'm starting to see

1153
01:40:55,541 --> 01:40:59,041
{\an8}why Amir and Elle were chosen to join us.

1154
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
I didn't think you'd warm up
to them so quickly.

1155
01:41:14,250 --> 01:41:17,041
We will be taking over the project now.

1156
01:41:17,666 --> 01:41:18,708
What?

1157
01:41:18,791 --> 01:41:21,000
You want to go on with the project?

1158
01:41:21,625 --> 01:41:23,041
I disagree.

1159
01:41:23,125 --> 01:41:26,875
Unfortunately, that decision
is no longer in your hands.

1160
01:41:26,958 --> 01:41:28,000
Agent Dayang.

1161
01:41:28,833 --> 01:41:32,166
You are hereby suspended
from your role as Tekno's Pillar Leader.

1162
01:41:32,250 --> 01:41:34,041
Effective immediately.

1163
01:41:35,583 --> 01:41:37,541
Dato', you can't do this!

1164
01:41:37,625 --> 01:41:39,166
Why not?

1165
01:41:39,250 --> 01:41:42,541
Your creations have repeatedly
put Cyberaya in mortal danger.

1166
01:41:42,625 --> 01:41:44,958
You didn't think there
would be consequences?

1167
01:41:45,041 --> 01:41:46,541
How dare you!

1168
01:41:46,625 --> 01:41:49,958
- After all she's done for this city?
- Ganz.

1169
01:41:52,041 --> 01:41:53,000
I understand.

1170
01:41:53,708 --> 01:41:56,625
I accept whatever sanction
you feel is appropriate.

1171
01:41:58,625 --> 01:42:00,750
MATA will continue to operate

1172
01:42:00,833 --> 01:42:03,291
under the leadership
of three Pillar Leaders

1173
01:42:03,375 --> 01:42:06,791
until you are eligible
to be promoted again.

1174
01:42:07,458 --> 01:42:11,833
Or until I find
a more suitable replacement.

1175
01:42:13,083 --> 01:42:14,250
What a joke!

1176
01:42:14,333 --> 01:42:16,458
Is there a problem, Agent Ganz?

1177
01:42:16,541 --> 01:42:17,958
They would never understand

1178
01:42:18,041 --> 01:42:20,541
the weight of protecting Cyberaya.

1179
01:42:20,625 --> 01:42:24,583
If you think that I would continue
to serve without Dayang,

1180
01:42:24,666 --> 01:42:26,041
you must be out of your mind.

1181
01:42:26,708 --> 01:42:27,791
Good.

1182
01:42:27,875 --> 01:42:30,041
You've just made things easier for me.

1183
01:42:30,125 --> 01:42:33,458
I don't need anyone
who's uncooperative on my team.

1184
01:42:34,083 --> 01:42:36,583
Please exit the facility immediately

1185
01:42:36,666 --> 01:42:39,083
before you are taken away by force.

1186
01:43:24,750 --> 01:43:26,708
All right, students. Time's up.

1187
01:43:26,791 --> 01:43:28,458
Eyes off the paper.

1188
01:43:28,541 --> 01:43:32,041
Put your pencils down and press send.

1189
01:43:36,250 --> 01:43:37,833
This is your last paper,

1190
01:43:37,916 --> 01:43:40,750
so I hereby declare that

1191
01:43:40,833 --> 01:43:44,416
the finals are over!

1192
01:43:46,166 --> 01:43:48,291
Freedom!

1193
01:43:48,375 --> 01:43:50,083
Don't be so dramatic.

1194
01:43:50,958 --> 01:43:52,666
Here are your results!

1195
01:43:57,750 --> 01:44:00,416
Hey, how come your score is
better than mine?

1196
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:01,666
Didn't you just copy off me?

1197
01:44:02,500 --> 01:44:04,708
I have to re-sit?

1198
01:44:04,791 --> 01:44:06,750
No!

1199
01:44:08,083 --> 01:44:09,625
Viktor, look.

1200
01:44:10,583 --> 01:44:12,416
- That's amazing.
- Can I see yours?

1201
01:44:12,500 --> 01:44:13,750
How many A's did you get?

1202
01:44:17,458 --> 01:44:18,458
We're the same?

1203
01:44:18,541 --> 01:44:20,708
We studied together.

1204
01:44:20,791 --> 01:44:22,791
Of course we'll get the same results.

1205
01:44:22,875 --> 01:44:25,291
That's fine, at least you didn't beat me.

1206
01:44:26,208 --> 01:44:27,791
Ali, what about you?

1207
01:44:29,833 --> 01:44:32,625
You've got more A's?

1208
01:44:32,708 --> 01:44:35,166
But how? When did you...

1209
01:44:35,958 --> 01:44:38,208
I lost to Ali?

1210
01:44:44,625 --> 01:44:47,500
That's awesome, congratulations!

1211
01:44:48,125 --> 01:44:49,208
Thank you.

1212
01:44:54,125 --> 01:44:56,041
I'm so glad the exams are over at last.

1213
01:44:57,958 --> 01:45:00,708
- Let's grab a bite at Mamak Maju.
- Sounds great.

1214
01:45:00,791 --> 01:45:03,958
Then let's hang out and play games!

1215
01:45:05,083 --> 01:45:08,791
I'm good. I'm a bit tired.

1216
01:45:08,875 --> 01:45:11,500
You guys go ahead. I'll call later.

1217
01:45:13,750 --> 01:45:16,583
Gosh, someone thinks
he's better than us now.

1218
01:45:23,416 --> 01:45:25,416
So, the exams are over.

1219
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:28,291
You would've totally aced it as usual.

1220
01:45:29,916 --> 01:45:33,416
As for Neonimus, MATA still hasn't
been able to track him down.

1221
01:45:35,125 --> 01:45:36,625
But it looks like

1222
01:45:36,708 --> 01:45:38,666
he's leaving me alone for now.

1223
01:45:42,125 --> 01:45:43,125
Here.

1224
01:45:43,208 --> 01:45:44,583
This belongs to you.

1225
01:46:02,166 --> 01:46:03,708
Please wake up, Alicia.

1226
01:46:05,083 --> 01:46:06,083
You...

1227
01:46:06,166 --> 01:46:08,333
don't want to go on missions anymore?

1228
01:46:18,541 --> 01:46:19,375
Agent Geetha!

1229
01:46:20,416 --> 01:46:21,250
Move!

1230
01:46:22,625 --> 01:46:25,166
- Move aside, move!
- Where's Icha?

1231
01:46:25,250 --> 01:46:26,666
Where's Icha!

1232
01:46:32,708 --> 01:46:34,333
Icha!

1233
01:46:39,916 --> 01:46:42,583
I was so worried about you!

1234
01:46:42,666 --> 01:46:44,125
Are you okay?

1235
01:46:46,083 --> 01:46:48,958
She's in stable condition.

1236
01:46:49,833 --> 01:46:50,875
But...

1237
01:46:56,083 --> 01:46:57,333
Glad you're okay, Alicia.

1238
01:46:58,166 --> 01:46:59,000
What?

1239
01:47:05,750 --> 01:47:07,416
Who are all of you?

1240
01:48:40,166 --> 01:48:42,458
So, what now?

1241
01:48:42,541 --> 01:48:46,083
Are we supposed to just let
those clowns take over MATA?

1242
01:48:47,041 --> 01:48:49,750
We have more important matters
to attend to right now.

1243
01:48:49,833 --> 01:48:52,083
What could be more important...

1244
01:48:52,166 --> 01:48:53,875
Wait, where are we going?

1245
01:48:55,583 --> 01:48:57,916
Keep it down. Just follow me.

1246
01:49:05,750 --> 01:49:07,583
Are you getting something from here?

1247
01:49:09,666 --> 01:49:11,291
You can come out now.

1248
01:49:22,333 --> 01:49:23,583
Go on.

1249
01:49:23,666 --> 01:49:26,583
What do you want to tell us about Cero?

1250
01:49:27,250 --> 01:49:29,541
I managed to get this from Neonimus.

1251
01:49:30,166 --> 01:49:32,000
Right before he escaped.

1252
01:49:32,083 --> 01:49:34,000
It's all in here.

1253
01:49:34,083 --> 01:49:36,500
Their plans, communication logs.

1254
01:49:38,083 --> 01:49:39,750
Did you track him down?

1255
01:49:40,916 --> 01:49:43,291
Not yet, everything's encrypted.

1256
01:49:43,375 --> 01:49:45,250
I was hoping you could help.

1257
01:49:48,333 --> 01:49:51,250
You're not seriously thinking
of working with him?

1258
01:54:30,791 --> 01:54:32,458
If we show her this,

1259
01:54:32,541 --> 01:54:33,958
do you think she'd remember?

1260
01:54:38,625 --> 01:54:40,000
Oh, her records are in here.

1261
01:54:44,500 --> 01:54:47,791
Why is her history file locked?

1262
01:54:52,125 --> 01:54:53,083
<i>Comot.</i>

1263
01:54:53,166 --> 01:54:55,416
<i>We still have work to do.</i>

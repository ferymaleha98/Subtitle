2
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.500
Kir, wake up, it's late.
The kids should go to the school.

3
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.082
Ben, we have the maid.

4
00:01:55.124 --> 00:01:58.641
It's been a month
since she goes back to her hometown.

5
00:02:02.907 --> 00:02:04.050
God..

6
00:02:04.893 --> 00:02:09.272
Oh, God. We're late.
Hurry, wake the kids, I'll cook.

7
00:02:09.314 --> 00:02:10.314
Kir.

8
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.502
I'll be going in a minute.

9
00:02:12.544 --> 00:02:15.259
You're not going
to drop the kids to school?

10
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.459
I can't, I'm in a hurry.
Still waiting a taxi.

11
00:02:19.471 --> 00:02:22.429
I thought today I could... Forget it.

12
00:02:22.757 --> 00:02:24.357
Could what?

13
00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:27.632
Could be free. Kidding, Ben.

14
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.540
Besides, this is my job.

15
00:02:31.433 --> 00:02:34.136
I'm sorry, lately I'm busy.

16
00:02:34.178 --> 00:02:37.636
You know that Mr. Tanoto always
ask for a daily evaluation.

17
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.107
Would you forgive me?

18
00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:45.774
It's okay, work hard so you get bonus
and we can go to Singapore.

19
00:02:46.793 --> 00:02:50.918
Singapore?
Are you sure want to go to Singapore?

20
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.578
It's better if we use the money for...

21
00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:55.161
I'm joking, Ben.

22
00:02:55.202 --> 00:02:58.537
It's better we use the money
for house and car installments, right?

23
00:02:59.893 --> 00:03:03.653
I'm going. Here, let me kiss you.

24
00:03:04.333 --> 00:03:08.252
-My face's dirty, Ben.
-It's okay, come here.

25
00:03:09.211 --> 00:03:10.836
-Serious?
-Yes.

26
00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:13.192
Just kidding, Kir.

27
00:03:16.698 --> 00:03:18.573
Rega, Windy.

28
00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.609
Honey, what happen to your hair?

29
00:03:23.077 --> 00:03:26.952
Mom, today I want to do my hair
like my idol, Rihanna.

30
00:03:27.177 --> 00:03:30.677
What if looks like Taylor Swift,
pony tail?

31
00:03:30.718 --> 00:03:33.096
I like Rihanna.

32
00:03:33.138 --> 00:03:37.079
Why don't you like Tukul?
It's more simple.

33
00:03:39.752 --> 00:03:41.601
Mom, there's a fire.

34
00:03:44.565 --> 00:03:45.773
Horror.

35
00:03:47.396 --> 00:03:48.729
So close.

36
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.989
Mom, Windy.
Windy is allergic to peanuts!

37
00:03:52.452 --> 00:03:55.827
Windy, stop. Spit it out, don't eat it!

38
00:03:58.141 --> 00:03:59.641
Mom, it's burnt!

39
00:03:59.682 --> 00:04:02.765
-I want to sit in the front, my turn.
-But I'm older.

40
00:04:07.712 --> 00:04:10.392
-Kirana, hi.
-Hi, Lidya!

41
00:04:14.267 --> 00:04:16.415
-Mom, Windy.
-What about Windy?

42
00:04:16.457 --> 00:04:17.498
She's still at the house.

43
00:04:18.674 --> 00:04:19.807
Gosh.

44
00:04:26.778 --> 00:04:30.384
Windy. Go inside the car.

45
00:04:31.456 --> 00:04:33.789
Rihanna sits in the front.

46
00:04:34.532 --> 00:04:37.157
Tukul sits in the back, right?

47
00:04:45.107 --> 00:04:49.906
Late, we're late. Come, hurry.

48
00:04:49.947 --> 00:04:55.614
Hurry, go, hurry, run. You're late.

49
00:04:56.107 --> 00:05:01.066
Sir, please open it!

50
00:05:01.107 --> 00:05:03.406
I can't, Ma'am. I'm scared
that Mrs. Rhonda will scold me.

51
00:05:03.447 --> 00:05:06.106
Mrs. Rhonda is so fierce
just like a hungry tiger.

52
00:05:06.147 --> 00:05:09.986
Mrs. Rhonda is fierce,
but you're so kind.

53
00:05:10.027 --> 00:05:12.551
Open it, it's the last time we're late.

54
00:05:12.593 --> 00:05:16.010
-One last time? No more late?
-We promise!

55
00:05:16.051 --> 00:05:19.711
-I am kind, right? So kind?
-You're so kind.

56
00:05:24.267 --> 00:05:27.486
I can't do that, rules are rules.

57
00:05:27.527 --> 00:05:31.647
If Mrs. Rhonda said no, it means no.
I listen to Mrs. Rhonda

58
00:05:35.467 --> 00:05:38.634
Good morning, kind-hearted Mrs. Rhonda.

59
00:05:39.587 --> 00:05:41.670
-Welcome...
-Mrs. Sisca.

60
00:05:43.344 --> 00:05:45.844
I'm sorry, Ma'am, I'm late.

61
00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:47.616
It's okay.

62
00:05:47.658 --> 00:05:52.637
I'm grateful you can come here
to be a speaker for our children.

63
00:05:52.687 --> 00:05:55.326
It's my pleasure, I'm so excited.

64
00:05:55.367 --> 00:05:59.034
I'd like to share my experiences
as a movie producer, Ma'am.

65
00:05:59.075 --> 00:06:02.774
Especially to a young girls.
We must educated young girls.

66
00:06:02.827 --> 00:06:05.577
They shouldn't satisfied
with just become a housewives.

67
00:06:05.618 --> 00:06:08.701
Why? Because
we have the same opportunity.

68
00:06:08.742 --> 00:06:12.281
Whatever we want, whatever career
we want, we could get it.

69
00:06:12.307 --> 00:06:15.406
Am I right? Don't you agree?

70
00:06:15.447 --> 00:06:18.572
-Please, welcome.
-Sisca, Sisca Malandouw.

71
00:06:19.807 --> 00:06:25.966
Kirana Permatasari?
Oh, my God, how come we meet here?

72
00:06:26.007 --> 00:06:27.346
Your children go to school here?

73
00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:30.413
Your children? Hello, I'm Sisca.

74
00:06:30.455 --> 00:06:32.686
Back in the days, we were a group.
Friends of your mother.

75
00:06:32.727 --> 00:06:35.866
We're called Screaming Queens.

76
00:06:35.907 --> 00:06:37.086
We're the most hype.

77
00:06:37.127 --> 00:06:40.806
You know, your mother was chairman
of Student Council and cheerleaders.

78
00:06:40.847 --> 00:06:43.386
She got good grades, she was so cool.

79
00:06:43.427 --> 00:06:48.346
You're still seeing the other girls?
Let me save your number, okay?

80
00:06:48.387 --> 00:06:51.100
My WhatsApp is error, Sis.

81
00:06:51.142 --> 00:06:53.306
-Mrs. Sisca...
-Sorry, in a minute.

82
00:06:53.347 --> 00:06:56.486
Did you meet with Yanti and Indah?
They must be thrilled to see you.

83
00:06:56.527 --> 00:07:01.506
You know Yanti?
Now, her rendang is everywhere.

84
00:07:01.547 --> 00:07:05.926
And Indah's batik boutique
is selling well. It's so cool.

85
00:07:05.967 --> 00:07:07.566
Where have you been? You never show up!

86
00:07:07.607 --> 00:07:10.309
I know,
usually people goes MIA like this,...

87
00:07:10.351 --> 00:07:12.108
are the most successful.

88
00:07:12.627 --> 00:07:13.752
Ouch.

89
00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:17.719
Of course she said nothing,
you keep blabbing.

90
00:07:18.487 --> 00:07:23.029
I'm sorry. I'm going to keep quiet,
so I can be a success.

91
00:07:23.587 --> 00:07:26.756
Mrs. Sisca, do the reunion later.

92
00:07:26.798 --> 00:07:29.586
The children is waiting for you.
Please come in.

93
00:07:29.627 --> 00:07:32.092
-Mr. Sueb, take her to the classroom.
-Okay.

94
00:07:32.134 --> 00:07:34.176
Na, see you later, I'm already late.

95
00:07:35.127 --> 00:07:37.087
Rega, Windy, go inside.

96
00:07:40.227 --> 00:07:44.310
Ma'am, I want to talk with you
at my office.

97
00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:47.251
What do you think, Ma'am?

98
00:07:48.224 --> 00:07:50.765
Rega's grade? It's dropping, right?

99
00:07:51.001 --> 00:07:54.376
Sliding to rock bottom.

100
00:07:55.267 --> 00:07:57.045
We should feel sad.

101
00:07:58.564 --> 00:08:00.481
If we received payment,
then we should happy.

102
00:08:00.507 --> 00:08:02.705
Is there a problems at home?

103
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.584
A fight with your husband?

104
00:08:06.027 --> 00:08:09.235
Divorce? Other woman?

105
00:08:10.014 --> 00:08:12.966
Or you're the one with other man?

106
00:08:13.382 --> 00:08:15.507
So, you are a homewrecker.

107
00:08:17.741 --> 00:08:21.866
Sorry, I'm just joking.
There's more important matter.

108
00:08:22.127 --> 00:08:25.006
The school's role is important
for educating children.

109
00:08:25.047 --> 00:08:28.172
But it is more important for you
as a parent...

110
00:08:28.213 --> 00:08:30.838
to supervise children studying at home.

111
00:08:31.687 --> 00:08:33.645
Especially if you don't work.

112
00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:37.389
I'm working, I'm a housewive.

113
00:08:38.987 --> 00:08:41.527
Are you get paid? No, right?

114
00:08:42.467 --> 00:08:46.592
So, you have a lot of time to closely
supervise your children to study.

115
00:08:46.633 --> 00:08:49.353
Not just a pants should be tight.

116
00:08:50.396 --> 00:08:52.646
Closely supervise your children.

117
00:08:54.521 --> 00:08:57.146
Who likes cartoons?

118
00:08:57.187 --> 00:08:59.021
-Me!
-Me!

119
00:08:59.062 --> 00:09:01.103
Who wants to produce a movie?

120
00:09:01.144 --> 00:09:03.478
-Me!
-Me!

121
00:09:03.519 --> 00:09:09.102
If you want to do that,
you need to study hard.

122
00:09:37.027 --> 00:09:40.167
Turns out that Kirana Permatasari
is just a housewife.

123
00:09:44.407 --> 00:09:47.406
Excuse me?

124
00:09:48.814 --> 00:09:51.272
The total is 375.000 rupiahs.

125
00:10:04.367 --> 00:10:06.075
What are you looking at?

126
00:10:08.012 --> 00:10:12.012
It's Lidya.
She's so awesome, right, Ben?

127
00:10:12.053 --> 00:10:17.653
Good career, successful, mom to be.

128
00:10:21.147 --> 00:10:22.232
Oh, you.

129
00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:28.106
You're awesome too.

130
00:10:28.148 --> 00:10:32.482
You take care of me,
take care the children. Thank you.

131
00:10:33.924 --> 00:10:35.674
But you often late.

132
00:10:38.234 --> 00:10:39.900
Smelly.

133
00:10:40.471 --> 00:10:45.096
How can I not be late?
My time is spent smelling your farts.

134
00:10:45.927 --> 00:10:49.219
Oh, you. Come one.

135
00:10:54.523 --> 00:10:57.982
Kir, I set every clocks in this house
half hour earlier.

136
00:10:58.024 --> 00:10:59.564
So, you're not late anymore.

137
00:11:00.187 --> 00:11:04.367
Ben, are you underestimating me?
I can wake up early.

138
00:11:05.467 --> 00:11:07.947
Rega, Windy, dinner's ready!

139
00:11:09.127 --> 00:11:12.587
-Have you called Mrs. Diah again?
-She's not picking up.

140
00:11:13.187 --> 00:11:16.807
It seems she's mad.
We can't be too hard on her.

141
00:11:17.247 --> 00:11:19.195
I told her nicely.

142
00:11:19.237 --> 00:11:22.788
She can't do the laundry,
all my clothes are ruined.

143
00:11:23.367 --> 00:11:25.118
Lets get a new maid.

144
00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.912
No need, I can do it by myself.

145
00:11:29.281 --> 00:11:32.990
You said it yourself
we have to live providently.

146
00:11:43.933 --> 00:11:46.099
School.

147
00:11:47.286 --> 00:11:50.828
Rega, why did you read like that?
Do it as usual.

148
00:11:51.967 --> 00:11:56.800
I'm confused, Mom.
All the letters are juggling.

149
00:11:59.611 --> 00:12:00.695
Read it again.

150
00:12:01.156 --> 00:12:04.198
On Saturday...

151
00:12:05.193 --> 00:12:08.943
School... Yes, school.

152
00:12:14.975 --> 00:12:20.850
Rega is diagnosed with dyslexia.
Even though, it's an early stage.

153
00:12:21.149 --> 00:12:26.982
He will need an intensive treatment
and attention from both of you.

154
00:12:42.448 --> 00:12:43.576
It's okay.

155
00:12:45.479 --> 00:12:47.562
The doctor said it's cureable.

156
00:12:49.853 --> 00:12:50.895
Okay?

157
00:12:52.731 --> 00:12:55.071
But the cost is so big, Ben.

158
00:12:56.763 --> 00:12:58.263
Should I get a job?

159
00:12:58.847 --> 00:13:00.340
No.

160
00:13:01.512 --> 00:13:04.345
If you work,
who'll take care the children?

161
00:13:06.067 --> 00:13:10.275
Poor Rega. Rega needs you the most, Kir.

162
00:13:15.403 --> 00:13:17.293
I know you're worried.

163
00:13:19.782 --> 00:13:21.472
But trust me.

164
00:13:22.995 --> 00:13:25.078
Insyaallah, there's a way out.

165
00:13:27.766 --> 00:13:30.169
Okay, come here.

166
00:13:32.786 --> 00:13:33.953
Let me massage you.

167
00:13:37.027 --> 00:13:40.652
Whatever happens,
we'll face it together.

168
00:13:46.307 --> 00:13:47.757
You're nasty, Kir.

169
00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:54.102
You keep calling me Kir.
Call me something romantic.

170
00:13:54.147 --> 00:13:57.626
Dear, honey, sweety.

171
00:13:57.667 --> 00:14:01.607
That's not important.
What's important is my feelings for you.

172
00:14:03.147 --> 00:14:05.867
-Playboy.
-Nasty.

173
00:14:08.302 --> 00:14:09.334
Diana.

174
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.802
She wants to meet up,
she just got back from Europe.

175
00:14:13.987 --> 00:14:17.195
She's so great,
her PR works are everywhere.

176
00:14:17.843 --> 00:14:20.093
See. She's so beautiful, Ben.

177
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:25.126
Back in high school,
she had a crush on you.

178
00:14:25.527 --> 00:14:29.127
Why did you say no to her?
You could be married to her right now.

179
00:14:31.105 --> 00:14:33.230
She isn't married until now.

180
00:14:33.814 --> 00:14:36.439
Could it be that her heart
is still stuck on you?

181
00:14:38.006 --> 00:14:40.813
But I'm stuck with you, Kir.

182
00:14:40.855 --> 00:14:42.980
Keep calling me Kir. Do you think Bokir?

183
00:14:43.907 --> 00:14:47.150
-I'm going to get the children to bed.
-Me?

184
00:14:47.848 --> 00:14:49.723
I'm heading to, I mean.

185
00:14:52.707 --> 00:14:53.790
Gross.

186
00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:57.441
Na, these are souvenirs
for Windy and Rega.

187
00:14:57.483 --> 00:15:01.144
-I miss them so much.
-Thank you.

188
00:15:01.167 --> 00:15:02.292
Wait a minute, Na.

189
00:15:05.007 --> 00:15:08.022
Yes, don't forget to bring
the case file for Mr. Gunawan.

190
00:15:08.062 --> 00:15:11.312
So, I know what kind of brand image
that will fit the most. Thank you.

191
00:15:13.292 --> 00:15:16.125
Indra is so terrible, he's so slow.

192
00:15:16.847 --> 00:15:21.905
Indra, our junior?
My secretary at the Student Council?

193
00:15:22.314 --> 00:15:25.814
I'm looking for the right moment
to fired him.

194
00:15:27.075 --> 00:15:30.116
Our school will hold a reunion.
Please come this time!

195
00:15:30.167 --> 00:15:31.446
I'm the chairman of this event.

196
00:15:31.487 --> 00:15:33.607
It will be fun.
We're having a costume party.

197
00:15:35.467 --> 00:15:37.016
-No, thanks.
-What?

198
00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.898
Why not? Not in the mood?
Or not confidence?

199
00:15:41.267 --> 00:15:47.626
You told me yourself you're not
comfortable with being just a housewife.

200
00:15:47.667 --> 00:15:49.290
When actually...

201
00:15:50.403 --> 00:15:52.195
-Shit.
-What?

202
00:15:54.518 --> 00:15:57.605
That's Bram, how come he's here?

203
00:15:57.647 --> 00:15:59.976
That's Bram who had a crush on you?

204
00:16:00.627 --> 00:16:04.006
He's handsome. Seem like a nice person.

205
00:16:04.319 --> 00:16:05.781
He's nice, handsome.

206
00:16:06.393 --> 00:16:09.518
But I'm not feeling it,
I can't imagine my life with him.

207
00:16:09.567 --> 00:16:11.087
He's coming here.

208
00:16:14.087 --> 00:16:18.346
-Hi, Di. How are you?
-Good.

209
00:16:18.387 --> 00:16:21.724
This is Kirana,
my friend from high school.

210
00:16:21.766 --> 00:16:23.486
Hi. I'm Bram.

211
00:16:23.527 --> 00:16:25.367
-Kirana.
-Nice to meet you.

212
00:16:26.287 --> 00:16:31.287
By the way, you're much prettier
after getting back from Europe.

213
00:16:31.947 --> 00:16:37.407
My invitation for dinner is still on,
please reply.

214
00:16:40.369 --> 00:16:43.994
Bram is really a match for you.
What are you waiting for?

215
00:16:44.385 --> 00:16:47.093
Afraid of becoming just a housewife like me?

216
00:16:47.147 --> 00:16:50.230
If having a kids like Rega and Windy
won't be a problem for me.

217
00:16:51.134 --> 00:16:53.092
Take the kids to my new apartment.

218
00:16:53.127 --> 00:16:54.526
Another new apartment?

219
00:16:54.567 --> 00:16:55.867
Indra is here.

220
00:16:58.647 --> 00:17:00.669
-Hi, Ndra.
-Hi, Ms. Kirana.

221
00:17:00.711 --> 00:17:01.878
You didn't forget the file, right?

222
00:17:02.866 --> 00:17:05.241
You forgot? How could you?

223
00:17:05.287 --> 00:17:09.745
I'm sorry,
I already asked Inge to bring it.

224
00:17:10.307 --> 00:17:14.307
Your tie is crooked, not matching too.
An embarrassment in the front of client.

225
00:17:19.987 --> 00:17:23.279
-Oh, my God. Yes.
-You forget?

226
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:29.775
Sorry.

227
00:17:31.067 --> 00:17:35.354
Your invitation, also the souvenirs,
I forgot.

228
00:17:35.396 --> 00:17:36.521
Thanks, Ndra.

229
00:17:36.562 --> 00:17:39.101
Please come
to the Student Council reunion.

230
00:17:39.147 --> 00:17:42.605
Kids from high school.
And I will be there, it will be great.

231
00:17:42.967 --> 00:17:47.306
By the way, if the tie is dark blue,
it would be cooler.

232
00:17:47.347 --> 00:17:49.686
Is that so? Thank you, Mrs. Kirana.

233
00:17:50.212 --> 00:17:53.504
-Ndra, hurry, we're late.
-Excuse me, Mrs. Kirana.

234
00:17:58.265 --> 00:17:59.848
-Bye, Na.
-Bye, Di.

235
00:18:12.564 --> 00:18:15.439
Finally, you two came! Na!

236
00:18:16.433 --> 00:18:17.433
Ben.

237
00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:23.186
-You're so beautiful, Na.
-Thank you.

238
00:18:23.227 --> 00:18:25.740
Ben, let me borrow her a while.

239
00:18:25.782 --> 00:18:27.657
We're going to meet everyone else.
Come on.

240
00:18:28.307 --> 00:18:29.986
-Hi.
-Hey, Ben!

241
00:18:30.027 --> 00:18:33.819
I'm happy you finally came. It's nice.

242
00:18:38.927 --> 00:18:40.507
I just fired him.

243
00:18:41.067 --> 00:18:43.447
Not cool, he made an appointment
with the client...

244
00:18:43.489 --> 00:18:44.489
very early in the morning.

245
00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:47.050
He knows that tonight
we're having a party.

246
00:18:47.987 --> 00:18:51.886
-Poor Indra.
-Why? You make me look like the bad guy.

247
00:18:51.927 --> 00:18:54.421
If you worked with him,
you'll not stand him either.

248
00:18:54.463 --> 00:18:56.254
You'll definitely fire him too.

249
00:18:58.283 --> 00:19:02.116
-Do you remember him?
-Tama?

250
00:19:02.392 --> 00:19:03.809
Tamtama Ekaputra.

251
00:19:04.418 --> 00:19:07.218
He is the most promising
young politician.

252
00:19:07.644 --> 00:19:10.394
Didn't he repeats his class twice?

253
00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:11.815
The past is not important.

254
00:19:11.856 --> 00:19:15.273
The most important thing now
is that he have 4,3 millions followers.

255
00:19:15.314 --> 00:19:20.481
He is the candidate
for Jakarta's vice governor.

256
00:19:21.165 --> 00:19:23.342
Wasn't he
a Student Council committee too?

257
00:19:23.384 --> 00:19:25.415
Because he'd want to be with you.

258
00:19:25.467 --> 00:19:27.666
Can you imagine if you're with him?

259
00:19:28.086 --> 00:19:31.919
Probably your name
is not Kirana Permatasari.

260
00:19:31.947 --> 00:19:33.606
But Kirana Ekaputra.

261
00:19:33.929 --> 00:19:36.512
You're not the wife of car salesman.

262
00:19:36.567 --> 00:19:40.339
But the wife of future
Jakarta's vice governor.

263
00:19:40.381 --> 00:19:42.464
Isn't that cool? Right?

264
00:19:50.987 --> 00:19:52.487
He's waving at you, right?

265
00:19:55.847 --> 00:19:57.159
So, how is it?

266
00:19:58.277 --> 00:20:01.068
-Kirana!
-Kirana!

267
00:20:01.483 --> 00:20:03.316
You're so pretty.

268
00:20:03.737 --> 00:20:05.987
It's been a long time.

269
00:20:06.606 --> 00:20:08.481
Where have you been?

270
00:20:08.522 --> 00:20:10.897
You've been absent twice,
and now you came.

271
00:20:10.947 --> 00:20:15.246
Yeah, if we know you'd come,
we'll wear the same costume, princesses!

272
00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:19.657
It doesn't matter, the important thing
is all the Screaming Queens are here!

273
00:20:20.807 --> 00:20:25.026
By the way, I've something to do there.
I'll be right back soon.

274
00:20:25.067 --> 00:20:27.286
We don't even make a boomerang
for Instagram story.

275
00:20:27.327 --> 00:20:28.806
Just because
she's the chairman of committee.

276
00:20:28.847 --> 00:20:31.126
Where have you been all this time?

277
00:20:31.167 --> 00:20:32.084
Did you know?

278
00:20:32.125 --> 00:20:37.041
Diana said she's a PR consultant
in a well-known company.

279
00:20:37.082 --> 00:20:39.581
And she had a lot of clients.

280
00:20:39.627 --> 00:20:42.186
Why you said nothing
when we met at the school?

281
00:20:42.227 --> 00:20:46.144
Do you know? She still manages
to take the kids to school.

282
00:20:46.185 --> 00:20:48.685
-Oh, dear!
-Oh, my God!

283
00:20:48.726 --> 00:20:50.934
I'm so sure...

284
00:20:54.196 --> 00:20:55.240
Diana.

285
00:20:58.291 --> 00:20:59.999
I'll go over there.

286
00:21:00.027 --> 00:21:03.046
-Why do you have to lie?
-Lie?

287
00:21:03.235 --> 00:21:06.318
Yes, you said
that I'm a successful PR consultant.

288
00:21:06.347 --> 00:21:10.407
Do you want me to say
that you're just a housewife. No, right?

289
00:21:11.247 --> 00:21:17.507
-What's wrong with that?
-They will look down on you.

290
00:21:18.807 --> 00:21:22.606
Come on, it's okay, this is reunion.
No problem.

291
00:21:22.647 --> 00:21:25.346
Reunion is all about lie,
all about bragging.

292
00:21:25.736 --> 00:21:28.236
So, you don't need to feel bad about it.

293
00:21:30.807 --> 00:21:33.266
-Kirana.
-Tama.

294
00:21:34.418 --> 00:21:37.835
I think the event is about to start,
I'm going in.

295
00:21:43.927 --> 00:21:48.135
The only alumni that I'm waiting
for the most are you.

296
00:21:48.609 --> 00:21:53.650
I'd like to say thank you for
our time together in Student Council.

297
00:21:53.687 --> 00:21:56.846
It made me what I am today.

298
00:21:58.008 --> 00:22:02.717
I heard that you are
a successful PR consultant, right?

299
00:22:03.207 --> 00:22:05.749
We are all proud of you here, Kirana.

300
00:22:06.727 --> 00:22:11.286
You must have heard
I'm going as a vice governor candidate.

301
00:22:11.835 --> 00:22:17.585
And I need a good campaign manager
and I'm sure it's you.

302
00:22:18.687 --> 00:22:19.948
Profesionally.

303
00:22:20.423 --> 00:22:24.298
How much do you want, just say it.
After all, the party is paying.

304
00:22:26.207 --> 00:22:28.748
Tama, wait a minute, I need to go.

305
00:22:29.357 --> 00:22:32.232
Kirana, can I have your name card?

306
00:22:36.267 --> 00:22:39.587
Sit. Yes, you.

307
00:22:40.207 --> 00:22:41.124
Sit.

308
00:22:49.327 --> 00:22:52.667
Your face looks gloomy, can I help you?

309
00:22:54.247 --> 00:22:55.886
I don't need any help, Mbok.

310
00:22:55.927 --> 00:22:59.057
Mbok? When did I marry your father?

311
00:22:59.099 --> 00:23:00.605
It's Madam.

312
00:23:01.804 --> 00:23:04.554
-What is your name, Child?
-Kirana.

313
00:23:06.282 --> 00:23:10.907
Kirana. There's a cloud in your heart.

314
00:23:12.167 --> 00:23:16.209
A dark fog covered your life.

315
00:23:16.925 --> 00:23:18.532
Pick a card.

316
00:23:19.257 --> 00:23:21.799
No, I don't need a prophecy.

317
00:23:30.199 --> 00:23:34.491
-What are your regrets in life?
-Regrets? I don't...

318
00:23:40.947 --> 00:23:44.655
There's no human without regrets.
What is your regrets in your career?

319
00:23:45.024 --> 00:23:47.649
-I don't have a career.
-Housewife.

320
00:23:48.107 --> 00:23:52.347
Then you have regrets
in your household life now, Kirana.

321
00:23:53.079 --> 00:23:54.329
Pick a second card.

322
00:24:00.059 --> 00:24:05.059
It's bad.
What's your deepest desires, Kirana?

323
00:24:06.467 --> 00:24:10.217
-What do you mean?
-If only... Follow my words.

324
00:24:10.769 --> 00:24:14.561
-If only... Kirana, follow my words.
-What do you mean?

325
00:24:14.607 --> 00:24:18.086
If only when I graduated
from Communication,...

326
00:24:18.127 --> 00:24:23.586
I did not get married immediately,
but I started my career...

327
00:24:23.627 --> 00:24:26.406
-and pursue my dreams.
-Which is?

328
00:24:26.447 --> 00:24:28.976
Become a great PR consultant,...

329
00:24:29.018 --> 00:24:31.746
no need to bother
taking care of the child and husband,...

330
00:24:31.787 --> 00:24:35.037
have a lot of money,
live in a luxury apartment...

331
00:24:37.262 --> 00:24:39.790
No, it's just a joke.

332
00:24:39.832 --> 00:24:44.262
It's just a foolish dream, Madam.

333
00:24:51.475 --> 00:24:54.850
Don't judge me.
You don't know me at all.

334
00:24:55.431 --> 00:24:58.881
One's desires must be revealed
once in a while.

335
00:24:58.923 --> 00:25:00.847
Must be done once in a while.

336
00:25:02.667 --> 00:25:04.834
Open the last card, Kirana.

337
00:25:11.366 --> 00:25:13.245
Before the day change.

338
00:25:13.287 --> 00:25:14.938
Back to the starting point.

339
00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:17.073
Afterward, there's no return.

340
00:25:17.767 --> 00:25:18.887
What's the meaning of this?

341
00:25:19.767 --> 00:25:24.087
Later you will understand.
Save it and open again later.

342
00:25:24.425 --> 00:25:30.175
If the card is black,
then be grateful for your current life.

343
00:25:30.727 --> 00:25:35.987
If the card is red,
your wish is fulfilled, Kirana.

344
00:25:38.647 --> 00:25:39.993
Kirana.

345
00:25:40.875 --> 00:25:41.917
Ben.

346
00:25:45.093 --> 00:25:48.760
They have been looking for you.
Come on, it's going to start.

347
00:25:50.685 --> 00:25:53.726
(Guest List, Kirana)

348
00:25:58.202 --> 00:25:59.369
Ben.

349
00:26:21.608 --> 00:26:22.928
Miss Kirana.

350
00:26:25.195 --> 00:26:27.237
Still sleepy, Ben.

351
00:26:28.229 --> 00:26:29.521
I'm Indra, Miss.

352
00:26:35.412 --> 00:26:38.545
What are you doing in my room?

353
00:26:39.999 --> 00:26:41.291
Last night you said,...

354
00:26:41.347 --> 00:26:46.006
"Ndra, there's a coodination meeting
tomorrow. Wake me up at 06.30."

355
00:26:46.047 --> 00:26:49.446
-Where is this?
-Your apartment, of course.

356
00:26:50.484 --> 00:26:53.275
Apartment? Where's my children?

357
00:26:54.201 --> 00:26:57.909
Children? You're not married yet,
how come you have children?

358
00:26:57.927 --> 00:26:59.469
What are you, a turkey?

359
00:27:03.962 --> 00:27:05.045
Miss...

360
00:27:18.547 --> 00:27:20.047
This is not a dream, right?

361
00:27:24.767 --> 00:27:28.347
Wow. This is real.

362
00:27:43.418 --> 00:27:49.210
If the card is black,
then be grateful for your current life.

363
00:27:49.667 --> 00:27:55.125
If the card is red,
your wish is fulfilled, Kirana.

364
00:27:57.087 --> 00:27:58.246
So...

365
00:27:59.249 --> 00:28:06.041
So, all of my wishes are fulfilled?
This is all real?

366
00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:11.899
This is not a dream.

367
00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:19.730
-How is it, Ndra?
-What?

368
00:28:19.771 --> 00:28:23.771
-How do I look?
-This is how you look everyday.

369
00:28:25.187 --> 00:28:26.709
This is your breakfast.

370
00:28:28.513 --> 00:28:29.555
Only this?

371
00:28:29.907 --> 00:28:31.324
Healthy food.

372
00:28:32.419 --> 00:28:35.328
I'll brief you before meeting
with Tama's campaign team.

373
00:28:36.387 --> 00:28:39.692
Tama? Tamtama Ekaputra?

374
00:28:40.417 --> 00:28:42.167
-That's our client?
-Yes.

375
00:28:44.167 --> 00:28:45.251
Wait a minute.

376
00:28:48.433 --> 00:28:53.391
This is serious? I'm meeting Mr. Jokowi?

377
00:28:54.679 --> 00:28:57.887
-I'm so cool.
-Please take a look at this.

378
00:29:00.087 --> 00:29:03.708
-Do you want to eat here or in the car?
-I want lontong sayur, Ndra.

379
00:29:04.662 --> 00:29:05.746
Okay.

380
00:29:11.316 --> 00:29:14.816
-So, which car do you want to use today?
-What do you mean?

381
00:29:14.847 --> 00:29:20.972
Yes, do you want that car, this,
this little one, or that?

382
00:29:23.057 --> 00:29:26.182
-These are all mine?
-Of course.

383
00:29:27.688 --> 00:29:31.229
Excuse me, Ma'am,
which car will you use?

384
00:29:31.947 --> 00:29:37.655
Ndra, all my cars are cool,
too bad the driver isn't cool too.

385
00:30:02.447 --> 00:30:06.420
Ndra, this big building is rented,
right?

386
00:30:06.918 --> 00:30:10.293
Rented? The whole building is yours.

387
00:30:11.267 --> 00:30:13.736
Did you forget you're the CEO?

388
00:30:15.492 --> 00:30:16.575
Let's go.

389
00:30:18.467 --> 00:30:19.760
Good morning, Miss.

390
00:30:20.858 --> 00:30:22.191
Oops, I'm sorry.

391
00:30:26.227 --> 00:30:28.310
-You...
-Yes, Miss?

392
00:30:29.081 --> 00:30:30.539
Your tie is crooked.

393
00:30:31.535 --> 00:30:32.910
Let me fix it.

394
00:30:33.987 --> 00:30:35.862
See. Looks good, isn't it?

395
00:30:41.715 --> 00:30:42.883
Good morning, Miss.

396
00:30:44.976 --> 00:30:46.643
Is there something wrong with me, Miss?

397
00:30:47.982 --> 00:30:51.482
-Your batik is pretty.
-Thank you, Miss.

398
00:30:55.032 --> 00:30:56.199
I'm so sorry!

399
00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:00.781
-This are the files that you asked.
-Okay. Here you go, Ndra.

400
00:31:01.904 --> 00:31:05.445
Next time you don't need to rush,
just relax.

401
00:31:07.887 --> 00:31:13.847
-What's your name?
-Inge, Inge Wisnubrata.

402
00:31:15.847 --> 00:31:18.927
Your secretary.

403
00:31:21.987 --> 00:31:23.310
Are you married?

404
00:31:24.678 --> 00:31:25.761
Not yet.

405
00:31:26.227 --> 00:31:28.185
-Boyfriend?
-No.

406
00:31:29.206 --> 00:31:32.134
Looks like Indra have a crush on you.

407
00:31:32.814 --> 00:31:34.647
He said you're beautiful.

408
00:31:36.547 --> 00:31:39.398
-Thank you, Miss Kirana.
-Why do you thank me?

409
00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.273
Tell that to the one who said it.

410
00:31:43.195 --> 00:31:44.564
Thank you, Ndra.

411
00:31:47.058 --> 00:31:48.141
Thank you, Ndra.

412
00:31:48.683 --> 00:31:52.558
-Answer when someone's talking to you.
-Yes, your welcome.

413
00:31:59.904 --> 00:32:01.071
I'm going to go.

414
00:32:09.527 --> 00:32:13.607
-Good morning, Miss.
-Good morning, All.

415
00:32:16.177 --> 00:32:20.696
Ndra, are they Tama's team or something?

416
00:32:20.738 --> 00:32:22.696
They are all your employees.

417
00:32:26.894 --> 00:32:28.977
Miss, please sit.

418
00:32:41.819 --> 00:32:42.978
Miss.

419
00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:48.795
Okay, we'll start the briefing.

420
00:32:49.765 --> 00:32:53.182
Who wants to start the brief?
Phillip? Okay.

421
00:32:57.827 --> 00:33:01.244
Why are you guys standing up?
Sit down, it's okay.

422
00:33:03.971 --> 00:33:06.006
-Good morning, Everyone.
-Good morning.

423
00:33:06.048 --> 00:33:09.798
-Our client is one of the rising star...
-Wait a minute.

424
00:33:10.819 --> 00:33:12.495
Can you speak Indonesian?

425
00:33:13.095 --> 00:33:18.470
Your english is a little bit off.

426
00:33:19.947 --> 00:33:25.060
So, our client is one
of the most talented rising star...

427
00:33:25.102 --> 00:33:27.769
in the entertainment business.

428
00:33:28.665 --> 00:33:33.332
-Tina Cempaka.
-Wow, Tina Cempaka.

429
00:33:34.177 --> 00:33:39.175
Ndra, cool. She's my favorite actress.

430
00:33:39.217 --> 00:33:40.718
That's so cool.

431
00:33:43.608 --> 00:33:44.816
Go on.

432
00:33:44.847 --> 00:33:48.226
So, thanks to image
that we're developing for her...

433
00:33:48.267 --> 00:33:50.809
Sorry, Ms. Kirana, I'm late.

434
00:33:51.727 --> 00:33:55.166
-Because my children...
-What happen to your children? Sick?

435
00:33:55.779 --> 00:33:57.189
No, Miss.

436
00:33:57.231 --> 00:34:01.237
I had to took care of them first
because suddenly my maid had to go home.

437
00:34:01.279 --> 00:34:04.093
So, I have to take them
to their grandmother.

438
00:34:04.538 --> 00:34:07.747
I know you won't accept
this kind of reason.

439
00:34:09.543 --> 00:34:10.859
How many kids do you have?

440
00:34:11.317 --> 00:34:13.984
-Three, Miss.
-Can I see their pictures?

441
00:34:17.544 --> 00:34:18.919
I have that.

442
00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:27.034
So adorable, cute.
Their cheeks are chubby.

443
00:34:28.307 --> 00:34:32.590
You must be busy, right?
It's a handful for me with two kids.

444
00:34:33.477 --> 00:34:35.986
-Okay, Linda, sit down.
-Thank you, Miss.

445
00:34:36.356 --> 00:34:39.148
Since when does she have two kids?
When did she marry?

446
00:34:39.439 --> 00:34:42.814
I don't know. Maybe she thinks
me and Inge as her children.

447
00:34:43.522 --> 00:34:46.707
Ask her, does she still needs a child?
My mother has passed away.

448
00:34:46.748 --> 00:34:48.248
-Indra.
-Yes, Miss?

449
00:34:48.593 --> 00:34:52.843
Next time, make the meeting at noon.
Poor Linda

450
00:34:54.807 --> 00:34:56.140
Okay, continue.

451
00:34:56.627 --> 00:35:02.030
So, this beauty products
are the number one in Indonesia...

452
00:35:02.072 --> 00:35:03.153
Hold it.

453
00:35:03.657 --> 00:35:09.218
Are there no snacks here?
Combro, misro, or seblak.

454
00:35:09.866 --> 00:35:11.491
It's so empty.

455
00:35:18.107 --> 00:35:19.565
How close is Tama and me?

456
00:35:24.987 --> 00:35:27.479
-You are so happy there.
-Oh, shit.

457
00:35:27.819 --> 00:35:30.027
If Ben saw this, he'll go mad.

458
00:35:30.424 --> 00:35:32.507
-He must be thinking that I'm cheating.
-Ben?

459
00:35:32.567 --> 00:35:35.727
Yes, Ben, my husband,
Benyamin Kristanto.

460
00:35:37.867 --> 00:35:39.647
Oh, right, I'm not married.

461
00:35:41.667 --> 00:35:44.959
You broke up with Ben
when you went to Sydney for college.

462
00:35:45.567 --> 00:35:46.727
I broke up with Ben?

463
00:35:47.047 --> 00:35:48.767
He's heartbroken for two years, Miss.

464
00:35:53.364 --> 00:35:55.531
Miss. Ndra.

465
00:35:56.527 --> 00:35:57.855
Sorry, Miss Kirana.

466
00:35:57.897 --> 00:36:01.106
I just want to remind you
that you have a lunch meeting now.

467
00:36:01.147 --> 00:36:03.688
Another meeting? We just had a meeting.

468
00:36:05.127 --> 00:36:07.326
That was an internal meeting, Miss.

469
00:36:07.686 --> 00:36:10.811
You have appointments
with several clients today.

470
00:36:10.847 --> 00:36:12.367
It's all on the calendar.

471
00:36:20.111 --> 00:36:21.195
This packed?

472
00:36:28.767 --> 00:36:33.198
Oh, my God.
A nonstop meeting, I'm hungry.

473
00:36:33.657 --> 00:36:35.824
I already prepare the food.

474
00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:54.707
-This is the food?
-Yes.

475
00:36:55.447 --> 00:36:58.687
-Why is it like this?
-It's a healthy diet, right?

476
00:36:59.885 --> 00:37:01.719
What is that, Sir?

477
00:37:03.162 --> 00:37:04.266
Nasi Padang, Miss.

478
00:37:04.307 --> 00:37:06.724
Okay, I'll take that,
you have the salad, okay?

479
00:37:07.472 --> 00:37:09.088
I already did salat maghrib, Miss.

480
00:37:11.758 --> 00:37:14.133
-Okay, here you go.
-Are we exchanging foods now?

481
00:37:25.527 --> 00:37:28.302
And the campaign location
like I explained,...

482
00:37:28.344 --> 00:37:30.026
we'll go to this several places.

483
00:37:30.067 --> 00:37:33.609
Including,
we're going to clean the garbage.

484
00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:38.358
So, the image of Mr. Samsul
and Mr. Tama are good.

485
00:37:38.399 --> 00:37:41.263
And hopefully our goals
will be achieved later.

486
00:37:41.305 --> 00:37:43.180
So, this is the end of my presentation.

487
00:37:43.221 --> 00:37:45.846
Hopefully all of you are pleased,
thank you.

488
00:37:53.627 --> 00:37:57.002
Kirana, what a great presentation.

489
00:37:58.189 --> 00:38:01.022
-Yeah, thank you.
-Miss, I'm going over there.

490
00:38:03.539 --> 00:38:06.372
About your idea
of making a youtube content,...

491
00:38:08.767 --> 00:38:10.192
I already hired both of them.

492
00:38:10.234 --> 00:38:13.446
And starting today,
they'll follow everywhere I go.

493
00:38:13.487 --> 00:38:19.106
Oh, right. I was just presenting,
but all the ideas came from Indra.

494
00:38:19.147 --> 00:38:21.147
Your presentations was something.

495
00:38:21.947 --> 00:38:24.706
Because of your presentation,
this is what I am today.

496
00:38:25.272 --> 00:38:26.564
Really?

497
00:38:26.605 --> 00:38:28.999
Yes, you said it to me in Sydney once.

498
00:38:29.622 --> 00:38:31.913
Don't just criticize the government.

499
00:38:31.987 --> 00:38:35.737
If you dare to help,
come down, help them.

500
00:38:37.322 --> 00:38:39.697
-I said that?
-Yes.

501
00:38:40.618 --> 00:38:45.368
Kirana, you're the muse
of my inspiration.

502
00:38:52.307 --> 00:38:54.807
Sorry, Sir. Can you do it once more?

503
00:38:55.402 --> 00:38:56.890
-Why?
-It was blurry.

504
00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.764
Once again, Miss, it's already good.

505
00:39:01.475 --> 00:39:03.100
Stand by, action.

506
00:39:05.407 --> 00:39:08.157
-You're...
-Take it down a little, sorry.

507
00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:09.610
Okay.

508
00:39:09.996 --> 00:39:11.787
You're the muse of my inspiration.

509
00:39:14.294 --> 00:39:15.294
Excuse me.

510
00:39:19.573 --> 00:39:20.906
So, you got it?

511
00:39:21.785 --> 00:39:23.869
I forgot to push the button, Sir.
It wasn't recorded.

512
00:39:26.347 --> 00:39:31.146
It's okay, Sir. We can re-take it,
but can you call her again?

513
00:39:32.815 --> 00:39:33.899
Shit.

514
00:39:44.067 --> 00:39:48.692
-Mom!
-Rega! Windy!

515
00:39:49.767 --> 00:39:53.566
-I miss you so much.
-Me too.

516
00:39:53.607 --> 00:39:59.440
-I miss you guys, too.
-You must be tired. Let me massage you.

517
00:40:04.417 --> 00:40:05.501
Miss.

518
00:40:10.183 --> 00:40:13.308
These are from Mr. Tama.

519
00:40:13.707 --> 00:40:15.307
It's in the lobby.

520
00:40:17.623 --> 00:40:19.248
(Thank you, you are perfect.
Love, Tama.)

521
00:40:19.307 --> 00:40:21.224
Tama is so serious, Ndra.

522
00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:25.723
You should be prepared
to become the wife of vice governor.

523
00:40:26.408 --> 00:40:29.283
-That won't happen.
-Why not?

524
00:40:30.285 --> 00:40:35.368
Because this is not my actual life,
this is only a piece of dream.

525
00:40:35.409 --> 00:40:37.867
A tiny wishful thinking
that become a reality.

526
00:40:38.306 --> 00:40:41.931
I just taste it for a while.
So, I'm not curious anymore.

527
00:40:42.857 --> 00:40:46.982
-All of this are not real, Ndra.
-What's not real, Miss?

528
00:40:47.027 --> 00:40:51.444
Thank you for becoming
a good personal assistant for one day.

529
00:40:52.225 --> 00:40:53.392
Bye bye!

530
00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:57.930
Miss, what do you mean?
I'm not fired, right?

531
00:41:00.396 --> 00:41:01.438
Miss Kirana?

532
00:41:04.124 --> 00:41:09.624
Okay, Madam Sri Menyan,
thank you for the opportunity.

533
00:41:09.647 --> 00:41:13.105
I can enjoy my dreams today.

534
00:41:13.147 --> 00:41:17.188
Let me get back
to my real life tomorrow.

535
00:41:18.002 --> 00:41:21.294
Rega dan Windy
already misses their mother.

536
00:41:56.813 --> 00:41:58.605
Why am I still here?

537
00:42:00.298 --> 00:42:01.467
Miss.

538
00:42:02.374 --> 00:42:06.083
What are you doing here?
I want to go home.

539
00:42:06.664 --> 00:42:11.539
Back home where? To your hometown?
Lebaran isn't near, Miss.

540
00:42:11.879 --> 00:42:15.921
-Besides, people are waiting for you.
-Waiting for me? For what?

541
00:42:16.367 --> 00:42:18.036
There's a press conference at 09.00.

542
00:42:18.078 --> 00:42:19.078
-Hi, Ndra.
-Hi.

543
00:42:19.119 --> 00:42:22.326
-You're here too.
-Yes, you told me to.

544
00:42:22.367 --> 00:42:24.766
"Inge, for the preparation
of the press conference,...

545
00:42:24.807 --> 00:42:26.807
come to my place with Indra."

546
00:42:27.822 --> 00:42:30.697
-What press conference?
-Tina Cempaka, our client, Miss.

547
00:42:30.738 --> 00:42:34.699
Accused as a homewrecker.
Last night, she was bullied by netizen.

548
00:42:37.489 --> 00:42:41.864
-You whore! Sleazy actress!
-What the hell?

549
00:42:42.607 --> 00:42:46.331
If her image is like this, her contract
with the beauty products will be a bust.

550
00:42:46.373 --> 00:42:47.708
Canceled.

551
00:42:48.471 --> 00:42:50.846
Tina Cempaka is a good person.

552
00:42:54.987 --> 00:42:58.126
I know why I'm still here with you.

553
00:42:58.168 --> 00:43:00.293
It means I have to settle this thing
right now.

554
00:43:00.887 --> 00:43:03.087
Okay, we'll do the press conference now.

555
00:43:03.687 --> 00:43:05.955
What should I say to the press, Miss?

556
00:43:05.997 --> 00:43:08.126
I'm tired saying no comments
all the time.

557
00:43:08.167 --> 00:43:09.711
What answer will you give?

558
00:43:10.338 --> 00:43:13.879
Mr. Indra told me to say
that there's nothing between us.

559
00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:15.920
And we're only a good friends.

560
00:43:16.365 --> 00:43:19.532
And all the pictures are hoax,
a photoshop's editing.

561
00:43:19.573 --> 00:43:21.328
That means you're lying?

562
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:25.425
You do have a relationship
with that businessman, right?

563
00:43:26.868 --> 00:43:29.352
-Yeah, but...
-Well, okay.

564
00:43:29.394 --> 00:43:32.435
-Just give a honest answer.
-Seriously, Miss?

565
00:43:36.147 --> 00:43:37.522
Please be quiet, Everyone.

566
00:43:37.563 --> 00:43:38.696
To all fellow media.

567
00:43:38.736 --> 00:43:42.267
Today, Tina Cempaka will give
clarification regarding her scandal.

568
00:43:42.307 --> 00:43:44.932
You once said that establish an image
means creating an illusion.

569
00:43:45.327 --> 00:43:48.006
It's not in accordance with the reality,
no need for that.

570
00:43:48.048 --> 00:43:48.994
So?

571
00:43:49.247 --> 00:43:51.539
How come we told Tina to say the truth?

572
00:43:53.407 --> 00:43:54.907
I'm really nervous, Ndra.

573
00:43:57.083 --> 00:43:58.083
Sorry.

574
00:43:58.347 --> 00:44:01.587
My apologies to Mr. Adrian's family.

575
00:44:02.445 --> 00:44:05.987
Because it has caused chaos
and troubles in his family.

576
00:44:06.028 --> 00:44:07.787
I feel guilty.

577
00:44:08.599 --> 00:44:13.016
And I promised
I will not continue our relationship.

578
00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:15.425
I hope after this...

579
00:44:15.963 --> 00:44:18.963
Mr. Adrian and his family
stay harmonious and happy.

580
00:44:19.256 --> 00:44:20.298
Thank you.

581
00:44:22.027 --> 00:44:23.186
Oh, my God.

582
00:44:24.655 --> 00:44:27.780
Even her acting in a soap opera
isn't this good, Miss.

583
00:44:30.662 --> 00:44:32.391
Miss, you're right. Look at this.

584
00:44:32.838 --> 00:44:35.421
Her Instagram story
gain a lot of positive comments.

585
00:44:35.467 --> 00:44:37.759
-Her haters are quiet.
-You're right.

586
00:44:38.987 --> 00:44:43.209
Women who admit their wrong
and dare to apologize to other women,...

587
00:44:43.251 --> 00:44:45.459
it will bring sympathy from many people.

588
00:44:47.007 --> 00:44:50.507
-Is that so?
-Okay, I have finished my task.

589
00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:54.255
Miss, not yet. You still have meetings.

590
00:44:54.307 --> 00:44:56.640
Miss. Two o'clock meeting at Mulia.

591
00:44:56.681 --> 00:44:59.015
Four o'clock meeting
about Hotel Akasia's new image.

592
00:44:59.056 --> 00:45:01.222
-Six o'clock to the salon and...
-Salon?

593
00:45:01.504 --> 00:45:04.837
Yes, because you want to prepare
for fund raising dinner with Mr. Tama.

594
00:45:04.867 --> 00:45:07.666
You said yourself that you want
to look pretty for Mr. Tama.

595
00:45:07.707 --> 00:45:10.966
A lot of journalists will be there.
Your rumor with Mr. Tama is already out.

596
00:45:11.007 --> 00:45:13.132
Your relationship is special.
Couple of the year.

597
00:45:13.173 --> 00:45:16.660
No, no way.
Inge, just cancel everything.

598
00:45:16.702 --> 00:45:18.114
I want to go home to my house.

599
00:45:19.227 --> 00:45:20.866
I think she means her apartment, right?

600
00:45:21.237 --> 00:45:23.112
Maybe. Come on.

601
00:45:23.384 --> 00:45:24.845
Yeah, I'll go with you.

602
00:45:26.943 --> 00:45:27.943
Come on!

603
00:45:36.847 --> 00:45:38.389
This is Miss Kirana's house?

604
00:45:39.787 --> 00:45:42.706
How come I just found out
that you have a house here?

605
00:45:42.747 --> 00:45:44.706
Take a day off for all of you, okay?

606
00:45:44.747 --> 00:45:48.167
It's up to you, see a movie
or sight seeing, anything.

607
00:45:48.607 --> 00:45:50.167
Go on, have fun.

608
00:45:51.803 --> 00:45:54.303
If you like her, don't hold it back.

609
00:45:56.367 --> 00:45:59.029
Miss, what about tomorrow?

610
00:45:59.930 --> 00:46:03.763
Maybe tomorrow
we won't meet again, Ndra. Bye.

611
00:46:19.007 --> 00:46:22.147
Do you realize
Miss Kirana is acting weird, Inge?

612
00:46:26.971 --> 00:46:28.108
Inge.

613
00:46:29.197 --> 00:46:30.815
To the movie, right? Dinner?

614
00:46:31.848 --> 00:46:32.987
No?

615
00:46:33.748 --> 00:46:36.248
-That's okay.
-Miss Inge.

616
00:46:37.195 --> 00:46:39.445
If you want to watch a movie,
just go with me.

617
00:46:42.407 --> 00:46:45.267
That's a no? It's okay.

618
00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:49.912
Wait a minute.

619
00:46:51.225 --> 00:46:53.184
Just go, but don't touch the window.

620
00:47:00.707 --> 00:47:02.741
Mrs. Diah! Mrs. Diah, you're back.

621
00:47:03.203 --> 00:47:07.370
Oh, my God, I'm happy that you're back!

622
00:47:08.847 --> 00:47:10.037
What's wrong?

623
00:47:10.584 --> 00:47:11.917
Who are you, Ma'am?

624
00:47:13.147 --> 00:47:15.787
Don't you recognize me? I'm Kirana.

625
00:47:16.142 --> 00:47:19.225
This is Benyamin Kristanto's house,
right?

626
00:47:19.787 --> 00:47:22.606
-His children are Rega and Windy.
-That's right.

627
00:47:22.648 --> 00:47:24.008
Who are you, Ma'am?

628
00:47:24.267 --> 00:47:25.642
You're not kidding, right?

629
00:47:28.127 --> 00:47:29.210
Diana.

630
00:47:30.553 --> 00:47:33.178
-Ma'am.
-Diana with Ben?

631
00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:35.330
How come?

632
00:47:39.127 --> 00:47:40.335
How come it's Diana?

633
00:47:43.018 --> 00:47:46.601
Ma'am, who are you? What do you want?

634
00:47:47.407 --> 00:47:51.882
It's not possible, right?
This isn't the reality, right?

635
00:47:52.472 --> 00:47:53.639
I don't want it.

636
00:47:53.967 --> 00:47:57.566
Security!

637
00:47:57.607 --> 00:48:01.466
-Security!
-Mrs. Diah, stop!

638
00:48:01.507 --> 00:48:06.446
Please don't scream. I'll leave,
but you don't need to scream.

639
00:48:06.487 --> 00:48:07.737
I'm not a bad person.

640
00:48:08.427 --> 00:48:11.594
You have to leave now
or I'll also call the police.

641
00:48:12.118 --> 00:48:13.327
Okay, I'll leave.

642
00:48:32.407 --> 00:48:34.207
Kirana Permatasari?

643
00:48:40.187 --> 00:48:43.826
Lidya. Finally someone recognize me.

644
00:48:43.867 --> 00:48:46.526
Of course I know you, we were neighbors.

645
00:48:46.567 --> 00:48:48.525
-Yes, that's right...
-Back in Sydney.

646
00:48:49.442 --> 00:48:50.781
Sydney?

647
00:48:50.822 --> 00:48:53.822
-No, we...
-Yes, in Sydney.

648
00:48:53.863 --> 00:48:56.363
We were in the same dormitory,
only for a while though.

649
00:48:56.404 --> 00:48:58.613
You're too smart,
so you graduated earlier.

650
00:48:58.902 --> 00:49:02.922
But I followed your career.
You're such a great PR.

651
00:49:05.581 --> 00:49:07.956
Where are you going? Let me take you.

652
00:49:08.966 --> 00:49:13.258
Na, you are mentioned
the most bright graduate of Sydney.

653
00:49:13.297 --> 00:49:15.736
You're such a role model
for every girls who thinks of...

654
00:49:15.777 --> 00:49:18.194
How is your baby, healthy?

655
00:49:19.837 --> 00:49:23.197
How did you know? Does it show?

656
00:49:24.979 --> 00:49:28.229
-I'm forced to get pregnant actually.
-Forced?

657
00:49:29.410 --> 00:49:32.118
I wasn't planning to get pregnant now.

658
00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:34.310
But my husband insists...

659
00:49:34.352 --> 00:49:37.143
if I don't want to get pregnant
this year, he wants to get a divorce.

660
00:49:37.490 --> 00:49:40.830
He is very jealous
to see our neighbors in front of us.

661
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:45.493
Ben and Diana?

662
00:49:46.175 --> 00:49:47.800
Yes, you know them?

663
00:49:50.090 --> 00:49:54.507
He really hopes that I'd become
like Diana, the perfect housewife.

664
00:49:54.927 --> 00:49:58.302
Why would he marry me
when he is looking for girls like that?

665
00:50:05.130 --> 00:50:06.172
-I...
-I...

666
00:50:10.090 --> 00:50:12.173
-I'll go first.
-Yes, you go first.

667
00:50:13.443 --> 00:50:17.652
-I really like the movie.
-Me too.

668
00:50:18.571 --> 00:50:20.779
So do I, it was good.

669
00:50:24.450 --> 00:50:26.588
But if I could choose,
I prefer action movies.

670
00:50:27.152 --> 00:50:29.402
Yes, I really love action movies too.

671
00:50:30.089 --> 00:50:31.547
I also like action movies.

672
00:50:37.596 --> 00:50:42.346
-Do you like horror movies?
-I don't like horror, I'm scared.

673
00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:44.169
Unless I watch it with someone.

674
00:50:45.449 --> 00:50:46.907
-I also don't...
-Can you shut up?

675
00:50:53.650 --> 00:50:55.701
Which superheroes do you like?

676
00:50:56.774 --> 00:50:59.357
If it's superheroes, I like Superman.

677
00:50:59.390 --> 00:51:03.015
-Superman?
-Yes, cool, handsome, strong.

678
00:51:03.719 --> 00:51:08.302
Miss, for me, I like Gatotkaca.
He is very strong...

679
00:51:08.343 --> 00:51:10.801
Sir, can you shut up?

680
00:51:13.150 --> 00:51:15.064
-They are on a date.
-Okay.

681
00:51:16.239 --> 00:51:18.156
It's all good. Go on.

682
00:51:20.285 --> 00:51:23.118
-Hello, this is our family activities.
-Hello.

683
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:25.004
Here's our mommy
who is preparing for breakfast.

684
00:51:25.046 --> 00:51:26.775
-Hello, Dear Mommy.
-Hi, Dear.

685
00:51:26.816 --> 00:51:30.676
-The kids are getting ready to school.
-Hello.

686
00:51:31.330 --> 00:51:34.534
Mommy, thank you
for doing my hair like Rihanna.

687
00:51:34.576 --> 00:51:36.443
-Do you like it?
-I like it so much!

688
00:51:36.485 --> 00:51:38.610
-Let's eat breakfast.
-Okay.

689
00:51:38.651 --> 00:51:43.026
-You'll take me to school, right, Dad?
-Of course, you too.

690
00:51:43.067 --> 00:51:44.245
Thank you, Dad!

691
00:51:44.287 --> 00:51:48.048
Of course.
Okay, we're going to eat. Bye!

692
00:52:11.550 --> 00:52:14.043
Let me wash the vegetables.

693
00:52:14.982 --> 00:52:17.732
There was a woman
looking for Mr. Ben, Ma'am.

694
00:52:22.455 --> 00:52:24.494
Woman? Who is it?

695
00:52:25.184 --> 00:52:28.851
Her name is Kirana.

696
00:52:29.568 --> 00:52:30.985
-Kirana?
-Yes.

697
00:52:35.622 --> 00:52:36.683
Here you go, Mrs. Diah.

698
00:52:36.725 --> 00:52:39.433
-Do you want more coffee?
-Sure.

699
00:52:49.085 --> 00:52:53.460
Please, let me go back.

700
00:52:58.447 --> 00:53:02.988
Let me wake in my own room
tomorrow morning.

701
00:53:18.450 --> 00:53:21.344
Sweety, did the children
already go to sleep?

702
00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:23.665
Yes, Dear.

703
00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:29.562
Did you know? Me and my sales team
were called by Mr. Tanoto.

704
00:53:30.850 --> 00:53:33.932
Just like what you suggest me to do,
I protested.

705
00:53:33.974 --> 00:53:35.016
And then?

706
00:53:35.627 --> 00:53:39.252
Mr. Tanoto praise me.
He said that I have big initiative.

707
00:53:39.293 --> 00:53:42.193
And he promote me
as the Head of Strategy.

708
00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:45.510
-Are you serious?
-Serious.

709
00:53:47.062 --> 00:53:48.229
Thank you, Sweety.

710
00:53:51.070 --> 00:53:52.610
I'm proud of you.

711
00:53:58.270 --> 00:54:00.250
I want us to be like this forever.

712
00:54:02.070 --> 00:54:03.612
Where are you going?

713
00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:20.190
I don't want to stay in here!
I want to go home!

714
00:54:41.587 --> 00:54:46.295
Miss. Miss Kirana.
It's been three days you're not working.

715
00:54:46.688 --> 00:54:47.980
Are you ill, Miss?

716
00:54:50.766 --> 00:54:52.808
Go away, Indra!

717
00:56:09.210 --> 00:56:12.252
-Where's Mommy?
-She hasn't arrived yet.

718
00:56:15.623 --> 00:56:19.707
Rega, Windy, you remember me, right?

719
00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:22.233
I miss you so much.

720
00:56:22.498 --> 00:56:23.590
Windy.

721
00:56:24.413 --> 00:56:27.315
-No!
-Let go! Let go of my sister!

722
00:56:27.357 --> 00:56:29.773
-Sir, help! Let go!
-No!

723
00:56:29.814 --> 00:56:31.023
What is going on?

724
00:56:31.064 --> 00:56:35.647
-Sir, let me hug my children.
-Just stop it, Ma'am.

725
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:39.229
-I'm their mother.
-I know who their mother is.

726
00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:42.150
Her name is Mrs. Diana,
she doesn't look like you.

727
00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:08.427
You should go to the office now.

728
00:57:10.203 --> 00:57:11.635
What are you guys doing here?

729
00:57:13.454 --> 00:57:15.995
The office is chaotic
when you are not around.

730
00:57:16.330 --> 00:57:18.955
All clients are angry
because they can't meet you.

731
00:57:18.996 --> 00:57:21.496
All the staff are confused,
no one dares to make a decision.

732
00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:26.183
Do you have the heart
to ruin all of the things you build?

733
00:57:29.042 --> 00:57:31.208
You'll never understand
what I have been through.

734
00:57:31.562 --> 00:57:34.395
Yes, we will not understand
if you don't tell it to us.

735
00:57:34.942 --> 00:57:39.922
Useless. You're not going to believe it.
Just go.

736
00:57:40.602 --> 00:57:44.101
Miss, I can't go back to the office
if you're not there.

737
00:57:44.142 --> 00:57:45.517
Yes, me too, Miss.

738
00:57:52.162 --> 00:57:53.161
Okay.

739
00:57:54.601 --> 00:57:56.607
If that's what you want,...

740
00:57:58.105 --> 00:57:59.813
we'll go to the office now.

741
00:58:03.307 --> 00:58:06.680
-Are you going to work or talk?
-Morning, Miss.

742
00:58:06.722 --> 00:58:09.807
What are you smiling for?
Your tie is crooked.

743
00:58:11.302 --> 00:58:15.461
We are working in a PR consultant.
Image is everything, all of it.

744
00:58:15.502 --> 00:58:18.191
That's what makes our living,
what we sale.

745
00:58:18.233 --> 00:58:20.994
Pay attention to your image.

746
00:58:21.036 --> 00:58:24.261
Clothes, attitude, pay attention!
Do not embarrass this office!

747
00:58:24.528 --> 00:58:25.903
Everybody understand?

748
00:58:26.674 --> 00:58:29.633
-Do you understand?
-Yes, Ma'am.

749
00:58:30.362 --> 00:58:33.008
Where's Inge?
Why is she taking so long in the toilet?

750
00:58:33.737 --> 00:58:34.862
Call her.

751
00:58:35.806 --> 00:58:36.890
Call her!

752
00:58:43.422 --> 00:58:46.963
Because this year's growth chart
are decreasing,...

753
00:58:47.004 --> 00:58:50.088
we decided to increase...

754
00:58:51.902 --> 00:58:54.693
Chew. Keep chewing.

755
00:58:56.267 --> 00:58:57.267
Are you done?

756
00:58:57.642 --> 00:59:01.522
Starting now, there's no snacks
on the table. Understand?

757
00:59:02.521 --> 00:59:04.771
I'm sorry, Miss. I'm late.

758
00:59:09.362 --> 00:59:14.362
Children excuses again?
If you can't do both, stays home.

759
00:59:14.403 --> 00:59:16.653
-Just be a housewife.
-Yes, Miss.

760
00:59:17.301 --> 00:59:20.301
-How come she turns evil like this?
-I don't know.

761
00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:23.499
We need Mr. Tama. Tamtama Effect.

762
00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:26.700
-If you want to date, go outside.
-Yes, Miss, I'm sorry.

763
00:59:31.601 --> 00:59:34.374
What's with the silent?
What did I just said?

764
00:59:34.416 --> 00:59:36.642
No more snacks, clean it up!

765
00:59:39.102 --> 00:59:40.685
Our time is tight.

766
00:59:47.222 --> 00:59:49.972
Kirana. Surprise.

767
00:59:50.014 --> 00:59:53.501
Tama? How did you get here?

768
00:59:53.542 --> 00:59:57.125
Yes, I got your apartment's access
from Indra.

769
00:59:58.582 --> 01:00:01.707
I have a surprise. Special dinner.

770
01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:13.597
Thank you for the
dinner, I'm so surprised.

771
01:00:14.282 --> 01:00:16.365
But I need to be alone.

772
01:00:16.422 --> 01:00:20.543
Yes, you should relax more. Okay?

773
01:00:22.662 --> 01:00:24.954
That's why I need to rest.

774
01:00:25.779 --> 01:00:27.382
So, please go home, okay?

775
01:00:29.176 --> 01:00:30.634
Then how about the dinner?

776
01:00:30.682 --> 01:00:33.262
I will eat it later, I promise.

777
01:00:42.062 --> 01:00:43.342
You should eat.

778
01:00:52.322 --> 01:00:55.405
-Surprise, Miss, we're the same.
-Surprise, Miss, we're the same.

779
01:00:55.927 --> 01:00:59.843
Miss, may I go too? I'm tired too.

780
01:01:01.188 --> 01:01:03.732
But before that,
any message for our YouTube viewers?

781
01:01:03.774 --> 01:01:04.899
Go.

782
01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:06.880
You're so wise, Miss.

783
01:01:10.122 --> 01:01:11.502
Subscribe.

784
01:01:15.402 --> 01:01:16.636
Morning.

785
01:01:17.146 --> 01:01:20.104
You're late. What kind of socks is that?

786
01:01:20.145 --> 01:01:23.228
It isn't matched,
embarrassment to clients.

787
01:01:24.222 --> 01:01:26.097
Oh, right, one more thing.

788
01:01:26.986 --> 01:01:28.061
Pick it up.

789
01:01:29.191 --> 01:01:31.983
Never give your access key to anyone.

790
01:01:32.022 --> 01:01:34.951
Not even that future vice governor,
understand?

791
01:01:35.711 --> 01:01:36.836
Yes, Miss.

792
01:01:54.795 --> 01:01:55.920
What is it?

793
01:02:01.085 --> 01:02:05.210
-Today's schedule, Miss.
-Give it, let me look at it myself.

794
01:02:07.918 --> 01:02:09.751
You should arrange it right.

795
01:02:09.793 --> 01:02:12.875
Why is the schedule so packed?
Am I robot?

796
01:02:13.342 --> 01:02:17.742
-Yes, I thought usually...
-Don't just think, use your heart!

797
01:02:18.902 --> 01:02:20.119
What is this?

798
01:02:20.722 --> 01:02:23.056
I was invited to be a speaker
at Budi Pekerti Elementary School?

799
01:02:23.102 --> 01:02:26.962
-No, Miss, it was canceled by Indra.
-Why did you canceled it?

800
01:02:28.522 --> 01:02:32.442
-Indra!
-Yes, Miss.

801
01:02:33.775 --> 01:02:36.442
I have a schedule
at Budi Pekerti Elementary School.

802
01:02:36.483 --> 01:02:40.524
There was a student's parents
that recommended you.

803
01:02:40.565 --> 01:02:43.025
But I know you wouldn't go,
so I canceled.

804
01:02:43.782 --> 01:02:46.365
That is my children's school!

805
01:02:47.338 --> 01:02:49.755
Inge, hurry,
call the headmistress, Mrs. Rhonda.

806
01:02:49.782 --> 01:02:52.022
Tell her I'll come as a speaker there.

807
01:02:53.402 --> 01:02:54.777
Hurry up!

808
01:03:06.362 --> 01:03:09.981
-Diana.
-Kirana?

809
01:03:10.022 --> 01:03:13.642
Oh, my God, you look different.
I barely recognized you.

810
01:03:14.402 --> 01:03:18.961
This is my friend from high school,
her name's Mrs. Kirana.

811
01:03:19.002 --> 01:03:22.962
-You look like...
-Rega, Windy.

812
01:03:28.642 --> 01:03:30.704
Ma'am.

813
01:03:32.349 --> 01:03:35.390
I think I saw you, but where?

814
01:03:35.681 --> 01:03:39.786
Everywhere,
I'm a well known public figure.

815
01:03:39.828 --> 01:03:41.848
So, you must have seen me.

816
01:03:41.902 --> 01:03:46.721
-Wow, actress.
-Miss Kirana, welcome.

817
01:03:46.762 --> 01:03:53.581
-Mrs. Rhonda, sorry I'm late.
-It's okay, I was confused...

818
01:03:53.622 --> 01:03:57.137
in finding an alternative speaker.

819
01:03:57.179 --> 01:04:01.185
But now you're here to be a speaker
for our children.

820
01:04:02.042 --> 01:04:06.162
It's okay, I'm happy to share
my experience as a PR consultant.

821
01:04:06.502 --> 01:04:08.541
Especially for girls.

822
01:04:08.582 --> 01:04:12.832
They must know since early on
that they should not be narrow-minded.

823
01:04:13.168 --> 01:04:15.918
Satisfied only in being
an ordinary housewife.

824
01:04:16.996 --> 01:04:21.746
While today women
must have high career and success.

825
01:04:21.802 --> 01:04:24.093
So, we're the same as men.

826
01:04:24.744 --> 01:04:27.301
-What did you want to say?
-I want...

827
01:04:27.342 --> 01:04:31.883
Being a housewife is a choice,
not a matter of narrow or broad mind.

828
01:04:31.924 --> 01:04:34.284
-But...
-Interesting discussion.

829
01:04:34.326 --> 01:04:35.864
What time is it?

830
01:04:36.931 --> 01:04:39.639
Ma'am, the children are waiting
in class. Please.

831
01:04:40.022 --> 01:04:42.201
Rega, Windy, please go to your class.

832
01:04:42.242 --> 01:04:45.462
-I will pick you later.
-Okay, Mommy, bye.

833
01:04:46.062 --> 01:04:49.901
Mrs. Diana, I'd like to speak with you
in my office, I'll wait.

834
01:04:50.254 --> 01:04:53.421
-Please, Ms. Kirana
-Ms. Kirana.

835
01:04:53.482 --> 01:04:57.382
Diana, if Mrs. Rhonda mention
about Rega's grades that goes down,...

836
01:04:57.762 --> 01:05:00.220
please told her that he is dyslexia.

837
01:05:01.282 --> 01:05:02.573
Please, Ms. Kirana.

838
01:05:07.142 --> 01:05:12.801
Okay, my job is called
public relation consultant.

839
01:05:13.089 --> 01:05:18.065
So my job is to make people
looks cooler.

840
01:05:18.107 --> 01:05:20.357
So, a lot of people will like them.

841
01:05:20.722 --> 01:05:25.847
Miss, you're the same as my mom.
My mom makes me look cool.

842
01:05:25.888 --> 01:05:28.208
She does my hair like Rihanna.

843
01:05:32.222 --> 01:05:34.461
My mom too, Miss.

844
01:05:34.502 --> 01:05:36.943
In order my friends to like me,...

845
01:05:36.985 --> 01:05:40.541
I bring more food to school
to share with my friends.

846
01:05:40.582 --> 01:05:45.457
-Right.
-Kids.

847
01:05:45.498 --> 01:05:51.581
So, what your parents do
is different from me.

848
01:05:51.622 --> 01:05:57.699
To achieve it, I am hired,
I am getting paid.

849
01:05:57.741 --> 01:05:59.918
That means you are a bad person!

850
01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:03.640
People ask for help,
but you're asking them for payment!

851
01:06:03.667 --> 01:06:06.167
-You're mean!
-Mean!

852
01:06:06.228 --> 01:06:09.603
You're not sincere,
my mom helps me sincerely .

853
01:06:09.661 --> 01:06:13.494
-Yes!
-Yes!

854
01:06:13.535 --> 01:06:16.869
It's not like that.
Please listen to me. It's not like that.

855
01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:20.410
Why can't you be quiet? Please be quiet.

856
01:06:20.451 --> 01:06:23.326
Be quiet!

857
01:06:32.214 --> 01:06:33.379
Na.

858
01:06:35.811 --> 01:06:37.353
-Diana.
-How is it?

859
01:06:38.095 --> 01:06:41.512
-The class went well?
-It went...

860
01:06:47.494 --> 01:06:50.758
It went well. All the kids liked it.

861
01:06:51.545 --> 01:06:53.378
-Especially Windy.
-Really?

862
01:06:54.313 --> 01:07:00.521
How about you? Have you met Mrs. Rhonda?
You told her Rega is dyslexia?

863
01:07:00.562 --> 01:07:01.520
I did.

864
01:07:03.413 --> 01:07:07.163
Mrs. Rhonda actually praised Windy's
and Rega's achievements at school.

865
01:07:07.693 --> 01:07:12.112
In fact, she asked me
to make some kind of seminar or class...

866
01:07:12.153 --> 01:07:14.944
for mothers
how to teach children at home.

867
01:07:16.113 --> 01:07:18.616
Oh, right, would you
like to have dinner at my house?

868
01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:20.118
Dinner?

869
01:07:20.833 --> 01:07:25.014
Actually it's Ben's idea.
I told him if I met you here.

870
01:07:25.056 --> 01:07:29.306
Then Ben says, why not invite
you and Tama dinner at home tonight?

871
01:07:29.973 --> 01:07:31.138
Tama?

872
01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:34.013
Everyone knows
about your relationship with Tama.

873
01:07:34.054 --> 01:07:35.971
Everybody is talking about it
on Instagram.

874
01:07:41.473 --> 01:07:44.488
Tama said okay. Ben chat with him.

875
01:07:44.530 --> 01:07:47.832
Lately, Ben and Tama
often communicate.

876
01:07:48.372 --> 01:07:50.539
Tama buys several cars from Ben.

877
01:07:51.753 --> 01:07:56.419
So tonight we have dinner,
I will cook something special for you.

878
01:07:57.255 --> 01:07:59.714
You can cook?

879
01:08:05.853 --> 01:08:08.412
Good evening. We're so happy.

880
01:08:08.798 --> 01:08:14.173
Our humble home is visited by candidate
for vice governor and his partner.

881
01:08:16.393 --> 01:08:19.712
As advised by my personal consultant.

882
01:08:19.753 --> 01:08:24.173
She said no matter how,
I have to gather votes.

883
01:08:25.793 --> 01:08:28.456
Don't worry, Tama.
Ben and I will definitely vote for you.

884
01:08:28.498 --> 01:08:30.393
-Yes.
-Where's Ben?

885
01:08:30.907 --> 01:08:32.907
Ben is inside, preparing the dinner.

886
01:08:33.893 --> 01:08:39.268
Rega, Windy, come here.
They're friends of mom and dad.

887
01:08:39.693 --> 01:08:44.593
This is Mr. Tama and Ms. Kirana.
You remember, right? Go greet them.

888
01:08:47.133 --> 01:08:49.424
Why didn't you greet them?

889
01:08:50.193 --> 01:08:54.478
I don't want to,
Ms. Kirana was mean at school.

890
01:08:56.254 --> 01:09:01.625
Why did you say that? She's not mean.
Now go greet her.

891
01:09:01.667 --> 01:09:03.047
All right.

892
01:09:06.165 --> 01:09:10.290
-Hi. You're smart, Beautiful.
-Okay, go to your room.

893
01:09:10.331 --> 01:09:11.373
Okay.

894
01:09:12.642 --> 01:09:15.142
Sis, mommy friend's mustache
is so tacky.

895
01:09:17.973 --> 01:09:20.752
-Sorry, you know kids.
-It's okay.

896
01:09:21.798 --> 01:09:23.757
-Let's go inside.
-Let's go.

897
01:09:27.733 --> 01:09:31.892
Here you go,
this is roast chicken ala Diana.

898
01:09:31.934 --> 01:09:34.684
Wow, looks delicious

899
01:09:35.513 --> 01:09:36.898
You're great, Diana.

900
01:09:37.381 --> 01:09:40.590
Thanks to Ben, he always said
that my cooking was delicious.

901
01:09:40.631 --> 01:09:43.910
So, I was motivated
to try all kinds of cooking.

902
01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:47.796
Yes, but my taste bud and theirs
are not the same.

903
01:09:48.132 --> 01:09:50.405
If it doesn't taste good, just say so.

904
01:09:50.447 --> 01:09:52.423
-That's okay, right, Sweety?
-It's okay, Dear.

905
01:09:56.173 --> 01:09:58.552
Oh, right, the kids doesn't eat?

906
01:09:58.593 --> 01:10:02.153
The kids already ate.
They're doing homeworks at their room.

907
01:10:03.255 --> 01:10:08.505
-Sweety, where's the water?
-I forgot, let me get it.

908
01:10:09.002 --> 01:10:10.460
Wait, let me.

909
01:10:14.346 --> 01:10:18.679
-Right, sorry old habit.
-It's okay, I often forget too.

910
01:10:18.733 --> 01:10:22.733
But since you're a special guests,
let me prepare it.

911
01:10:25.173 --> 01:10:28.298
-Come, please.
-Let's eat, I'm hungry.

912
01:10:41.821 --> 01:10:44.389
-Don't bother.
-It's okay.

913
01:10:44.431 --> 01:10:46.570
Official's duty is to serve.

914
01:10:53.453 --> 01:10:56.029
It's so incredible.

915
01:10:56.527 --> 01:11:00.277
Thank you for having us, Ben, Diana.

916
01:11:00.313 --> 01:11:01.563
We are the one who grateful...

917
01:11:01.605 --> 01:11:04.433
having special guests,
future vice governor and future wife.

918
01:11:07.881 --> 01:11:09.840
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

919
01:11:10.748 --> 01:11:13.139
Excuse me for a moment,
I'm putting the kids to bed.

920
01:11:13.181 --> 01:11:15.306
-Me?
-Oh, you.

921
01:11:16.253 --> 01:11:18.183
-Excuse me.
-Yes, Sweety.

922
01:11:19.987 --> 01:11:21.862
Right, Tam,
there's coffee, sugar or no sugar?

923
01:11:21.903 --> 01:11:25.278
-With sugar please.
-As sweet as your fate getting Kirana.

924
01:11:25.319 --> 01:11:27.979
-Ouch.
-In a minute.

925
01:11:30.313 --> 01:11:36.188
They're so awesome.
Profile of a harmonious young couple.

926
01:11:39.790 --> 01:11:44.706
-I want someday we could...
-I'll help them clean up.

927
01:11:53.073 --> 01:11:54.323
Hello, yes, Mr. Guntur.

928
01:11:55.150 --> 01:11:59.983
That's not a problem.
Number one or two, it's just a number.

929
01:12:00.733 --> 01:12:03.102
Yes. What?

930
01:12:04.694 --> 01:12:06.944
-Ben, I'm going outside.
-Okay.

931
01:12:10.153 --> 01:12:12.739
Don't bother. Leave it to Mommy.

932
01:12:13.335 --> 01:12:15.501
-I mean Diana.
-It's okay.

933
01:12:18.996 --> 01:12:20.996
Where's the coffee special mix?

934
01:12:21.690 --> 01:12:22.856
It's here.

935
01:12:29.451 --> 01:12:32.826
It's a special coffee,
so I can smell it.

936
01:12:36.415 --> 01:12:37.499
Thank you.

937
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:49.709
-How's your work, Ben?
-Good, I should've celebration today.

938
01:12:50.203 --> 01:12:51.328
What celebration?

939
01:12:51.769 --> 01:12:55.769
I got a promotion. I was appointed
as the Head of Sales in Southeast Asia.

940
01:12:57.783 --> 01:13:00.574
-You're great.
-You too.

941
01:13:01.481 --> 01:13:04.052
I heard a lot about you
that your career is now...

942
01:13:04.094 --> 01:13:05.147
Ben.

943
01:13:08.544 --> 01:13:10.141
I'm sorry.

944
01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:14.472
I wasn't good partner.

945
01:13:16.429 --> 01:13:18.169
I wasn't supportive to you.

946
01:13:22.021 --> 01:13:25.779
If you're talking about our break up
in high school, no need to say sorry.

947
01:13:25.821 --> 01:13:27.155
You're not wrong anyway.

948
01:13:27.583 --> 01:13:29.749
It's the way our life supposed to be.

949
01:13:30.109 --> 01:13:32.568
Besides now
I'm happy seeing you with Tama.

950
01:13:33.669 --> 01:13:35.457
You're such a perfect couple.

951
01:13:39.464 --> 01:13:41.922
Diana and I are waiting
for your wedding invitation.

952
01:14:01.149 --> 01:14:03.128
-Now repeat after me.
-Okay.

953
01:14:03.170 --> 01:14:09.837
Hair, mouth, nose, eyes, ears, stomach.

954
01:14:11.555 --> 01:14:15.930
-I was wrong. Okay.
-Okay, now is my turn.

955
01:14:16.773 --> 01:14:17.773
Mouth!

956
01:14:20.846 --> 01:14:23.458
-I lost again. One more time.
-Okay.

957
01:14:23.498 --> 01:14:25.998
-Now it's my turn.
-Okay.

958
01:14:26.039 --> 01:14:27.123
Eyes!

959
01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:33.192
I lost again.

960
01:14:33.233 --> 01:14:37.608
Mommy, I love you so much.

961
01:14:37.649 --> 01:14:42.315
I love you too,
but now you must go to sleep.

962
01:14:42.356 --> 01:14:46.065
You'll be late tomorrow.
Okay, come on let's go to sleep.

963
01:14:51.178 --> 01:14:54.178
-Mommy, where's my princess?
-This is my princess.

964
01:15:05.152 --> 01:15:10.527
-Pleasant night, thank you.
-Safe ride, Tam, thank you.

965
01:15:10.586 --> 01:15:12.169
-Bye.
-Bye.

966
01:15:12.210 --> 01:15:13.377
Come on, Sweety.

967
01:15:23.117 --> 01:15:25.408
Kirana, are you okay?

968
01:15:29.557 --> 01:15:34.677
All right, if this is about the surprise
the other day, I'm sorry.

969
01:15:35.212 --> 01:15:37.202
I don't care about that.

970
01:15:39.219 --> 01:15:40.760
Then, what's wrong with you?

971
01:15:43.797 --> 01:15:45.630
This is not my life.

972
01:15:48.532 --> 01:15:50.907
I should be the one in that house.

973
01:15:53.888 --> 01:15:56.513
-What do you mean?
-I...

974
01:15:58.788 --> 01:16:02.038
It's okay, just take me home, Tama.

975
01:17:11.542 --> 01:17:12.542
Miss.

976
01:17:17.812 --> 01:17:23.104
You're such a good assistant, Ndra.
I called you, you showed up.

977
01:17:25.126 --> 01:17:29.126
What's the matter, Miss?
How come you're like this?

978
01:17:36.408 --> 01:17:41.928
-Madam Sri Menyan?
-This is the life that I want.

979
01:17:44.868 --> 01:17:47.968
But it's not the life I need.

980
01:17:50.148 --> 01:17:55.548
I need my family. My old life, Ndra.

981
01:17:58.308 --> 01:18:03.892
Now I'm stuck in this life,
I can't go back.

982
01:18:11.988 --> 01:18:14.878
I know you don't believe my story.

983
01:18:16.335 --> 01:18:19.919
I don't know
where Madam Sri Menyan is.

984
01:18:19.948 --> 01:18:24.268
-I can't find her at all.
-I believe in you.

985
01:18:27.922 --> 01:18:31.047
You don't have pretend to believe me
to calm me down.

986
01:18:41.623 --> 01:18:45.498
-You too?
-That night my wish was...

987
01:18:46.622 --> 01:18:49.122
I want to remain
to be a boss right-hand man.

988
01:18:50.368 --> 01:18:51.968
But not with the same boss.

989
01:18:54.028 --> 01:18:57.112
I like Miss Kirana
since we were in Student Council.

990
01:18:58.557 --> 01:19:00.057
Miss Kirana was the best boss.

991
01:19:07.007 --> 01:19:09.715
This isn't real, Ndra.

992
01:19:11.598 --> 01:19:16.278
This is real, I'm real.
This apartment, your job.

993
01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:18.070
Mr. Tama's feelings to you,
this is all real.

994
01:19:18.108 --> 01:19:19.650
This is not real, Ndra.

995
01:19:20.194 --> 01:19:23.629
Should our destiny be determined
by this card?

996
01:19:24.983 --> 01:19:30.400
And to pay all of that,
I have to lost my family, Ndra.

997
01:19:33.128 --> 01:19:36.927
I don't know, maybe you
lost something too that I don't know.

998
01:19:36.968 --> 01:19:40.718
We have to find Madam Sri Menyan
until we found her.

999
01:19:40.759 --> 01:19:45.144
-We have to go back.
-Back to my failure life, Miss?

1000
01:19:46.908 --> 01:19:50.367
To my old boss? Miss Diana was cruel.

1001
01:19:50.409 --> 01:19:52.489
I am also cruel, Ndra.

1002
01:19:53.425 --> 01:19:56.092
You saw it, right? I have became cruel.

1003
01:19:57.248 --> 01:20:00.268
Now I can feel what Diana feels like.

1004
01:20:01.608 --> 01:20:04.539
When we can't get what we want...

1005
01:20:04.581 --> 01:20:08.039
and we are never satisfied
with what we get,...

1006
01:20:08.767 --> 01:20:11.892
we tend to hurt other people around us.

1007
01:20:21.690 --> 01:20:22.815
Thank you, Ndra.

1008
01:20:24.518 --> 01:20:26.102
Tomorrow, we go all over Jakarta.

1009
01:20:26.148 --> 01:20:28.773
We're going to look for Madam Sri Menyan
until we found her.

1010
01:20:30.048 --> 01:20:31.715
I will check the schedules, Miss.

1011
01:20:33.988 --> 01:20:35.260
What is that?

1012
01:20:38.285 --> 01:20:42.619
Invitation for high school reunion.
It's tomorrow. Are you not invited?

1013
01:20:43.168 --> 01:20:45.009
Miss Diana
is the chairman of the committee.

1014
01:20:45.051 --> 01:20:47.969
Oh, my God. Now I understand.

1015
01:20:49.088 --> 01:20:51.960
That means
the life that we live right now...

1016
01:20:52.002 --> 01:20:54.797
is the life before high school reunion.

1017
01:20:54.838 --> 01:20:58.129
Before we met Madam Sri Menyan
and our destiny was changed.

1018
01:20:58.828 --> 01:21:01.428
No wonder we can't found her.

1019
01:21:02.648 --> 01:21:05.048
That means
we return to the starting point.

1020
01:21:05.828 --> 01:21:09.127
The point where I first met
Madam Sri Menyan...

1021
01:21:09.169 --> 01:21:10.729
at the high school reunion.

1022
01:21:11.508 --> 01:21:13.276
Before the day change.

1023
01:21:13.318 --> 01:21:15.104
Back to the starting point.

1024
01:21:15.532 --> 01:21:17.365
Afterward, there's no return.

1025
01:21:18.548 --> 01:21:22.668
That means we have to make a wish
before past midnight.

1026
01:21:23.848 --> 01:21:28.488
If not, we will not able to return
to our old life.

1027
01:21:28.945 --> 01:21:32.903
We are stuck in this life.
We have to go there.

1028
01:21:46.528 --> 01:21:49.188
-Indra, I'm ready.
-Okay, Miss.

1029
01:21:49.948 --> 01:21:53.807
-Drink this, so you feel fresh.
-Thank you.

1030
01:21:57.162 --> 01:21:58.870
Fresh. Come, let's go.

1031
01:22:01.747 --> 01:22:03.789
-My head is spinning.
-What's wrong, Miss?

1032
01:22:05.909 --> 01:22:09.076
Miss Kirana, are you okay?

1033
01:22:10.308 --> 01:22:16.388
Miss.

1034
01:22:23.550 --> 01:22:27.800
Sorry, Miss, I don't want to go back.

1035
01:22:29.788 --> 01:22:31.622
I want to be like this forever.

1036
01:22:50.068 --> 01:22:54.347
-Ndra, are you alone?
-Yes, Miss.

1037
01:22:54.388 --> 01:22:57.208
-Kirana didn't come?
-No.

1038
01:23:02.159 --> 01:23:05.451
Miss, you didn't invite Miss Kirana?

1039
01:23:05.848 --> 01:23:09.932
What for? Kirana never like it,
she never comes to the reunion, right?

1040
01:23:11.628 --> 01:23:12.908
Excuse me, Ndra.

1041
01:23:19.135 --> 01:23:21.260
Hello.

1042
01:23:22.668 --> 01:23:25.918
-Go get married.
-How are you?

1043
01:23:36.134 --> 01:23:40.550
Miss, Miss Kirana.

1044
01:23:41.948 --> 01:23:43.815
-Inge.
-Miss.

1045
01:23:43.857 --> 01:23:47.169
Indra told me to take you
to the reunion party.

1046
01:23:48.028 --> 01:23:51.609
-Indra?
-He regrets it, he says sorry.

1047
01:23:51.651 --> 01:23:53.589
He feels guilty to Miss Kirana.

1048
01:23:53.988 --> 01:23:55.738
Come, Miss, there's still time.

1049
01:24:01.265 --> 01:24:04.015
Mrs. Fortune Teller,
please don't close yet.

1050
01:24:04.048 --> 01:24:05.207
Your mouth should be closed.

1051
01:24:05.248 --> 01:24:09.725
-Mrs, head of stone. It's Madam.
-I'm sorry, Madam.

1052
01:24:09.767 --> 01:24:10.994
Don't close it yet, please.

1053
01:24:11.610 --> 01:24:14.360
The reunion has ended,
why should I stay?

1054
01:24:14.408 --> 01:24:17.259
There's one person
who wants to meet you, it's important.

1055
01:24:17.301 --> 01:24:18.549
-She's on the way here.
-Indra!

1056
01:24:18.591 --> 01:24:20.341
That's her.

1057
01:24:25.083 --> 01:24:26.625
Miss, I'm sorry.

1058
01:24:27.048 --> 01:24:30.147
It's okay, Ndra.
The most important thing I'm here now.

1059
01:24:31.681 --> 01:24:34.808
Do you want to go back
to your regretful life?

1060
01:24:34.850 --> 01:24:38.100
No, I promise
I will never regret it again.

1061
01:24:38.530 --> 01:24:41.450
I love my family and I want to go back.

1062
01:24:43.190 --> 01:24:44.065
Go inside.

1063
01:24:51.150 --> 01:24:52.810
Pick a card.

1064
01:24:58.390 --> 01:25:00.810
What is your biggest regret in life?

1065
01:25:03.607 --> 01:25:05.049
I regret...

1066
01:25:05.743 --> 01:25:10.702
that I have never been grateful
for my past life.

1067
01:25:12.490 --> 01:25:14.170
Pick a second card, come on.

1068
01:25:20.270 --> 01:25:22.510
What is your deepest desires?

1069
01:25:25.970 --> 01:25:30.449
If I am still with my family
right now,...

1070
01:25:30.491 --> 01:25:33.671
I will never waste them.

1071
01:25:36.130 --> 01:25:38.290
I love them.

1072
01:25:39.010 --> 01:25:40.576
Open the third card.

1073
01:25:44.766 --> 01:25:45.849
Why is it blank?

1074
01:25:47.790 --> 01:25:50.694
There's someone who wants your life.

1075
01:25:50.736 --> 01:25:54.491
You could go back if she wants it too.

1076
01:25:58.770 --> 01:26:03.590
The person who wants your life,
you and her swap places.

1077
01:26:07.930 --> 01:26:09.050
Diana?

1078
01:26:12.450 --> 01:26:14.450
Indra, come on.

1079
01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:23.335
Thank you for accompanying me
to the reunion tonight, Dear.

1080
01:26:23.390 --> 01:26:24.850
You're welcome, Sweety.

1081
01:26:25.353 --> 01:26:28.145
-I love you, Dear.
-I love you too, Sweety.

1082
01:26:33.916 --> 01:26:35.275
Sorry, Mr. Ben.

1083
01:26:35.317 --> 01:26:39.749
If you have the time, my friends
need some advice on buying a car.

1084
01:26:40.630 --> 01:26:41.796
Wait a minute, Sweety.

1085
01:26:42.536 --> 01:26:43.620
Who?

1086
01:26:43.662 --> 01:26:45.786
Some friend of mine,
sorry to bother you, Mr. Ben.

1087
01:26:45.810 --> 01:26:46.923
Wait a minute, okay?

1088
01:26:47.649 --> 01:26:50.690
-Where? Okay.
-Over here.

1089
01:27:11.990 --> 01:27:13.008
Kirana.

1090
01:27:14.111 --> 01:27:17.820
Tama? I'm sorry, I'm in a rush.

1091
01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:21.497
Kirana, I have been looking
everywhere for you.

1092
01:27:22.913 --> 01:27:24.538
Sorry, there's something important.

1093
01:27:24.930 --> 01:27:27.970
Kirana, this one also important.

1094
01:27:34.012 --> 01:27:36.708
Will you marry me?

1095
01:27:37.139 --> 01:27:38.129
Tama.

1096
01:27:40.355 --> 01:27:42.272
Tama, get up.

1097
01:27:44.650 --> 01:27:47.692
-We can be together, Tama.
-Why?

1098
01:27:48.068 --> 01:27:50.208
I'm sure there's a woman
who are more appropriate for you.

1099
01:27:50.250 --> 01:27:51.526
I'm sorry.

1100
01:27:58.090 --> 01:28:01.086
That was a rehearsal. A rehearsal.

1101
01:28:01.128 --> 01:28:03.756
Wait for the actual date, okay.
Rehearsal.

1102
01:28:07.710 --> 01:28:08.737
Kirana?

1103
01:28:09.532 --> 01:28:12.282
Diana, I want my life back.

1104
01:28:13.030 --> 01:28:14.735
No, no way.

1105
01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:18.649
The reunion was over.
Madam Sri Menyan already gone.

1106
01:28:18.670 --> 01:28:21.268
No, Madam Sri Menyan
is waiting for us at the back.

1107
01:28:21.310 --> 01:28:22.685
I don't want to go back.

1108
01:28:22.726 --> 01:28:24.442
You want to take my life?

1109
01:28:24.484 --> 01:28:26.325
You're the one who wants mine
in the first place!

1110
01:28:26.390 --> 01:28:29.412
That's true
but I don't want to lose my family.

1111
01:28:29.454 --> 01:28:31.091
Well, me too!

1112
01:28:32.828 --> 01:28:33.744
Diana!

1113
01:28:38.606 --> 01:28:40.994
-Stop it, Diana. Are you crazy?
-No.

1114
01:28:41.036 --> 01:28:43.729
I don't want to go back
to my past life. No.

1115
01:28:43.771 --> 01:28:47.521
They're my family.
Rega and Windy are my blood.

1116
01:28:47.550 --> 01:28:51.028
They love me too.
I'm a better mother than you!

1117
01:28:51.070 --> 01:28:54.654
I raise them up,
I take care of them until now!

1118
01:28:55.068 --> 01:28:56.984
You don't have that memories, Diana.

1119
01:28:57.010 --> 01:29:00.349
Because it never happened
to your life before!

1120
01:29:00.390 --> 01:29:01.869
It's the same with me.

1121
01:29:01.910 --> 01:29:05.618
I don't know how the process
of building a PR consultant company.

1122
01:29:05.659 --> 01:29:08.399
Because it really never happened to me!

1123
01:29:09.862 --> 01:29:13.195
How can we be proud
of what we accomplished...

1124
01:29:13.236 --> 01:29:16.016
if we have never experienced
the process?

1125
01:29:18.359 --> 01:29:20.484
Stop it, Diana, we could die!

1126
01:29:20.512 --> 01:29:23.591
I'd rather die
than going back to my old life!

1127
01:29:30.690 --> 01:29:32.607
You're not a good mother, Diana.

1128
01:29:33.882 --> 01:29:35.798
You didn't love Rega and Windy.

1129
01:29:36.250 --> 01:29:39.869
You would rather both of us both died
than going back to your old life!

1130
01:29:40.287 --> 01:29:44.662
You don't think how would they feel
if they lost their mother?

1131
01:29:46.067 --> 01:29:50.025
I understand now,
you didn't do this for them.

1132
01:29:50.070 --> 01:29:53.290
-You're still in love with Ben.
-Because you took Ben from me!

1133
01:29:53.910 --> 01:29:55.549
I never did that.

1134
01:29:56.620 --> 01:30:00.036
-Ben was never in love with you!
-That's why I regret it!

1135
01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:06.790
Yes, Mrs. Diah?

1136
01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:10.162
What, Windy?

1137
01:30:11.116 --> 01:30:14.908
-Okay, I'm going home now.
-What wrong with Windy?

1138
01:30:14.950 --> 01:30:19.158
-Windy is suffocating.
-Go inside, hurry!

1139
01:30:25.460 --> 01:30:30.710
Miss Windy. Oh, my God, Miss.

1140
01:30:44.703 --> 01:30:46.536
-Windy.
-Windy.

1141
01:30:47.350 --> 01:30:49.226
-Windy, what's wrong, Dear?
-Honey!

1142
01:30:49.268 --> 01:30:52.071
-What happened to her?
-I don't know, Ma'am.

1143
01:30:54.835 --> 01:30:55.793
Windy.

1144
01:30:56.061 --> 01:30:57.811
(Biscuit)

1145
01:30:57.852 --> 01:31:01.731
She had a peanut biscuit.
She is allergic to peanut.

1146
01:31:01.770 --> 01:31:03.949
Mrs. Diah, why did you gave it to her?

1147
01:31:03.990 --> 01:31:07.549
-It wasn't me, Ma'am.
-Stop it. Please go to the refrigerator.

1148
01:31:07.590 --> 01:31:11.465
Please take a medicine in the blue bag
under the eggs in the chiller.

1149
01:31:12.103 --> 01:31:13.978
Get it, hurry.

1150
01:31:14.990 --> 01:31:19.454
Be patient, Dear. Don't give her pillow.

1151
01:31:19.496 --> 01:31:21.711
Keep her like this,
laying down without pillow.

1152
01:31:24.646 --> 01:31:27.528
Windy, you have to be strong, Honey.

1153
01:31:28.290 --> 01:31:31.749
-Windy.
-Kirana, Windy!

1154
01:31:31.790 --> 01:31:33.256
Windy, wake up.

1155
01:31:33.298 --> 01:31:36.423
-Kirana...
-Windy, wake up.

1156
01:31:37.310 --> 01:31:39.994
-Windy!
-Windy, please wake up.

1157
01:31:40.036 --> 01:31:43.204
One, two, three.

1158
01:31:43.978 --> 01:31:48.353
One, two, three.

1159
01:31:49.979 --> 01:31:52.396
Windy.

1160
01:31:52.437 --> 01:31:56.478
-Windy, my baby.
-Mommy.

1161
01:31:57.650 --> 01:32:04.530
-Mommy!
-Honey, this is Mommy.

1162
01:32:11.629 --> 01:32:14.879
-What is that, Na?
-This is her allergic medication.

1163
01:32:20.409 --> 01:32:23.950
Hold it, Dear. It'll be brief.

1164
01:32:23.991 --> 01:32:25.408
Be patient, Honey.

1165
01:32:28.329 --> 01:32:31.552
Done, it's done, Honey.

1166
01:32:31.594 --> 01:32:35.719
It's safe,
your breathing will be fine later.

1167
01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:39.460
Just lay like this for a while
without pillow.

1168
01:32:45.992 --> 01:32:48.034
Mom, I'm sorry.

1169
01:32:48.449 --> 01:32:52.741
Actually I'm the one
who gave Windy those biscuits.

1170
01:32:55.861 --> 01:32:59.861
Rega, why did you gave it to her?
It has peanuts in it!

1171
01:33:01.010 --> 01:33:02.541
I can't read, Mom.

1172
01:33:02.583 --> 01:33:05.000
How come you can't read?
Do you want to hurt your sister?

1173
01:33:05.041 --> 01:33:09.041
Diana. I told you Rega is dyslexia.

1174
01:33:19.570 --> 01:33:20.719
Kirana.

1175
01:33:22.782 --> 01:33:26.782
Time time about Rega's reports, I lied.

1176
01:33:28.130 --> 01:33:29.547
His grades was dropping.

1177
01:33:38.270 --> 01:33:40.662
Please give Rega confidence.

1178
01:33:41.881 --> 01:33:45.131
Don't let his weakness
hold up his future.

1179
01:33:52.270 --> 01:33:54.006
Please take care the children, Di.

1180
01:33:56.219 --> 01:33:57.219
Kirana.

1181
01:34:00.130 --> 01:34:01.963
Let's meet Madam Sri Menyan.

1182
01:34:02.375 --> 01:34:03.565
You are right.

1183
01:34:06.361 --> 01:34:08.527
I can never live as you.

1184
01:34:13.147 --> 01:34:16.467
Too late, it past midnight.

1185
01:34:19.679 --> 01:34:21.887
Did you forget about Ben's habit?

1186
01:34:22.451 --> 01:34:24.951
All clocks in this house
are 30 minutes ahead.

1187
01:34:28.315 --> 01:34:32.115
Oh, my God, you're right. Let's go!

1188
01:34:41.395 --> 01:34:44.475
-Five minutes left. They won't make it.
-Wait a minute.

1189
01:34:45.035 --> 01:34:47.375
We're still friends after this, right?

1190
01:34:54.195 --> 01:34:57.111
Okay, stop.

1191
01:35:00.235 --> 01:35:03.634
There's still time, come on!

1192
01:35:03.675 --> 01:35:06.541
They'll come, please wait for them.

1193
01:35:06.583 --> 01:35:08.196
Here they are!

1194
01:35:14.535 --> 01:35:18.160
-Are you ready?
-Hold it, I'm sorry, Ndra.

1195
01:35:18.201 --> 01:35:21.961
-Okay, Miss. Come on.
-Please come in.

1196
01:35:29.975 --> 01:35:31.475
Pick a card.

1197
01:35:33.142 --> 01:35:35.059
Please give out your cards.

1198
01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:38.955
You guys are ready.

1199
01:35:45.035 --> 01:35:49.743
I'm afraid, Na.
I'm the boss everyone hates.

1200
01:35:52.515 --> 01:35:54.940
All the staff loves you, Di.

1201
01:35:55.702 --> 01:35:59.952
Especially Indra, he's a good assistant.

1202
01:36:08.766 --> 01:36:09.806
Na...

1203
01:37:08.222 --> 01:37:09.549
Morning, Sweety.

1204
01:37:11.109 --> 01:37:12.234
Sweety?

1205
01:37:14.671 --> 01:37:17.421
You said you want me to be romantic?

1206
01:37:19.288 --> 01:37:21.830
Just Kir, it's romantic.

1207
01:37:26.151 --> 01:37:29.985
-Smells.
-Really? Sorry.

1208
01:37:35.451 --> 01:37:36.719
I miss you.

1209
01:37:37.445 --> 01:37:39.111
Do you miss me or my fart?

1210
01:37:44.811 --> 01:37:46.431
This is not like you, Kir.

1211
01:37:52.431 --> 01:37:54.552
Windy, Rega.

1212
01:37:56.424 --> 01:37:59.590
I love you guys so much.

1213
01:37:59.631 --> 01:38:02.923
-I love you too, Mom.
-I love you too, Mom.

1214
01:38:05.726 --> 01:38:09.768
Good morning. Everybody already wake up.

1215
01:38:10.571 --> 01:38:15.774
Mrs. Diah, I'm sorry.
I was too hard on you.

1216
01:38:15.816 --> 01:38:18.107
It's okay. It was nothing.

1217
01:38:18.148 --> 01:38:20.040
Let's shower, you'll be late.

1218
01:38:20.082 --> 01:38:23.169
-Me first!
-No, me first!

1219
01:38:50.831 --> 01:38:52.748
-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday!

1220
01:39:00.945 --> 01:39:03.362
♪Happy birthday to you♪

1221
01:39:03.403 --> 01:39:06.622
-Happy birthday, Miss.
-Thank you, Nge.

1222
01:39:07.625 --> 01:39:10.742
By the way, Indra has a crush on you
for a long time.

1223
01:39:10.784 --> 01:39:12.242
But he's afraid to tell you.

1224
01:39:16.940 --> 01:39:19.606
-You like Indra too, right?
-Yes.

1225
01:39:23.611 --> 01:39:24.971
Can I have the cake?

1226
01:39:26.826 --> 01:39:28.295
Happy birthday.

1227
01:39:30.413 --> 01:39:33.454
You're not thanking me?
Is it because I didn't bring any gifts?

1228
01:39:34.051 --> 01:39:35.718
I just want one gift.

1229
01:39:36.991 --> 01:39:42.116
Take me to dinner one more time.
I'll promise I won't say no.

1230
01:39:55.751 --> 01:40:00.168
Tina Cempaka, will you marry me?

1231
01:40:04.311 --> 01:40:06.038
What did I say?
Wait for the actual date.

1232
01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:07.592
This is the day!

1233
01:40:09.171 --> 01:40:12.650
That means
Diana and Bram are next, right?

1234
01:40:13.006 --> 01:40:16.014
No. I give the opportunity
to the younger ones first.

1235
01:40:16.056 --> 01:40:19.181
-Indra and Inge first, right?
-Just say amen.

1236
01:40:19.813 --> 01:40:21.406
I agree!

1237
01:40:22.777 --> 01:40:25.694
Lets's continue later, okay?

1238
01:40:25.735 --> 01:40:27.902
-Bye!
-Bye!

1239
01:40:27.943 --> 01:40:32.343
-Mom, come and join us!
-Okay!

1240
01:40:33.031 --> 01:40:34.887
-Let's take a picture.
-Okay!

1241
01:40:34.929 --> 01:40:38.706
-Come on, let's take a picture, Ben.
-Come here, one,...

1242
01:40:38.748 --> 01:40:40.790
two, three!

1243
01:40:59.859 --> 01:41:01.067
Action.

1244
01:41:03.888 --> 01:41:05.430
It's not working, stupid.

1245
01:41:06.176 --> 01:41:07.467
Bro, it's not working!

1246
01:41:08.841 --> 01:41:10.924
Just take me home, Tama.

1247
01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:22.437
Pick it up.

1248
01:41:23.429 --> 01:41:25.971
-Don't ever buttons... Buttons?
-"Buttons"?

1249
01:41:26.376 --> 01:41:27.501
"Don't ever buttons."

1250
01:41:29.018 --> 01:41:30.685
Don't touch me!

1251
01:41:31.556 --> 01:41:32.972
I'll burn down this house!

1252
01:41:38.072 --> 01:41:41.197
By the way, are you...

1253
01:41:43.726 --> 01:41:46.934
You once said that establish an image
means creating an illusion.

1254
01:41:46.975 --> 01:41:49.850
-It's not in accordance with reality.
-So?

1255
01:41:50.537 --> 01:41:52.495
So, why is Ti...

1256
01:41:57.696 --> 01:41:59.362
Sorry.

1257
01:42:01.089 --> 01:42:02.255
I'm in a hurry.

1258
01:42:07.284 --> 01:42:10.075
-Who are we?
-Screaming Queens!

1259
01:42:10.116 --> 01:42:12.783
-Say what?
-Screaming Queens!

1260
01:42:12.824 --> 01:42:14.532
This is bad.

1261
01:42:17.441 --> 01:42:18.941
I forgot this one, sorry.

1262
01:42:19.282 --> 01:42:22.907
You! What character is this?
Donald Duck?

1263
01:42:22.948 --> 01:42:24.323
Don't touch me.

1264
01:42:24.364 --> 01:42:26.155
What are you doing?

1265
01:42:29.159 --> 01:42:31.826
Will you marry me?

1266
01:42:34.034 --> 01:42:35.492
Yes!

1267
01:42:37.583 --> 01:42:39.583
I'm sorry, where should I go?

1268
01:42:43.698 --> 01:42:44.781
Action.

1269
01:42:45.913 --> 01:42:47.372
The lens is closed.

1270
01:42:49.950 --> 01:42:51.908
What an interesting...

1271
01:42:55.695 --> 01:42:57.028
I'm so nervous, Ndra.

1272
01:42:58.169 --> 01:42:59.460
Did I laugh?

1273
01:43:00.144 --> 01:43:02.060
I should be me who are nervous!

1274
01:43:02.653 --> 01:43:04.111
Go on!

1275
01:43:06.974 --> 01:43:08.558
I forgot my lines.

1276
01:43:11.687 --> 01:43:13.312
It should be me...

1277
01:43:15.507 --> 01:43:17.049
What's my line?

1278
01:43:23.794 --> 01:43:25.627
What am I rambling about? Oh, my God.

1279
01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:28.403
I'm going to go to the toilet, Tama.

1280
01:43:30.202 --> 01:43:32.661
Kirana, but give me your name card.

1281
01:43:33.437 --> 01:43:34.604
Kirana.

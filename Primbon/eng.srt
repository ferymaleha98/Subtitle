3
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,958
Janu is not ready yet.

4
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:36,708
So, we're going to wait.

5
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:39,875
- Rana?
- Janu!

6
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:41,583
What are you doing?

7
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:44,791
Let's go! Come with me to the woods.

8
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:47,541
What are you gonna do in the woods?

9
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:50,333
I want to make a gift for Mom's birthday.

10
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:54,000
I told Dad I was going with you.

11
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:56,166
What? But you didn't tell me.

12
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,791
Let's just go.

13
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:00,583
But are you sure told your dad?

14
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,833
I did. Now come on.

15
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:04,791
My goodness, Rana...

16
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:06,250
Okay, hang on a minute.

17
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,416
- Hurry up, okay?
- Okay, okay.

18
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:28,500
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

19
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:33,250
{\an8}<i>we are deeply saddened to inform you</i>

20
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:36,250
{\an8}<i>that our daughter, Rana,</i>

21
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:40,000
{\an8}<i>has been lost in the woods
since yesterday afternoon.</i>

22
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:46,083
{\an8}- Rana!
- Rana!

23
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:51,916
{\an8}<i>I would very much appreciate it
if we went together</i>

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,125
{\an8}<i>to search for our daughter, Rana,
in the woods.</i>

25
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:55,666
{\an8}Rana!

26
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:59,458
{\an8}- Rana!
- Rana!

27
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:00,791
{\an8}Sister!

28
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:05,083
{\an8}- Rana!
- Rana!

29
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,750
{\an8}Rana!

30
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:12,750
{\an8}- Rana!
- Rana!

31
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,291
{\an8}Sis!

32
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,583
{\an8}- Rana!
- Rana!

33
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:18,125
{\an8}Rana!

34
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:24,916
{\an8}I hope she'll be found alive and unharmed.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,875
{\an8}Amen.

36
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,000
{\an8}I thank you

37
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:33,041
{\an8}for all your sincere concern and help.

38
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:38,250
{\an8}I appreciate it very much.

39
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:08,000
{\an8}- Here you go, sir.
- Thank you.

40
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,291
{\an8}Yes.

41
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,750
{\an8}Thank you.

42
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,041
{\an8}- Hey.
- Yes?

43
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:17,041
{\an8}Why do a Tahlil ritual
if they haven't found the body?

44
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,541
{\an8}I'm not surprised.

45
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:25,208
{\an8}According to Miss Nur, after calculating
her birth date, it is time. Right?

46
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:29,166
{\an8}But she has only been gone for a week.
Is it okay to do a Tahlil ritual?

47
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,333
{\an8}Thank you.

48
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,916
{\an8}<i>Are you sure? Do you really have to go?</i>

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,083
{\an8}Stop asking me questions.

50
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,041
{\an8}You expect a mother not to ask questions
of her own daughter?

51
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:07,583
{\an8}- Mom, I have to do something very urgent.
- How urgent can it be?

52
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,208
{\an8}- Very urgent.
- Can you do it another day?

53
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,541
{\an8}What about my birthday?

54
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:16,333
{\an8}Mom, before you blow the candles,
I promise I'll be back home, okay?

55
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:17,916
{\an8}- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,375
{\an8}- You'll bring some snacks?
- Yes.

57
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,916
{\an8}- Water?
- I will. Okay?

58
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,125
{\an8}Bye.

59
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,916
{\an8}- That kiss is new.
- Let's do arm-wrestling then.

60
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,833
{\an8}No, that's a boy's game.

61
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,500
{\an8}- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, sweetheart.

62
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:37,250
{\an8}- Be careful out there.
- Okay, bye!

63
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,458
{\an8}You've cleaned everything?

64
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,208
{\an8}Everything?

65
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:55,583
Sis.

66
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,583
This is the Yasin from Mom's funeral.

67
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,041
All right, I'll tell Sis Nur.

68
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:05,541
- Sis Nur...
- It was made long ago.

69
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:08,375
<i>If I'm not mistaken, it was...</i>

70
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:12,166
Fitting into this big family
is not easy, Din.

71
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,291
As a Javanese man myself,
I find it hard too.

72
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,833
I can understand
since you're not even Javanese.

73
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,083
- Too much work.
<i>- I didn't tell them anything.</i>

74
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:23,208
- Just hang in there.
<i>- But I want something like Mom's Yasin.</i>

75
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:24,875
- Thank you.
<i>- Well?</i>

76
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,375
It's okay.

77
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,666
But we have to agree on something first.

78
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,750
What date do you want
to be put in the obituary?

79
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,458
I didn't think of that.

80
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,000
Well, what date?

81
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,833
Do you want the date of her disappearance

82
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,500
or the date they called off the search?

83
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,375
Not the date of her disappearance.

84
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,708
That's a cursed day.

85
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,333
"Monday <i>Pon.</i>

86
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:57,250
The day of the dead,

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,500
and a cursed day.

88
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:03,916
Meaning, a terrible fate will be
upon the person,

89
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,750
and the earth will swallow the person."

90
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:10,500
In other words,
they will be swallowed by the earth.

91
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:14,583
But it is the person's fate.

92
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,833
It will be their last day on Earth.

93
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,000
It means

94
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,041
death.

95
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,458
Then, we're not gonna use that date.

96
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:30,500
I don't want more bad luck
on her 40th-day memorial ceremony.

97
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:31,791
All right, then.

98
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,875
Let's agree on the date.

99
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:38,958
Let's agree it's the date
when they called off her search.

100
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:39,958
Is that okay?

101
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,875
Look at how easily you are
talking about death.

102
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:52,458
You seem to love controlling
someone's life and death.

103
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,916
But you know the truth.

104
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,625
Her body hasn't been discovered yet.

105
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,125
Din.

106
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:02,041
I want you to be strong.

107
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:07,041
There's nothing we can do
when it comes to someone's fate.

108
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:13,916
You want me to believe in fate?
Fate according to whom?

109
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,958
We just want the deceased
to rest in peace.

110
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,500
That's why we have to pick the date.

111
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,750
Her name is Rana.

112
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,458
Not "the deceased."

113
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,291
I am her mother.

114
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:35,333
I know what's best for my daughter.

115
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,833
And what are you doing now?

116
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:43,750
You invited people for a Tahlil ritual.
You decided the date of her death.

117
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,916
You gave up.
Do you think giving up is better?

118
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,333
How do you know which is better?

119
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,041
I warned you

120
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,666
that if you let Rana go that day,
misfortune would happen.

121
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,000
But you let her go.

122
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:01,666
You're still resisting our beliefs.

123
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:06,708
Even though you knew this wasn't
the first time.

124
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:10,375
Now, your foolishness
has claimed your daughter,

125
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:11,916
and you still refuse to believe?

126
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,208
I will believe

127
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,875
only if my daughter comes back alive.

128
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,500
Is that so wrong?

129
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,083
Rana?

130
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:42,958
Rana...

131
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:20,500
Rana!

132
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,375
Sri.

133
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,458
You have to tell Banyu.

134
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:20,875
Why me? Why don't you tell him?

135
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,416
You're closer to him.

136
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,041
How about we let Sis Nur tell him?

137
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,041
You're right. She knows how to calculate
properly according to the book.

138
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:32,000
- But we have to do it now, or...
- Sis!

139
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,375
What are you discussing?

140
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:36,791
How's Rana? What did she tell you?

141
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,875
Did she get hurt?

142
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:41,208
Your niece has returned.

143
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,250
Stop thinking about bad stuff.

144
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:47,666
Banyu, if she was still alive, why did she
only come home after seven days?

145
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,458
I don't know.

146
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:52,250
But she looks fine to me.

147
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,416
Use your brain.

148
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,750
Did you find anything peculiar?

149
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,458
Are her feet touching the ground?

150
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,500
Why don't you check on your daughter?

151
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,000
I can't believe you. How could you?

152
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,375
- Can you believe them?
- Calm down, Banyu.

153
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:16,625
I can't believe how badly age
is damaging your minds.

154
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:20,708
- Why are you mad at us?
- My calculation is accurate.

155
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,166
She's right. You should listen
to your older sister.

156
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,041
I need your support.

157
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:30,041
She was lost and now she has been found.
Stop complicating the situation.

158
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,208
What song is this?

159
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,291
You missed us, didn't you?

160
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,500
Everybody said

161
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,291
that you were gone.

162
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,250
"You have to be strong."

163
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,041
"You have to let her go."

164
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:16,333
But, Rana, I knew. I believed.

165
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,416
I knew you were still alive.

166
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,916
You promised, didn't you?

167
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,125
You promised to come home.

168
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,166
That you'd come home. Right?

169
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,333
Forgive me, Mom.

170
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,083
What for?

171
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,375
Never apologize.

172
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,458
You're home, sweetheart.

173
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,833
You're home.

174
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,958
Tari.

175
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,791
Has your sister taken a shower?

176
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:56,875
She just went into the bathroom.

177
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,833
Here, do me a favor.

178
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:04,458
Put the towel in the bathroom.
I forgot to put it there.

179
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:05,791
Okay.

180
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,083
Tari.

181
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,500
Your prayers have been answered.

182
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:14,250
I want you to help me and your father.
Let's keep your sister safe.

183
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,333
Okay?

184
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:47,458
Sis?

185
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,666
Sis...

186
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:24,375
You're done showering?

187
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,500
It's not funny, you know.

188
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:25,625
I thought I had
some noodles left yesterday.

189
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:29,750
I think it's been a while since
the last time we bought instant ramen.

190
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:30,958
Can you buy them for me?

191
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:35,916
Just in case Rana needs a midnight snack
and finds nothing in the drawer.

192
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,333
I think I'd better call a doctor, Din.

193
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:44,875
I don't think we need a doctor.

194
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:48,000
I've checked her. No cuts or bruises.

195
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,833
But Nur said we should be cautious.

196
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,458
Making sure is not a bad thing, right?

197
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:03,875
Just in case. If anything happened to her,
we'd be prepared.

198
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,791
Are you afraid of your own daughter?

199
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,458
That's not what I meant.

200
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:14,750
I said, if anything happened to her,
we'd be prepared.

201
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,875
Prepared for what?

202
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,708
I can't believe this.

203
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:24,333
How could a father not seem happy to see
his dead daughter come home alive?

204
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:25,500
How odd.

205
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,916
You should be happy.

206
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,041
Everybody saw her.
She's here in the flesh.

207
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:33,958
Your daughter...

208
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:38,750
she came home right after everybody
decided she was dead.

209
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,708
- Don't say that.
- Well?

210
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,875
I'm just saying.

211
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,916
It's better to be safe than sorry.

212
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,291
Honey, that's it.
I'm sick and tired of this nonsense.

213
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,750
I know your sisters
have poisoned your mind.

214
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:58,958
Their blind belief in the Primbon book
is driving them crazy.

215
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:09,916
I'm sorry.
But I just want to share my thoughts.

216
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:17,750
The more we know, the better, Din.

217
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,625
I know, but not...

218
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:21,958
- But...
- Enough.

219
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,458
Let's drop this topic, okay?

220
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:24,458
Don't cry.

221
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:27,250
No, I'm not crying. I just don't want
to talk about it anymore.

222
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,291
Enough.

223
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:39,958
After you went missing,
Mom and Dad wouldn't stop fighting.

224
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,791
I began to get used to it.

225
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,541
I know they both missed you.

226
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,416
Especially Mom.

227
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:55,083
She didn't stop crying
from the day you went missing.

228
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,708
She wouldn't cut her birthday cake
until she knew you'd come home safe.

229
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,166
What about your present?

230
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,375
Did you make it?

231
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:14,958
You're still tired?

232
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:40,291
We didn't know what to do
when you went missing.

233
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,916
But Mom insisted that
you were still alive.

234
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,791
There were moments
I doubted that you were.

235
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,500
I'm sorry for thinking about it.

236
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,333
But I'm happy you're home now.

237
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,666
I missed you, sis.

238
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,416
You just want to sing with Dad, huh?

239
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,875
You want to sing with me.

240
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,875
You're hungry, Na?

241
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:03,375
Mom said they just released a new flavor.

242
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:04,833
Your favorite brand.

243
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:11,000
Let me get it for you at the market, okay?

244
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,541
Are you feeling okay?

245
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,500
I've asked Dr. Adi to come to examine you.

246
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:17,416
It's only morning
and I'm already in debt again.

247
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,833
- You're in debt again?
- Yes.

248
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,333
- Morning, ma'am.
- Are you all ready?

249
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:26,750
Not yet, ma'am.

250
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:28,375
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Yes.

251
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:30,875
Excuse me, ma'am.

252
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:33,000
- Hello, hello.
- Yes.

253
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:18,208
<i>Dad!</i>

254
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,583
<i>Daddy!</i>

255
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:23,958
What is it, sweetheart?

256
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:25,041
Ow.

257
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:27,833
Please, can I?

258
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:32,458
Na, it's dangerous.
It's raining season now.

259
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:35,833
- You should avoid going to the woods.
- But Janu will be there with me.

260
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:41,208
Your aunt said you should stay home.

261
00:24:41,791 --> 00:24:44,166
It's your mother's birthday too.

262
00:24:45,541 --> 00:24:47,916
Dad, I'll go with Janu.

263
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,791
He can protect me.

264
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:54,791
Okay? If anything happens,
you should hold him responsible.

265
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:56,833
God forbid.

266
00:24:58,166 --> 00:24:59,750
Just do as I say this time.

267
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,500
Or how about this?

268
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:05,041
How about,

269
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:09,625
I'll go help you at the market for a week
if you allow me to go?

270
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,750
Please?

271
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:14,875
- Promise?
- I promise.

272
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:16,166
- Are you sure?
- Yeah!

273
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,041
- Again, promise?
- I promise.

274
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:19,958
- I can't believe it.
- Can I go now?

275
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:21,125
Fine.

276
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:23,916
Be careful with the cleaver, Banyu.

277
00:25:24,708 --> 00:25:28,333
You'll cut your thumb instead of the fish.

278
00:25:29,583 --> 00:25:31,208
That's impossible.

279
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:37,458
Rana's not coming with you?
She's already started taking classes?

280
00:25:40,166 --> 00:25:42,416
She's better staying at home still.

281
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,666
The timing is not right.

282
00:25:44,958 --> 00:25:46,833
How is she anyway?

283
00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:48,375
She's okay, right?

284
00:25:48,458 --> 00:25:51,375
No bruises or injuries?

285
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:55,625
Her body is fine.

286
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,416
But I can't say the same with her mind.

287
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,000
There you go.

288
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,750
You know what?

289
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:06,583
That's because your big family
is freaking out thinking she's a ghost.

290
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:08,291
No wonder it's affecting her mind.

291
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:10,708
- Sir.
- Yes?

292
00:26:10,791 --> 00:26:12,416
- Can I buy the squid?
- How many kilos?

293
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,666
- For the amount of 50,000.
- Okay.

294
00:26:29,416 --> 00:26:32,041
- Here you go. Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

295
00:26:32,125 --> 00:26:34,333
Relax, Banyu.

296
00:26:34,416 --> 00:26:36,375
Stop overthinking it.

297
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:40,166
You know how your sisters
are always exaggerating.

298
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:45,458
They're treating the Primbon book
as a life manual.

299
00:26:47,125 --> 00:26:50,208
When your mother was still with us,

300
00:26:50,291 --> 00:26:52,000
I was like you.

301
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:55,666
Catching fish had to wait until
they approved the date.

302
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:58,791
"Is it a good day or a bad day to
catch fish?" So complicated.

303
00:27:00,416 --> 00:27:02,041
I was exactly like you.

304
00:27:02,833 --> 00:27:06,375
They were so furious when I told them
I was going to marry Dini.

305
00:27:07,333 --> 00:27:10,416
Then my mother died.

306
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,958
Yes.

307
00:27:12,041 --> 00:27:15,083
But not everything is about their belief.

308
00:27:16,041 --> 00:27:20,833
Javanese people always follow
their hearts first.

309
00:27:21,666 --> 00:27:25,958
Blessed day or cursed day, who's to say?

310
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:27,041
Right?

311
00:27:28,791 --> 00:27:29,791
You're correct.

312
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:34,333
Take Rana here tomorrow.

313
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:36,083
What for?

314
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:38,833
Who knows?

315
00:27:38,916 --> 00:27:41,250
Maybe after eating this fish,
she'll turn into a human.

316
00:27:42,041 --> 00:27:43,250
What kind of human?

317
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,125
A human fish.

318
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,291
That would be very scary.

319
00:27:49,166 --> 00:27:50,208
I know.

320
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,416
Janu!

321
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,500
Janu!

322
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:23,750
Janu...

323
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:26,666
Do you know Rana has returned home?

324
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:29,208
Don't you want to see her?

325
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,875
It can't be.

326
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:33,416
No, it can't be.

327
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,500
Janu.

328
00:28:48,916 --> 00:28:50,791
- Here's 20 for the change, ma'am.
- Yes.

329
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:52,208
We're sold out, ma'am.

330
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:53,708
- Here you go.
- Thank you, ma'am.

331
00:28:53,791 --> 00:28:54,958
Bye.

332
00:28:55,041 --> 00:28:56,166
Ma'am.

333
00:28:57,916 --> 00:28:59,583
So this is why.

334
00:28:59,666 --> 00:29:02,791
I wondered why my ears were twitching.

335
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:07,166
Apparently, I was getting a visit
from an old customer.

336
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:12,666
- Your daughter has returned?
- Yes, ma'am.

337
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,333
That's why I came here.

338
00:29:14,416 --> 00:29:17,750
To cook her special meal,
I need some ingredients.

339
00:29:17,833 --> 00:29:19,625
Which rice tastes better?

340
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:22,541
- Is this the one?
- I mean...

341
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:24,416
She returned on the night
you held a Tahlil ritual?

342
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,291
I wonder why?

343
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:27,958
Are you sure it's her?

344
00:29:28,041 --> 00:29:29,958
Be careful of haunting spirits.

345
00:29:31,416 --> 00:29:32,416
I'm not joking, ladies!

346
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:38,166
They're spirits who stay near their houses
for the first 40 days after their death.

347
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:40,416
Mrs. Dini.

348
00:29:41,541 --> 00:29:43,875
What dream did you have
before your daughter returned?

349
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:48,000
No dream at all.
I don't trust dreams in this day and age.

350
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:51,208
But

351
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:55,583
dreams can sometimes also come true.

352
00:29:55,666 --> 00:30:01,916
My neighbor once put down a pan,
but it fell down and broke.

353
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:05,291
Not long after that, her neighbor died.

354
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:07,375
- Are you sure?
- I swear.

355
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:11,208
Hey. Did you check with Miss Nur first?

356
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:16,000
Was the premonition good or bad?

357
00:30:20,833 --> 00:30:21,791
See?

358
00:30:22,833 --> 00:30:25,958
According to Primbon,
when something falls,

359
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:28,125
that means a relative is going to die.

360
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:33,500
But you were talking about dreams.
But this is not a dream at all.

361
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:35,375
We all saw the pan fall.

362
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,875
Let me buy the pan, then. How much?

363
00:30:37,958 --> 00:30:40,375
- You want to buy me a new one?
- How much do you want for that?

364
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:42,458
Thank you, Din.

365
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,291
Let's say you didn't dream
about it at all.

366
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:47,458
But did you get any premonition at all?

367
00:30:47,541 --> 00:30:49,958
Are you sure she's really your daughter?

368
00:30:52,666 --> 00:30:54,250
Ma'am, I've changed my mind
about buying your rice.

369
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:55,333
What's going on?

370
00:30:56,125 --> 00:30:58,416
I can hear your yelling
from my stall over there.

371
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,541
If you want to meet Rana,
you can come with me.

372
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:03,625
You can see her for yourself.
There's nothing wrong with her at all.

373
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:06,041
Right?

374
00:31:08,708 --> 00:31:10,208
Honey, please help.

375
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:13,500
- Have you paid for your groceries?
- You can pay for the pan.

376
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:16,083
Regarding the pan,
she said she was buying my pan.

377
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:17,875
Yes, but not the rice. Just the pan.

378
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:20,208
Honey, just pay for the pan.

379
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:22,041
- How much?
- It's up to you.

380
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,458
You can't do that!

381
00:31:25,375 --> 00:31:26,583
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

382
00:31:26,666 --> 00:31:27,375
Sure.

383
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:28,791
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Sure.

384
00:31:29,583 --> 00:31:32,416
- You're ready to go home?
- Yes.

385
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,916
Can you buy some food on the way home?

386
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,125
When I left the house,
Rana was still sleeping.

387
00:31:37,208 --> 00:31:39,375
I don't want her to wake up hungry.

388
00:31:39,458 --> 00:31:41,000
I didn't want to wake her up.

389
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:42,958
She's alone at home?

390
00:31:43,041 --> 00:31:45,125
I needed to buy some groceries.

391
00:31:45,208 --> 00:31:47,041
- Okay then, I'm leaving right now.
- Okay.

392
00:31:47,125 --> 00:31:48,875
- Don't forget the lunch.
- Are you okay being here alone?

393
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:40,333
Sis.

394
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:43,208
I want to put this in Rana's room.

395
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:44,458
Is this much enough?

396
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:46,583
It's for protection.

397
00:32:47,625 --> 00:32:49,791
If the flowers wilt immediately,

398
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:53,666
then she's not human.

399
00:34:56,625 --> 00:34:57,500
Aunt Ning.

400
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:08,375
I remember you used to love
braiding my hair, right?

401
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:40,333
Aunt Nur told you many
Primbon book stories, right?

402
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:45,083
Can you tell the stories again to me?

403
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:54,000
The Primbon Mangkuprajan book says this.

404
00:35:56,291 --> 00:35:58,833
You were born on Saturday.

405
00:36:02,666 --> 00:36:06,000
It is very influenced by earth.

406
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:11,291
That is why you are a special girl.

407
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,916
You are loved by many...

408
00:36:21,625 --> 00:36:22,916
What's wrong, Aunt Ning?

409
00:36:27,541 --> 00:36:28,541
Aunt Ning?

410
00:36:41,041 --> 00:36:42,625
- What's wrong, sis?
- Sri...

411
00:36:42,708 --> 00:36:43,708
What happened?

412
00:36:43,791 --> 00:36:45,666
What are you doing in Rana's room?

413
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:49,958
I was braiding Rana's hair, Sri.

414
00:36:51,583 --> 00:36:54,916
But her scalp is rotting.

415
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,583
- There were maggots everywhere, Sri.
- Oh my...

416
00:36:58,666 --> 00:37:00,291
I freaked out!

417
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,916
I couldn't stand the smell.

418
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:09,666
You're freaking me out.

419
00:37:12,208 --> 00:37:13,208
Sri...

420
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,875
Don't you realize?

421
00:37:15,958 --> 00:37:17,500
From the day she went missing,

422
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:21,708
that plaintive cuckoo hasn't stopped
singing in front of Banyu's house.

423
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
You know what sign that is?

424
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,458
That's the sign of <i>kepaten,</i> Sri.

425
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:32,541
There's death in the house.

426
00:37:34,708 --> 00:37:35,708
You're right.

427
00:37:36,541 --> 00:37:38,791
But if Rana were really dead,

428
00:37:38,875 --> 00:37:41,708
how come we can still see her
in the flesh?

429
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:46,000
I don't know, Sri.

430
00:37:47,958 --> 00:37:49,333
We should listen to what Sis Nur says.

431
00:37:49,416 --> 00:37:50,833
I don't want to make the wrong decision.

432
00:37:50,916 --> 00:37:53,125
Oh my... you're right.

433
00:37:53,208 --> 00:37:54,791
Oh, no.

434
00:37:54,875 --> 00:37:55,875
Sri.

435
00:37:58,625 --> 00:38:00,041
What's going on in here?

436
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:03,333
Do you think I'm a ghost too?

437
00:38:03,416 --> 00:38:06,041
That's not funny.

438
00:38:06,125 --> 00:38:09,083
- What's wrong?
- You're startling us.

439
00:38:09,708 --> 00:38:10,750
- Oh...
- What is it?

440
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:14,041
I just want to ask your opinion.

441
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,791
Let me ask you something.

442
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:20,458
Aren't you curious about whether that girl
is really Rana or not?

443
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:24,708
I think we still have to prove
that it's really her.

444
00:38:24,791 --> 00:38:29,291
We did that when Sis Ning put down
a tray of offering flowers.

445
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:30,375
Right, sis?

446
00:38:31,125 --> 00:38:32,208
What?

447
00:38:32,291 --> 00:38:34,875
Do you have the courage
to retrieve the tray?

448
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:02,208
Pray to God, Ning.

449
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:07,750
Ask Him to protect you from Rana.

450
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,750
Hey, sis? What are you doing here?

451
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:52,958
Aunt Sri.

452
00:45:55,541 --> 00:45:57,458
You're looking for this, right?

453
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,958
Sis. What is it?

454
00:46:02,833 --> 00:46:04,583
Just return it to Aunt Ning.

455
00:46:12,958 --> 00:46:14,666
Sis!

456
00:46:15,625 --> 00:46:17,125
Your Aunt is going crazy.

457
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:20,083
Just eat your meal.
The doctor is on the way here.

458
00:46:20,583 --> 00:46:21,625
Okay?

459
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:47,708
That's Dad's favorite rice.

460
00:46:48,958 --> 00:46:51,250
The stir-fried tempeh is good.

461
00:46:52,666 --> 00:46:55,083
The boiled egg is good.

462
00:46:55,875 --> 00:46:57,708
The fried vermicelli is also good.

463
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,291
Don't you like the food?

464
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:03,333
I love it.

465
00:47:05,291 --> 00:47:06,583
Then start to eat.

466
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:14,333
Today, at the market,

467
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:19,125
Mom almost made a scene
in Mrs. Anik's stall.

468
00:47:22,916 --> 00:47:24,666
But it was with another buyer.

469
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,458
So, your Mom said

470
00:47:28,541 --> 00:47:33,875
Mrs. Anik's goods were filthy,
dirty, and smelled rotten.

471
00:47:33,958 --> 00:47:34,833
Basically, she called them bad.

472
00:47:34,916 --> 00:47:37,291
But the real reason she did that
was to get a low price.

473
00:47:41,041 --> 00:47:43,166
Your mother is smart, just like you.

474
00:47:45,875 --> 00:47:48,166
Eat the egg, it's good.

475
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:58,000
What's that?

476
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:00,375
Oh my...

477
00:48:00,458 --> 00:48:02,250
Are you okay, baby?

478
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:10,500
I told you not to go anywhere just yet.

479
00:48:11,791 --> 00:48:14,083
You have to eat healthy food
and have a lot of sleep,

480
00:48:14,166 --> 00:48:16,666
considering what just happened to you.

481
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:19,750
A pretty girl isn't supposed to have
a nosebleed. Wipe your nose.

482
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:26,833
Excuse me.

483
00:48:29,041 --> 00:48:30,833
Dr. Adi.

484
00:48:30,916 --> 00:48:32,583
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Doc.

485
00:48:32,666 --> 00:48:34,166
- Please, come in.
- Thank you.

486
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:35,416
- She's in there.
- May I?

487
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,583
Sure, go ahead.

488
00:48:40,291 --> 00:48:42,750
Na, this is Dr. Adi.

489
00:48:42,833 --> 00:48:44,500
- Is this the patient?
- Yes.

490
00:48:44,583 --> 00:48:45,583
It's okay.

491
00:48:46,291 --> 00:48:47,958
Let's do a little health check.

492
00:48:48,041 --> 00:48:49,416
You'll be okay.

493
00:48:50,666 --> 00:48:51,875
Excuse me, ma'am.

494
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:30,000
Can you open your mouth?

495
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:34,833
Look up at the roof, please.

496
00:49:44,291 --> 00:49:45,625
There's nothing wrong
with her, right, Doc?

497
00:49:45,708 --> 00:49:48,416
She's fine.

498
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:51,208
Can I use the bathroom?

499
00:49:51,291 --> 00:49:53,708
Yeah, sure. It's in the back.
Down the hall.

500
00:49:57,791 --> 00:50:00,083
Sis, I don't want to come in.

501
00:50:01,125 --> 00:50:02,041
Banyu!

502
00:50:04,291 --> 00:50:05,833
We need to talk.

503
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:14,208
Now what? If you don't believe it,
just come inside.

504
00:51:02,041 --> 00:51:04,125
Let's hear what the doctor says, okay?

505
00:51:05,125 --> 00:51:06,375
Doc?

506
00:51:07,291 --> 00:51:09,416
- She's okay, right?
- She's okay.

507
00:51:14,875 --> 00:51:16,208
Doctor... Doc!

508
00:51:16,291 --> 00:51:17,291
Why are you all outside?

509
00:51:17,875 --> 00:51:19,416
May I know what you're discussing?

510
00:51:21,041 --> 00:51:23,000
It's not just about Rana.

511
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:31,750
Rana has become a magnet for bad spirits,
attracting them to this property.

512
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:34,750
That's impossible.

513
00:51:34,833 --> 00:51:36,541
Impossible for you.

514
00:51:36,625 --> 00:51:38,708
Because you refuse to believe.

515
00:51:38,791 --> 00:51:41,666
Sri and I were tormented
by evil spirits last night.

516
00:51:42,916 --> 00:51:44,791
This bowl full of wilted flowers
is the proof.

517
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:48,250
When Sri went away with the tray,
the flowers were still fresh.

518
00:51:48,833 --> 00:51:50,958
What did you put in my house?

519
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:53,416
What did you put in there?

520
00:51:54,291 --> 00:51:55,416
Nyu.

521
00:51:56,375 --> 00:51:58,458
You're going to be sorry.

522
00:52:04,541 --> 00:52:06,333
What is she talking about?

523
00:52:09,916 --> 00:52:11,125
How is she doing?

524
00:52:12,333 --> 00:52:14,875
The doctor said she was fine.

525
00:52:18,833 --> 00:52:20,375
Sis. Sis.

526
00:52:20,458 --> 00:52:22,791
What are things going to come to
if we let this happen?

527
00:52:22,875 --> 00:52:26,500
Strange things keep on happening
around us.

528
00:52:26,583 --> 00:52:29,375
I don't want what happened to Mother
to happen again.

529
00:52:29,458 --> 00:52:31,041
Knock on wood.

530
00:52:32,625 --> 00:52:34,125
Sis.

531
00:52:34,208 --> 00:52:36,541
All the signs are clear, right?

532
00:52:36,625 --> 00:52:38,125
Hang on.

533
00:52:38,208 --> 00:52:39,833
What did the doctor say?

534
00:52:43,083 --> 00:52:45,333
If the doctor didn't say anything,

535
00:52:45,416 --> 00:52:48,541
why should we believe in signs
and the Primbon book and not science?

536
00:52:48,625 --> 00:52:49,625
I'm confused.

537
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:50,708
Bas!

538
00:52:50,791 --> 00:52:51,791
What?

539
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,500
Did I say something wrong?

540
00:52:57,208 --> 00:52:59,666
Have you forgotten what happened to Bagas?

541
00:53:00,833 --> 00:53:04,416
Bagas died because you chose science!

542
00:53:05,208 --> 00:53:08,083
- Sis, you've crossed the line!
- Calm down.

543
00:53:08,166 --> 00:53:10,166
Take it back!

544
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:13,541
- How dare you!
- Calm down, Sri.

545
00:53:16,583 --> 00:53:21,541
How could Ning say that to me?

546
00:53:22,958 --> 00:53:24,708
How could she be that cold?

547
00:53:27,166 --> 00:53:31,458
It made me so furious
when she talked like that about Bagas.

548
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,833
I know. Calm down, Sri.

549
00:53:33,916 --> 00:53:35,208
Collect yourself.

550
00:53:36,125 --> 00:53:37,666
We've talked about this before.

551
00:53:38,916 --> 00:53:43,583
Whatever happened to us,
we did the best we could, Sri.

552
00:53:43,666 --> 00:53:44,625
Right?

553
00:53:45,291 --> 00:53:46,666
Calm down.

554
00:53:48,916 --> 00:53:50,208
I know how you feel, Sri.

555
00:53:50,916 --> 00:53:54,333
When Rana returned home,
I thought about Bagas.

556
00:54:02,375 --> 00:54:05,083
Calm down, Sri. Calm down.

557
00:54:16,083 --> 00:54:17,083
Can I go with you, Dad?

558
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:20,500
Okay.

559
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,166
What do you want, ma'am? Prawns as usual?

560
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:44,250
Yes.

561
00:54:52,833 --> 00:54:54,083
What else, ma'am?

562
00:55:00,458 --> 00:55:01,458
Hey.

563
00:55:01,541 --> 00:55:03,625
Do you think that's a ghost?

564
00:55:03,708 --> 00:55:06,083
- Why is she...?
- That's Rana.

565
00:55:06,166 --> 00:55:07,375
Is that Rana?

566
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,375
But the girl beside him...

567
00:55:10,458 --> 00:55:11,541
Isn't that Rana?

568
00:55:12,541 --> 00:55:14,458
I'm not imagining this, right?

569
00:55:14,541 --> 00:55:18,291
- That's really her, right?
- My skin's crawling.

570
00:55:21,416 --> 00:55:23,083
She's here.

571
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:51,916
So, your aunts,
especially Aunt Nur, always say

572
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,833
that if we want to celebrate something

573
00:55:53,916 --> 00:55:56,625
or if someone has just recovered
from illness,

574
00:55:56,708 --> 00:55:58,583
we have to make ketupat.

575
00:55:58,666 --> 00:56:00,666
I'm following their belief.

576
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:03,541
I'm doing everything they taught me
and told me to do.

577
00:56:03,625 --> 00:56:08,291
They should've been happy to see you home,
all healthy and safe.

578
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:13,583
You should deliver them to your aunts.

579
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:17,875
Can you make ketupat?
Here, let me show you.

580
00:56:19,583 --> 00:56:21,333
It's easy.

581
00:56:21,416 --> 00:56:26,541
- Teach me how, Mom.
- Wrap it around your hand three times.

582
00:56:28,833 --> 00:56:30,125
Three times.

583
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:36,000
You got a short leaf!

584
00:56:39,583 --> 00:56:40,875
Here, use this one.

585
00:56:42,791 --> 00:56:44,500
Yes, wrap it three times...

586
00:56:57,791 --> 00:56:58,791
Janu...

587
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:01,916
Why did you avoid me yesterday?

588
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,583
Rana has returned,
and you still haven't come to see her.

589
00:57:04,666 --> 00:57:05,750
Why?

590
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,416
What is this?

591
00:57:22,208 --> 00:57:24,375
I can't go on living like this.

592
00:57:25,583 --> 00:57:27,916
I'm tired of being terrorized
by Rana every day.

593
00:57:49,291 --> 00:57:52,291
It was my fault.
I forced her to go uphill.

594
00:57:53,375 --> 00:57:56,208
But I didn't know it was her cursed day.

595
00:57:56,791 --> 00:57:59,000
- Careful, Ran.
- Okay.

596
00:58:05,833 --> 00:58:07,250
Be careful, Ran!

597
00:58:11,166 --> 00:58:12,333
Rana!

598
00:58:15,166 --> 00:58:16,458
Rana!

599
00:58:18,416 --> 00:58:19,708
Rana!

600
00:58:22,083 --> 00:58:24,166
Rana, Rana!

601
00:58:24,708 --> 00:58:25,958
Rana!

602
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:30,541
Rana!

603
00:58:32,875 --> 00:58:34,666
What? Are you confused?

604
00:58:36,458 --> 00:58:38,208
The girl in your house

605
00:58:39,291 --> 00:58:40,625
is not Rana.

606
00:58:41,375 --> 00:58:43,000
What do you mean, not Rana?

607
00:58:52,583 --> 00:58:55,375
When a person gets lost in the woods,

608
00:58:55,458 --> 00:58:59,666
the chance of them being alive
is ten percent.

609
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:02,666
Especially when they've been
gone for a week.

610
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:07,833
The only way for us to find Rana...

611
00:59:09,291 --> 00:59:10,875
She has to be cleansed.

612
00:59:12,375 --> 00:59:14,208
If you say the girl in my house
is not Rana,

613
00:59:15,833 --> 00:59:17,125
then who is she?

614
00:59:57,916 --> 01:00:00,083
The birth dates don't match!

615
01:00:04,041 --> 01:00:07,166
- This one...
- Don't show it to her.

616
01:00:39,916 --> 01:00:41,291
What is it, Sri?

617
01:00:43,916 --> 01:00:46,958
I miss Bagas.

618
01:00:50,583 --> 01:00:52,000
Me too.

619
01:01:41,541 --> 01:01:43,291
It's getting dangerous.

620
01:01:43,375 --> 01:01:44,916
It's getting dangerous!

621
01:01:45,541 --> 01:01:46,791
What is it, sis?

622
01:01:48,875 --> 01:01:52,041
All the evil spirits... they're coming!

623
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,958
What is it, sis?

624
01:01:56,583 --> 01:01:58,541
We should do a cleansing ritual for Rana.

625
01:01:59,083 --> 01:02:00,208
A cleansing ritual?

626
01:02:11,958 --> 01:02:14,041
Don't open the door.

627
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:16,833
It's okay.

628
01:02:16,916 --> 01:02:19,458
- Don't do it.
- It's okay.

629
01:02:51,375 --> 01:02:54,708
This is for Aunt Nur and all of you.

630
01:03:03,708 --> 01:03:04,875
Rana.

631
01:03:05,625 --> 01:03:08,583
If we hold a cleansing ceremony for you,
is that okay with you?

632
01:03:19,875 --> 01:03:21,875
According to the Primbon book,

633
01:03:23,625 --> 01:03:27,833
after someone has been cleansed,
they will become pure again.

634
01:03:28,708 --> 01:03:29,833
Then do it.

635
01:03:33,666 --> 01:03:34,791
I just don't understand.

636
01:03:35,291 --> 01:03:36,958
Why can't you all

637
01:03:39,625 --> 01:03:41,458
believe my mother?

638
01:03:51,458 --> 01:03:53,125
I should leave now.

639
01:03:54,791 --> 01:03:56,708
I hope you like the ketupat.

640
01:04:23,458 --> 01:04:26,416
We should not be afraid of Rana.

641
01:04:30,166 --> 01:04:34,125
We have to make Dini agree
to hold a cleansing ceremony.

642
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:16,333
We should hold a cleansing ceremony.

643
01:05:19,458 --> 01:05:21,666
You're living rent-free in this house.

644
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:24,291
I've made up my mind.

645
01:05:25,083 --> 01:05:26,958
I know I live rent-free here.

646
01:05:27,041 --> 01:05:29,833
I have never been accepted
by the family either.

647
01:05:31,541 --> 01:05:35,333
Because you refuse to become
a part of this family.

648
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:38,791
You should've never got married.

649
01:05:38,875 --> 01:05:43,000
Your birth dates are not a match.
That's bad luck.

650
01:05:43,791 --> 01:05:47,125
And you were born on the wrong date.

651
01:05:47,208 --> 01:05:48,958
A cursed one.

652
01:05:49,833 --> 01:05:54,708
And it is confirmed that you've brought
a curse upon our family.

653
01:05:54,791 --> 01:05:55,791
Sister.

654
01:05:55,875 --> 01:05:57,083
Now what?

655
01:05:58,041 --> 01:06:01,833
<i>After you two got married,
our mother passed away.</i>

656
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:05,250
<i>Now, you've lost your daughter.
You have to realize it.</i>

657
01:06:07,375 --> 01:06:10,958
You don't like me having come home either?

658
01:06:13,083 --> 01:06:15,208
<i>About that, I know it all too well.</i>

659
01:06:16,166 --> 01:06:18,666
From the moment I entered this house,

660
01:06:19,416 --> 01:06:20,666
this family,

661
01:06:21,416 --> 01:06:24,458
I've been judged to be the bearer of
misfortune. A magnet for bad luck.

662
01:06:24,541 --> 01:06:28,416
But don't ever bring up my daughter
in this conversation.

663
01:06:28,958 --> 01:06:31,750
<i>We have decided.</i>

664
01:07:09,208 --> 01:07:12,458
You can't see how your family
is paying for your ignorance.

665
01:07:14,416 --> 01:07:16,041
No, I can see it.

666
01:07:16,125 --> 01:07:19,583
But what do you know about my position?

667
01:07:19,666 --> 01:07:21,041
As a woman.

668
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:23,416
As a wife.

669
01:07:24,583 --> 01:07:26,125
As one who has carried her children
in her womb.

670
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:29,291
As one who has given birth.
Who has children.

671
01:07:29,375 --> 01:07:30,958
You know nothing about that!

672
01:07:31,791 --> 01:07:33,458
- Sis!
- How dare you?!

673
01:07:33,541 --> 01:07:34,958
- Sis Ning.
- You've crossed the line!

674
01:07:35,041 --> 01:07:36,666
- Enough.
- You're evil!

675
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:39,500
- That's unacceptable!
- Calm down, Sis Ning.

676
01:07:39,583 --> 01:07:41,208
- Calm down.
- I know I brought a curse with me!

677
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,083
I brought bad luck to this family!

678
01:07:44,166 --> 01:07:46,291
I married a bad match!

679
01:07:46,375 --> 01:07:50,583
You're a coward, Banyu!
You can't control your wife!

680
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:53,916
Calm down, sis. Calm down!

681
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,708
Let's do the cleansing ceremony tomorrow.

682
01:07:59,458 --> 01:08:06,458
- Poor Rana.
- Calm down, Din. Just let them.

683
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:08,458
Calm down.

684
01:08:10,916 --> 01:08:15,375
Please, let's just let them have
the cleansing ceremony, Din.

685
01:08:16,291 --> 01:08:17,291
Okay?

686
01:08:18,375 --> 01:08:21,000
No, honey.

687
01:08:21,083 --> 01:08:23,833
- If Rana is still alive...
- She is.

688
01:08:23,916 --> 01:08:28,416
- Then there's nothing to be afraid of.
- She's still alive.

689
01:10:13,083 --> 01:10:14,250
Aunt Nur.

690
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,916
Why are you so afraid of me?

691
01:11:00,791 --> 01:11:02,208
Tari.

692
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:03,291
Where are you going?

693
01:11:04,125 --> 01:11:04,875
To the woods.

694
01:11:06,583 --> 01:11:07,791
What are you gonna do in the woods?

695
01:11:07,875 --> 01:11:10,208
They say when we do
the cleansing ceremony,

696
01:11:10,291 --> 01:11:11,625
we will find her body, Uncle.

697
01:11:11,708 --> 01:11:13,500
That's just hearsay.

698
01:11:13,583 --> 01:11:15,666
Nobody can confirm the story.

699
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:17,875
What if your parents are looking for you?

700
01:11:17,958 --> 01:11:21,958
They'll be too busy with the ceremony.
Nobody will notice I'm not here.

701
01:11:23,916 --> 01:11:25,000
I know.

702
01:11:26,125 --> 01:11:27,958
You're feeling guilty, Janu.

703
01:11:30,291 --> 01:11:32,208
And you, Tari...

704
01:11:32,291 --> 01:11:34,291
You need to do something good.

705
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:37,041
But I think

706
01:11:37,125 --> 01:11:40,208
there's nothing for you to prove.

707
01:11:40,916 --> 01:11:42,333
But this is for Rana.

708
01:11:45,375 --> 01:11:47,041
We're running out of time, Uncle.

709
01:11:58,416 --> 01:11:59,958
Excuse me, Mr. Puppeteer.

710
01:12:00,875 --> 01:12:04,375
I will let my daughter, Rana,

711
01:12:05,083 --> 01:12:07,208
be cleansed.

712
01:12:08,208 --> 01:12:09,583
Thank you.

713
01:12:09,666 --> 01:12:11,791
I accept your request.

714
01:12:12,458 --> 01:12:18,375
Your daughter, Rana, will be cleansed

715
01:12:18,458 --> 01:12:20,375
the way it has to be done.

716
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:20,291
"Mr. Dalang Kanda Buwana."

717
01:14:21,208 --> 01:14:22,666
"Bathara Kala."

718
01:14:23,458 --> 01:14:26,666
"Yes, I'm here, Mr. Dalang."

719
01:14:27,958 --> 01:14:30,000
"Where are you going?"

720
01:14:30,083 --> 01:14:33,416
"I'm looking for a girl
who is the bearer of misfortune."

721
01:14:34,916 --> 01:14:39,458
"Rana, the bearer of misfortune,
has been offered to me."

722
01:14:40,291 --> 01:14:42,708
"That is impossible." "Why is that?"

723
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:47,875
"I will purify her soul with Murwa Kala."

724
01:14:49,041 --> 01:14:53,625
"If you think you can do it,
do it right now!"

725
01:16:13,333 --> 01:16:14,791
Where am I?

726
01:16:17,958 --> 01:16:19,000
You bastard.

727
01:17:54,875 --> 01:17:57,375
Honey?

728
01:17:58,166 --> 01:18:00,333
Honey, this is Mommy.

729
01:18:00,416 --> 01:18:02,083
Rana, this is Mommy.

730
01:18:02,166 --> 01:18:04,166
Wake up.

731
01:18:05,375 --> 01:18:07,166
Sis, please help!

732
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:09,041
What is happening?

733
01:18:16,208 --> 01:18:18,416
Sis, enough. Have mercy on her.

734
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:23,666
- Rana!
- Sis... Mom. Sis.

735
01:18:24,250 --> 01:18:26,750
This is Mommy. Mommy...

736
01:19:34,666 --> 01:19:35,666
Janu?

737
01:19:36,416 --> 01:19:37,625
Janu.

738
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:39,375
Janu!

739
01:19:40,833 --> 01:19:42,000
Janu!

740
01:19:43,083 --> 01:19:44,333
Janu!

741
01:19:45,875 --> 01:19:48,541
- Janu!
- Tari?

742
01:19:48,625 --> 01:19:49,750
Tari!

743
01:19:50,833 --> 01:19:52,083
- Janu!
- Tari!

744
01:20:04,166 --> 01:20:06,958
Janu!

745
01:20:07,041 --> 01:20:08,083
Tari!

746
01:20:08,833 --> 01:20:10,041
Tari!

747
01:20:14,583 --> 01:20:16,708
Janu! Janu!

748
01:20:18,541 --> 01:20:20,000
Tari!

749
01:20:21,708 --> 01:20:22,916
Tari!

750
01:20:25,625 --> 01:20:27,000
Honey.

751
01:20:27,083 --> 01:20:28,291
Janu?

752
01:20:32,083 --> 01:20:33,291
Janu!

753
01:20:34,333 --> 01:20:35,708
Janu!

754
01:21:50,958 --> 01:21:52,000
Tari!

755
01:21:55,541 --> 01:21:56,708
Tari!

756
01:21:57,625 --> 01:21:58,916
Tari!

757
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,583
Tari?

758
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:02,291
Tari?

759
01:22:47,083 --> 01:22:48,541
Rana.

760
01:22:55,125 --> 01:22:59,583
Rana is dead! Uncle! Banyu!

761
01:22:59,666 --> 01:23:01,750
Hey, sir!

762
01:23:01,833 --> 01:23:03,875
Sir! We found her!

763
01:23:03,958 --> 01:23:05,375
Sir! Ma'am!

764
01:24:41,166 --> 01:24:45,666
<i>Mom, I was going to give
this special gift to you.</i>

765
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:49,750
But the weather today is bad.

766
01:24:54,291 --> 01:24:55,750
Happy birthday, Mom.

767
01:24:56,666 --> 01:25:00,291
I know you're the strongest person
in the world.

768
01:25:01,416 --> 01:25:06,083
That's why I also know,
we're all going to be all right.

769
01:25:07,083 --> 01:25:08,666
Because I have you.

770
01:25:09,791 --> 01:25:11,833
And you will always have me.

771
01:25:14,083 --> 01:25:16,000
Even when you are alone,

772
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:21,125
I know you're the strongest of them all.

773
01:25:22,208 --> 01:25:28,083
Don't ever listen to anyone who tells you
that your birthday is on a cursed date.

774
01:25:29,333 --> 01:25:32,250
All the facts show we're all going
to be fine, right, Mom?

775
01:25:34,750 --> 01:25:36,333
Happy birthday, Mom.

776
01:25:37,208 --> 01:25:39,458
Please keep this video.

777
01:25:39,541 --> 01:25:41,375
Because I want you to know

778
01:25:43,041 --> 01:25:45,958
that I will always be with you.

779
01:25:47,125 --> 01:25:49,125
I will always be beside you.

780
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:52,333
I wish you all the best, Mom.

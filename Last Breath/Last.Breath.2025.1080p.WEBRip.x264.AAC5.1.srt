3
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:56,654
<i>Storm Yulee continues</i>
<i>its way across the UK,</i>

4
00:02:56,828 --> 00:02:58,656
<i>prompting a rare</i>
<i>red weather warning</i>

5
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,963

7
00:03:27,468 --> 00:03:28,947
Hiya.

8
00:03:29,905 --> 00:03:31,602
Hi.

9
00:03:33,604 --> 00:03:35,519
They want me.

10
00:03:35,693 --> 00:03:37,478
Tomorrow at Clipper Quay.

11
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:40,829
That's great.

12
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,614
Gives you a month without me
getting in the way

13
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:45,616
- of all this stuff.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah.

14
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,183
I'll probably have
the whole place framed up

15
00:03:47,357 --> 00:03:48,402
by the time you're back.

16
00:03:48,576 --> 00:03:51,796
Good. I want video updates.

17
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,929
I want reports.
I want to hear all about it.

18
00:03:54,103 --> 00:03:55,757
Yeah. You'll get them.

19
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:57,889
Daily.

20
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:03,460
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

21
00:04:04,853 --> 00:04:06,246
I know.

22
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,378
Just remember, it's, uh...

23
00:04:08,552 --> 00:04:11,686
it's like going into space
but it's underwater.

24
00:04:13,383 --> 00:04:15,864
What's hilarious is you think
I find that comforting.

25
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:19,563
Humans shouldn't be
at the bottom of the North Sea.

26
00:04:19,737 --> 00:04:21,565
I know. I know.

27
00:04:23,045 --> 00:04:25,003
But it is pretty cool.

28
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:29,660
It's a good thing you're cute.

29
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:31,314
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

30
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:32,794
- Cute?
- Mm-hmm.

31
00:04:32,968 --> 00:04:35,492
Your cute, cool diver boyfriend?

32
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:36,972
Husband? Fiancé?

33
00:05:24,193 --> 00:05:26,456
Uh, Chris Lemons,
one of the divers.

34
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,502
- Chris Lemons?
- Yeah.

35
00:05:34,943 --> 00:05:36,640
- Hey.
- Hey.

36
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:40,252
- You all right, guys?
- You all right, mate?

37
00:05:40,427 --> 00:05:41,993
How's it going?

38
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,312
- Oh, morning, Craig.
- Chris.

39
00:05:56,486 --> 00:05:57,922
I'm just gonna find out
about the job.

40
00:05:58,096 --> 00:06:00,098
- I'll tell you later.
- All right.

41
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,493
Duncan.

42
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:05,190
Hello, handsome.

43
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,540
What you got for me?

44
00:06:06,714 --> 00:06:08,542
Well, I hear we got
a new captain.

45
00:06:08,716 --> 00:06:11,196
Oh, yeah? Let's hope this one
doesn't cancel Christmas, eh?

46
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,676
Yeah, right?

47
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,374
- Nice to see you.
- How's the house coming?

48
00:06:14,548 --> 00:06:15,984
- You finish my room?
- Yeah, it's going good.

49
00:06:16,158 --> 00:06:17,377
I think we're gonna
paint it pink.

50
00:06:17,551 --> 00:06:18,508
Is that okay?

51
00:06:18,682 --> 00:06:21,990
Or green or purple or...

52
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:24,993
Pink is actually...
that's a beautiful color.

53
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:26,777
You know, a lot of people
think it's feminine.

54
00:06:26,951 --> 00:06:27,952
Where you going?

55
00:06:36,221 --> 00:06:37,788
Just taking two bottles
of hot sauce.

56
00:06:37,962 --> 00:06:39,442
Okay.

57
00:06:46,797 --> 00:06:48,320
Hey, Stu.

58
00:06:48,495 --> 00:06:49,931
Seen how much helium
they're loading on board?

59
00:06:50,105 --> 00:06:52,455
Hmm. It's gonna be a deep one.

60
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:54,718
Deeper the better, I suppose.

61
00:07:03,597 --> 00:07:05,425
That's 200 feet.

62
00:07:15,043 --> 00:07:16,305
- Hey.
- Huh?

63
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,525
- Morning, Chris.
- Made the cut.

64
00:07:21,397 --> 00:07:23,965
Yep! Easy there.

65
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:49,686
You all right, lads?

66
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,384
- How's it going?
- Hi, Chris. Good to see you.

67
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,476
So you heard who's on board?

68
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,216
Who's that?

69
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,784
The Vulcan, diver one himself.

70
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,394
Oh, yeah?

71
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:04,396
I was starting to think
he was just a myth.

72
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:08,836
Well, should be a fun sat
if you're on his team.

73
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,315
Excited to get in there.

74
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,969
Yeah, I bet.

75
00:08:20,282 --> 00:08:21,631
Okay.

76
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:26,331
You lot are gonna be living
in our glamorous tin cans

77
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,159
for the next 28 days,

78
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:31,467
where you'll be pressurized
down to 300 feet.

79
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:33,600
You're gonna be my hands
on the seabed

80
00:08:33,774 --> 00:08:35,427
replacing a section of pipeline.

81
00:08:35,602 --> 00:08:37,560
Can't have the gas flow
interrupted,

82
00:08:37,734 --> 00:08:40,258
or people's homes will go cold
this winter.

83
00:08:40,432 --> 00:08:43,479
Once the job's done, you'll
have four days decompression

84
00:08:43,653 --> 00:08:45,612
when your hands can do
whatever they want.

85
00:08:47,396 --> 00:08:51,139
Okay.
Team C: Nick, Alex and Paul.

86
00:08:51,313 --> 00:08:55,317
Team B is Stu, Kirk and Brad.

87
00:08:56,361 --> 00:09:00,104
Team A is Duncan, with Chris

88
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:04,108
and that bundle of joy there.

89
00:09:05,109 --> 00:09:07,372
Right, I'm starting blowdown
before departure.

90
00:09:08,373 --> 00:09:11,855
Doors close in ten minutes,
so get cracking.

91
00:09:14,249 --> 00:09:16,599
David, it's Chris.
Nice to meet you.

92
00:09:16,773 --> 00:09:18,122
Just Dave.

93
00:09:18,296 --> 00:09:19,689
Dave. Sorry.

94
00:09:19,863 --> 00:09:21,604
Uh, looking forward
to doing sat with you.

95
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:23,563
Yep. See you in there.

96
00:09:24,607 --> 00:09:26,783
Yeah, see you in there.

97
00:09:26,957 --> 00:09:29,177
- See you in there, Duncs.
- Yeah.

98
00:09:33,268 --> 00:09:36,140
Yeah. I see you made Chris
feel nice and welcome.

99
00:09:36,314 --> 00:09:38,752
How is the kid, anyway?

100
00:09:38,926 --> 00:09:40,231
Solid.

101
00:09:40,405 --> 00:09:42,451
He, uh, worked as a deckhand

102
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,758
for three years
before he got the nod,

103
00:09:44,932 --> 00:09:49,066
but then he did
his first five dives with me,

104
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,549
and as we both know, I am
the finest sat daddy around.

105
00:09:55,551 --> 00:09:57,292
Good.

106
00:09:59,642 --> 00:10:02,253
"Sat daddy"? Really?

107
00:10:02,427 --> 00:10:04,821
That sounds strange
coming out of your mouth.

108
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:29,411
As an old man,
I find I'm a bottom-bunk guy,

109
00:10:29,585 --> 00:10:31,543
you know, just in case
Mother Nature calls.

110
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,461
Your, uh... your wife?

111
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,507
Uh, no. Fiancée.

112
00:10:40,465 --> 00:10:43,468
Word of advice:
Once that door closes,

113
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,645
everything outside
is just a distraction.

114
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,084
Keep your focus
where it needs to be, yeah?

115
00:10:55,002 --> 00:10:58,048
Hey. Don't worry about him.

116
00:10:59,615 --> 00:11:01,965
He's a grizzly when he's here,
but, you know,

117
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:04,576
once he gets home,
he's a real softie.

118
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:07,536
He's just daddy
to his two little girls.

119
00:11:09,146 --> 00:11:11,105
Christ, you got
enough chocolate there?

120
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,065
Just enough for one a day.

121
00:11:16,588 --> 00:11:19,635
Divers, are we good
to lock the doors?

122
00:11:22,986 --> 00:11:25,597
Team A standing by.

123
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,078
Team B standing by.

124
00:11:28,252 --> 00:11:30,211
Team C standing by.

125
00:11:31,212 --> 00:11:33,780
Doors closing now.

126
00:11:42,136 --> 00:11:45,182
Doors closed. Stairs away.

127
00:11:45,356 --> 00:11:48,403
96.4% helium. 3.6% oxygen.

128
00:11:48,577 --> 00:11:49,970
Gas ratios confirmed.

129
00:11:50,144 --> 00:11:51,667
I'm turning on the taps, boys.

130
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:53,756
Let's go for a ride.

131
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,002
I'll never get used to this.

132
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:23,743
What?

133
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:14,027
Here we find ourselves

134
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:16,290
at the bottom of the world.

135
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:20,511
You are now able to operate

136
00:14:20,685 --> 00:14:23,340
at 300 feet below sea level,

137
00:14:23,514 --> 00:14:26,691
where it will be pitch black
and bloody cold.

138
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,607
And remember, should you step
outside the chamber

139
00:14:29,781 --> 00:14:32,001
prior to decompression,

140
00:14:32,175 --> 00:14:35,048
the gas now saturating
every cell in your body

141
00:14:35,222 --> 00:14:37,050
will expand so rapidly

142
00:14:37,224 --> 00:14:40,618
your vital organs
will quite literally explode.

143
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:42,707
He says that every time.

144
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:46,624
How you feeling, Duncan?

145
00:14:46,798 --> 00:14:48,713
Aces, amigo.

146
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,411
Aces.

147
00:14:50,585 --> 00:14:52,543
Chris, Dave, you okay?

148
00:14:55,155 --> 00:14:57,244
All right,
I'm gonna get some rest.

149
00:14:57,418 --> 00:14:59,899
I'll see you
when we come on station.

150
00:15:20,354 --> 00:15:21,746
Grub's up.

151
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,574
For God's sake,
show some modesty.

152
00:15:23,748 --> 00:15:25,533
Cover yourself.

153
00:15:30,712 --> 00:15:33,410
Back in the day, though,
you know,

154
00:15:33,584 --> 00:15:37,197
when I was starting out,
you only needed two things:

155
00:15:37,371 --> 00:15:40,591
little common sense
and a good bottle of Scotch.

156
00:15:40,765 --> 00:15:41,941
Here we go.

157
00:15:42,115 --> 00:15:44,117
It really was the Wild West.

158
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,293
Thank God it's not
like that anymore.

159
00:15:47,903 --> 00:15:49,644
Yeah.

160
00:15:49,818 --> 00:15:53,126
I guess I'm the last of my kind.

161
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,911
Kind of a relic.

162
00:15:56,085 --> 00:15:58,870
Which explains why they're
putting me out to pasture.

163
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:04,050
What are you talking about?

164
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:07,923
Well, the company,
in its infinite wisdom,

165
00:16:08,097 --> 00:16:10,534
has decided 20 years
is enough for me

166
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:14,103
and, uh, you know,
this will be my last rotation.

167
00:16:17,106 --> 00:16:19,326
Really? Wh-Why didn't you
say something?

168
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:25,158
Because I don't want everybody
making a fuss, you know,

169
00:16:25,332 --> 00:16:27,116
before going in.

170
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,771
You okay?
Is everything all right?

171
00:16:29,945 --> 00:16:31,512
Yeah. You kidding?

172
00:16:31,686 --> 00:16:35,298
It'll be great
to have some free time.

173
00:16:35,472 --> 00:16:38,040
You know, I'll take up golf.

174
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:41,652
But I did think that I had
maybe ten more years left.

175
00:16:41,826 --> 00:16:44,003
Or more.

176
00:16:45,569 --> 00:16:47,049
If it's any consolation,

177
00:16:47,223 --> 00:16:48,790
there's a high possibility
that all of our jobs

178
00:16:48,964 --> 00:16:52,098
will have been automated
in ten years, so...

179
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:56,276
Oh, yeah, that does
console me, Dave. Thank you.

180
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,973
You're welcome.

181
00:16:58,147 --> 00:16:59,714
Well, I tried.

182
00:16:59,888 --> 00:17:01,237
All right. I'm going to bed.

183
00:17:01,411 --> 00:17:03,848
-Night.
-Nighty night.

184
00:17:07,243 --> 00:17:09,202
So this is our last sat
together, then.

185
00:17:10,203 --> 00:17:12,770
Yeah.
I can't believe it, either.

186
00:17:18,341 --> 00:17:21,083
Why don't you pull a Craig,

187
00:17:21,257 --> 00:17:23,259
get in the hot seat,
call the shots?

188
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:24,956
What?

189
00:17:25,131 --> 00:17:26,567
No.

190
00:17:26,741 --> 00:17:29,439
I-I am not management material.

191
00:17:29,613 --> 00:17:30,919
And I don't think I could handle

192
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:32,790
watching you guys
have all the fun.

193
00:17:32,964 --> 00:17:35,663
Yeah, fair enough.

194
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:39,362
Hey. Look.

195
00:17:39,536 --> 00:17:42,409
You are a great diver.

196
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,802
You don't need me around
anymore.

197
00:18:09,044 --> 00:18:11,046
Right,
so the church holds 80 people

198
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,181
and the village hall
next door 150.

199
00:18:15,355 --> 00:18:18,097
So, as long as we un-invite
half my cousins,

200
00:18:18,271 --> 00:18:19,489
we should be fine.

201
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:22,536
What else?

202
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,930
Well, I'm looking
really cute today.

203
00:18:29,673 --> 00:18:31,371
Do you miss me?

204
00:18:32,676 --> 00:18:33,808
Nah.

205
00:18:33,982 --> 00:18:35,505
You're having more fun

206
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,377
helping Duncan
with his crosswords.

207
00:18:38,378 --> 00:18:39,857
Bye.

208
00:19:01,401 --> 00:19:03,881
<i>Marine Control, this is</i>
<i>dive support vessel</i>Tharos...

209
00:19:04,055 --> 00:19:05,883
- Cap.
- ...arriving 127 miles

210
00:19:06,057 --> 00:19:08,451
east of Aberdeen
at Huntington Oil Field.

211
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,236
Thank you very much, <i>Tharos.</i>

212
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,628
We're gonna be
right in the middle

213
00:19:11,802 --> 00:19:13,413
of this storm system all night.

214
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:17,243
What do you think?

215
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:22,726
Well, it's borderline, Cap,
but this is the North Sea.

216
00:19:26,077 --> 00:19:28,341
Dynamic positioning status?

217
00:19:28,515 --> 00:19:32,649
Coming over dive site,
turning into swell.

218
00:19:32,823 --> 00:19:34,738
Directional thrusters
holding our position

219
00:19:34,912 --> 00:19:36,697
<i>next to the manifold.</i>

220
00:19:42,877 --> 00:19:44,444
Locked on.

221
00:19:44,618 --> 00:19:46,054
Dynamic
positioning system online.

222
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:47,882
Computers have it from here.

223
00:19:48,056 --> 00:19:50,101
Prepare for diving operations.

224
00:19:51,277 --> 00:19:52,582
All right.

225
00:19:52,756 --> 00:19:54,367
Team A up first.

226
00:19:56,412 --> 00:19:57,935
Rise and shine, boys.

227
00:19:58,109 --> 00:20:00,764
This is your one hour's notice.

228
00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:08,207
- Dave?
-Hmm?

229
00:20:08,381 --> 00:20:11,340
You want to pop down here
for a five-minute cuddle?

230
00:20:11,514 --> 00:20:12,776
I'm, uh...

231
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,343
I'm good, Duncan. Thank you.

232
00:20:14,517 --> 00:20:16,824
All right. Thanks for pondering.

233
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,044
Thank you, sir.

234
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,568
You're welcome.

235
00:20:21,742 --> 00:20:24,527
All right,
Team A entering wet pot

236
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:27,182
for final pressing in.

237
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:38,454
What about your tools?

238
00:20:38,628 --> 00:20:40,151
Got your knife, compass,

239
00:20:40,326 --> 00:20:42,502
- your flares?
-Yeah.

240
00:20:43,981 --> 00:20:45,505
What about you, Dave?

241
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,724
Need a hand?

242
00:20:47,898 --> 00:20:49,378
Didn't think so. All right.

243
00:20:49,552 --> 00:20:51,728
See you guys up top.

244
00:20:51,902 --> 00:20:53,991
Right. Thanks.

245
00:21:00,346 --> 00:21:03,523
Dive Control,
first one in the bell.

246
00:21:06,352 --> 00:21:07,918
You good?

247
00:21:08,092 --> 00:21:10,312
- Yeah.
- Hey.

248
00:21:10,486 --> 00:21:12,358
We're on the job now, okay?

249
00:21:12,532 --> 00:21:14,534
Once we're down there,
it's just the two of us.

250
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,146
- Follow my lead.
- Mm-hmm.

251
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,977
Up you come, Dave.

252
00:21:26,981 --> 00:21:29,549
Second man in the bell.

253
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:40,821
Dive Control,
that's three in the bell.

254
00:21:40,995 --> 00:21:42,518
All right, copy that.

255
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,834
Positioning bell.

256
00:21:57,272 --> 00:21:59,361
Lifting off sat chamber now.

257
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:11,765
And... bell over moon pool.

258
00:22:17,248 --> 00:22:18,119
ROV.

259
00:22:18,293 --> 00:22:20,513
Eyes on.

260
00:22:32,873 --> 00:22:34,614
Starting descent.

261
00:22:35,702 --> 00:22:36,746
Steady on two.

262
00:22:49,106 --> 00:22:52,283
Bell left surface at 2117.

263
00:23:07,168 --> 00:23:09,605
Bell passing through 100 feet.

264
00:23:20,486 --> 00:23:22,401
That's 200 feet.

265
00:23:39,026 --> 00:23:42,333
And... at depth.

266
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,379
300 feet.

267
00:23:46,207 --> 00:23:47,556
Bell, go for your door.

268
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:51,821
Copy that, Dive Control.

269
00:24:06,009 --> 00:24:08,534
Wow. That is some swell.

270
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:11,667
That-that's got to be
20-foot seas up there.

271
00:24:11,841 --> 00:24:17,281
Bell, it pains me, but that's
what I've got up here, too.

272
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:20,241
What can I say, boys?
Still got it.

273
00:24:20,415 --> 00:24:22,069
Every bloody time.

274
00:24:22,243 --> 00:24:23,462
Okay, come on. Let's go.

275
00:24:23,636 --> 00:24:27,204
Turning on hot water feed.

276
00:24:31,165 --> 00:24:33,297
Coming to temperature now.

277
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,778
It's like a bath.

278
00:24:35,952 --> 00:24:37,954
You want me falling asleep
on the job?

279
00:24:38,128 --> 00:24:40,870
It's two degrees
above freezing down there.

280
00:24:41,044 --> 00:24:43,569
But I forgot
how you like to suffer.

281
00:24:45,614 --> 00:24:46,920
Yeah, that's good.

282
00:24:49,313 --> 00:24:50,750
Going in.

283
00:24:53,361 --> 00:24:54,623
The hat.

284
00:24:55,624 --> 00:24:57,365
Mains gas supply on.

285
00:25:04,111 --> 00:25:06,069
And connected.

286
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,247
Lowering hat.

287
00:25:10,421 --> 00:25:11,727
Hand on the hat.

288
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,775
Grip the hat lower.

289
00:25:15,949 --> 00:25:19,039
Okay. It's all yours.

290
00:25:19,213 --> 00:25:21,041
-Good?
-Hat's on.

291
00:25:25,088 --> 00:25:27,047
Comms check. Comms check.

292
00:25:28,048 --> 00:25:29,397
Comms clear.

293
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:31,747
Bellman to Dive Control.
How's your feed?

294
00:25:31,921 --> 00:25:33,401
Yes, coming through.

295
00:25:33,575 --> 00:25:37,013
Uh, Duncan,
this is gonna be a long shift.

296
00:25:37,187 --> 00:25:39,886
I just want to confirm
your adult diaper is on.

297
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,062
That's good material.

298
00:25:42,236 --> 00:25:44,804
You know, you and I
are the same age.

299
00:25:44,978 --> 00:25:47,328
And by the way,
I'm a professional.

300
00:25:47,502 --> 00:25:52,246
I haven't had an irregular
bowel movement since '95.

301
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,291
Okay. Let's do it.

302
00:25:54,465 --> 00:25:56,467
Bailouts coming down.

303
00:25:57,991 --> 00:25:59,775
-All right.
-Yep.

304
00:25:59,949 --> 00:26:01,124
Okay.

305
00:26:02,082 --> 00:26:03,562
Diver good?

306
00:26:04,084 --> 00:26:05,259
Good.

307
00:26:20,883 --> 00:26:23,973
That's diver one
in the water at 300 feet.

308
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,629
Bell, turn on lights
for diver one.

309
00:26:29,762 --> 00:26:31,198
Working.

310
00:26:43,384 --> 00:26:44,994
In you go.

311
00:26:53,742 --> 00:26:55,614
Diver one dropping off bell.

312
00:27:10,063 --> 00:27:12,935
Okay. Gas flow's good.

313
00:27:13,109 --> 00:27:14,981
Umbilical's connected.

314
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:19,289
You're locked in.

315
00:27:19,463 --> 00:27:21,161
Comms check. Comms check.

316
00:27:21,335 --> 00:27:23,119
Loud and clear.

317
00:27:23,293 --> 00:27:25,121
Are you good to go?

318
00:27:25,295 --> 00:27:26,949
I'll see you in six hours.

319
00:27:27,123 --> 00:27:29,038
Okay. Stay safe, brother.

320
00:27:48,188 --> 00:27:51,757
Diver two in the water
at 305 feet.

321
00:27:56,326 --> 00:27:59,155
Slow your breathing
down a little for me, okay?

322
00:28:01,984 --> 00:28:03,507
Copy.

323
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:09,296
Diver two dropping off bell.

324
00:28:27,401 --> 00:28:29,403
Touchdown, diver two.

325
00:28:34,103 --> 00:28:36,149
Bell, bearing to the job?

326
00:28:46,289 --> 00:28:48,639
Bell, bearing to the job?

327
00:28:48,814 --> 00:28:52,339
Diver two
is zero nine zero degrees.

328
00:28:57,561 --> 00:28:59,172
It's this way.

329
00:29:23,283 --> 00:29:25,111
Cap, both divers are on-site.

330
00:29:25,285 --> 00:29:26,982
Lower the power cable.

331
00:29:27,156 --> 00:29:29,289
Copy that.

332
00:29:37,384 --> 00:29:38,646
Approaching seabed.

333
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,691
Duncan, notify the divers,
would you?

334
00:29:40,866 --> 00:29:42,389
Copy.

335
00:29:42,563 --> 00:29:45,305
Divers, power cable
approaching seabed.

336
00:29:47,002 --> 00:29:48,656
Copy that, bell.

337
00:29:57,665 --> 00:29:59,580
I have the connector.

338
00:29:59,754 --> 00:30:01,800
Moving toward manifold now.

339
00:30:17,685 --> 00:30:19,730
Bell, manifold has power.

340
00:30:23,343 --> 00:30:26,259
Diver one,
prep pipes for installation.

341
00:30:26,433 --> 00:30:28,087
-Copy that.
-Diver two,

342
00:30:28,261 --> 00:30:30,916
head for well three
to begin equalization.

343
00:30:31,917 --> 00:30:33,962
Copy that.
Entering the manifold.

344
00:30:37,531 --> 00:30:40,229
Bell, all looking good
from up here.

345
00:30:47,236 --> 00:30:49,238
How's it looking, diver two?

346
00:30:50,718 --> 00:30:52,502
There's, uh,
rust on the stanchions.

347
00:30:52,676 --> 00:30:54,591
There's growth everywhere.

348
00:30:56,593 --> 00:30:58,595
Visibility's not great.

349
00:31:02,338 --> 00:31:04,863
Oh, I need to cut down
on my desserts.

350
00:31:10,956 --> 00:31:13,523
We just lost our hydroacoustics.

351
00:31:15,134 --> 00:31:17,136
Are we still in position?

352
00:31:19,312 --> 00:31:20,922
Troubleshooting now.

353
00:31:27,102 --> 00:31:29,235
Bell, I've got a reading of, uh,

354
00:31:29,409 --> 00:31:31,802
over a thousand psi
on wellhead three.

355
00:31:31,977 --> 00:31:33,500
That's way too high.

356
00:31:33,674 --> 00:31:36,372
All right.
Let me try and work my magic.

357
00:31:52,823 --> 00:31:55,391
Warning. Warning.

358
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:57,872
Warning.

359
00:31:58,046 --> 00:31:59,569
Cap, the thrusters
have gone offline.

360
00:31:59,743 --> 00:32:01,267
- How many?
- All of them.

361
00:32:01,441 --> 00:32:03,660
I'm getting the same here, Cap.

362
00:32:13,322 --> 00:32:14,889
Chris? The ship's moving.

363
00:32:15,063 --> 00:32:16,673
Get out of there now.

364
00:32:16,847 --> 00:32:18,588
What? Dave, can you repeat?

365
00:32:18,762 --> 00:32:20,460
The ship is moving.

366
00:32:20,634 --> 00:32:23,332
Get out of the manifold
right now.

367
00:32:25,595 --> 00:32:27,206
Copy that.

368
00:32:34,778 --> 00:32:35,910
Warning. Warning.

369
00:32:36,084 --> 00:32:37,259
Dynamic positioning system...

370
00:32:37,433 --> 00:32:39,740
I'm losing everything here.

371
00:32:39,914 --> 00:32:41,698
- Where's our power?
-Dead in the water.

372
00:32:41,872 --> 00:32:43,918
Cap, we're drifting
out of control.

373
00:32:44,092 --> 00:32:45,659
Abort. Abort.

374
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:47,443
We have a runoff.

375
00:32:47,617 --> 00:32:49,576
Get the divers as much
umbilical as possible, Duncan.

376
00:32:51,578 --> 00:32:54,320
Chris, our umbilicals
are over the manifold.

377
00:32:54,494 --> 00:32:57,758
We've got to use them
to climb to the top.

378
00:33:02,937 --> 00:33:04,156
Chris,
you've got to really move.

379
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:06,158
Yeah. Yeah, I'm coming.
I'm coming.

380
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:23,088
Divers, where are you?

381
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,617
Diver one
on top of the manifold.

382
00:33:33,837 --> 00:33:36,884
Bell, I-I don't have
eyes on you.

383
00:33:39,974 --> 00:33:42,933
Diver two also on top.

384
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:00,125
My umbilical's snagged.

385
00:34:03,563 --> 00:34:06,000
The wind's spinning us around.

386
00:34:06,174 --> 00:34:08,437
Power cable's about to give!

387
00:34:15,662 --> 00:34:19,796
Dive Control, there's
no umbilical left in the bell.

388
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:21,842
That's everything I've got.

389
00:34:35,464 --> 00:34:36,944
The ship's not drifting.

390
00:34:38,685 --> 00:34:40,078
That's why.
Look, it's being pulled tight.

391
00:34:40,904 --> 00:34:42,384
Chris has become our anchor.

392
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:47,172
That's never gonna hold.
It'll snap.

393
00:34:54,483 --> 00:34:56,311
Bell, I need slack
on diver one.

394
00:34:57,356 --> 00:34:59,271
There is no more slack.

395
00:35:01,403 --> 00:35:02,796
I can't get to you.

396
00:35:10,064 --> 00:35:11,283
My gas supply.

397
00:35:11,457 --> 00:35:12,849
I can't breathe.

398
00:35:16,853 --> 00:35:19,160
Chris, switch to your bailout.

399
00:35:19,334 --> 00:35:22,163
Hey, Chris. On me.

400
00:35:22,337 --> 00:35:24,818
Switch to your bailout.

401
00:35:30,737 --> 00:35:32,173
Good.

402
00:35:34,393 --> 00:35:35,524
Good.

403
00:35:36,177 --> 00:35:37,961
Now take slow, deep breaths.

404
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,312
Otherwise, you'll burn
through your backup gas.

405
00:35:40,486 --> 00:35:41,661
Understand?

406
00:35:43,837 --> 00:35:45,708
Dive Control?

407
00:35:45,882 --> 00:35:48,015
Diver two is on bailouts.

408
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,454
How much gas does he have left?

409
00:35:52,628 --> 00:35:54,282
Ten minutes.

410
00:36:00,201 --> 00:36:01,985
What happens now?

411
00:36:03,987 --> 00:36:06,773
Your umbilical, it's gonna snap.

412
00:36:08,383 --> 00:36:10,429
You'll get pulled off
the structure.

413
00:36:12,082 --> 00:36:14,911
Now, I will come back for you,

414
00:36:15,085 --> 00:36:17,784
but you have to do
something for me, okay?

415
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:22,223
You have to get yourself back
to the top of the manifold.

416
00:36:22,397 --> 00:36:24,312
I can't rescue you
if I can't find you.

417
00:36:24,486 --> 00:36:25,618
Understand?

418
00:36:28,621 --> 00:36:30,188
J-Just make sure I'm...

419
00:36:52,732 --> 00:36:54,777
Chris, are you there?
Do you copy?

420
00:36:55,996 --> 00:36:57,824
Chris?

421
00:36:57,998 --> 00:36:59,782
Chris, are you there?

422
00:37:01,436 --> 00:37:04,178
Bell? Bell, do you copy?

423
00:37:04,352 --> 00:37:06,789
Coming back to you now.

424
00:38:00,408 --> 00:38:03,629
No eyes or ears
on divers or bell.

425
00:38:03,803 --> 00:38:05,500
Condition unknown.

426
00:38:13,552 --> 00:38:15,641
ROV feed is back online.

427
00:38:15,815 --> 00:38:18,165
Uh, can you get closer?

428
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:20,602
Dave has made it back
to the bell.

429
00:38:34,529 --> 00:38:36,879
Duncan, if you can hear me,

430
00:38:37,053 --> 00:38:38,794
I'm back on the stage.

431
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,027
What happened?

432
00:38:54,201 --> 00:38:56,464
His umbilical snapped.

433
00:38:57,726 --> 00:38:59,685
He's gone.

434
00:39:13,263 --> 00:39:15,265
There's no news on Chris.

435
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,180
But we're keeping the bell down

436
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:20,053
for when we get back
control of the ship.

437
00:39:20,227 --> 00:39:22,272
We'll update you as and when.

438
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,927
Cap?

439
00:39:25,101 --> 00:39:28,366
Why don't we drop anchor,
stop us drifting any further?

440
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,977
We don't have control
of the ship.

441
00:39:31,151 --> 00:39:32,935
There are acres of oil pipeline
down there.

442
00:39:33,109 --> 00:39:35,590
The anchor could snag
any one of them and rupture it.

443
00:39:35,764 --> 00:39:38,854
There's far more seabed
than there is pipeline.

444
00:39:39,028 --> 00:39:40,378
If we don't drop it now,
there's no telling

445
00:39:40,552 --> 00:39:42,380
how far we'll end up from Chris.

446
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:47,515
I can't risk
an environmental disaster.

447
00:39:49,038 --> 00:39:50,910
We'll have to find another way.

448
00:40:27,773 --> 00:40:29,731
Duncan!

449
00:40:29,905 --> 00:40:31,907
Dave?

450
00:40:32,908 --> 00:40:34,910
Duncan, I can't see you.

451
00:40:42,527 --> 00:40:44,485
Duncan, I don't know where I am.

452
00:40:57,193 --> 00:40:59,544
Mani... man-manifold. Manifold.

453
00:41:01,502 --> 00:41:02,764
Okay.

454
00:41:02,938 --> 00:41:04,984
Okay, 90 degrees.

455
00:41:05,158 --> 00:41:06,768
90 degrees.

456
00:41:08,814 --> 00:41:10,859
Okay. Okay.

457
00:41:11,033 --> 00:41:12,818
Shit.

458
00:41:23,002 --> 00:41:24,786
Find the manifold.

459
00:41:26,092 --> 00:41:27,180
Find the manifold.

460
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:30,488
Manifold.

461
00:41:31,706 --> 00:41:33,099
Manifold.

462
00:41:42,891 --> 00:41:43,849
Bridge?

463
00:41:44,023 --> 00:41:45,372
We've run the diagnostics.

464
00:41:45,546 --> 00:41:46,678
There's no fault
with the thrusters.

465
00:41:46,852 --> 00:41:47,983
Are you sure?

466
00:41:48,157 --> 00:41:49,855
One hundred percent.

467
00:41:50,029 --> 00:41:51,509
We've run them twice.

468
00:41:54,816 --> 00:41:56,252
If the thrusters
are still working,

469
00:41:56,426 --> 00:41:57,819
we can take
the computers offline

470
00:41:57,993 --> 00:41:59,517
and control her manually.

471
00:41:59,691 --> 00:42:02,432
Cap, this system is designed
to be used only in port,

472
00:42:02,607 --> 00:42:05,261
never in conditions
anything like this.

473
00:42:05,435 --> 00:42:07,481
I understand.

474
00:42:09,309 --> 00:42:13,356
If we make a mistake,
we put the entire ship at risk.

475
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:17,230
Okay, but if we keep drifting,
there's no way of telling

476
00:42:17,404 --> 00:42:19,754
how far we'll get
from diver number two.

477
00:42:19,928 --> 00:42:22,191
From Chris.

478
00:42:27,893 --> 00:42:30,025
And I can't do this without you.

479
00:42:37,293 --> 00:42:38,686
Listen up.

480
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:41,297
Until the dynamic positioning
is back online,

481
00:42:41,471 --> 00:42:43,909
the first officer
and myself will...

482
00:42:44,083 --> 00:42:45,650
take control
of the ship manually

483
00:42:45,824 --> 00:42:48,000
and stop us from drifting
any further.

484
00:42:48,174 --> 00:42:51,481
DPO, put her in manual.

485
00:42:54,441 --> 00:42:55,964
Thrusters in manual.

486
00:43:02,144 --> 00:43:06,409
Port, one four zero degrees
at 30%.

487
00:43:13,112 --> 00:43:14,679
Stern 40.

488
00:43:14,853 --> 00:43:16,202
-Stern 40.
-Now.

489
00:43:25,124 --> 00:43:27,082
Moving off drift line.

490
00:43:27,256 --> 00:43:31,304
Distance to dive site
is 630 feet and increasing.

491
00:43:39,442 --> 00:43:41,096
Where is it? Where is it?

492
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:43,142
Where is it?!

493
00:43:51,541 --> 00:43:53,761
Oh, yes. Yes!

494
00:43:53,935 --> 00:43:55,154
You beauty.

495
00:43:59,201 --> 00:44:01,247
Okay.

496
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:11,213
Okay.

497
00:44:11,387 --> 00:44:13,781
Okay. Got to climb.

498
00:44:13,955 --> 00:44:15,740
I've got to climb.

499
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:23,911
<i>Chris.</i>

500
00:46:24,085 --> 00:46:26,305
<i>I've gone down</i>
<i>that rabbit hole again.</i>

501
00:46:28,568 --> 00:46:30,700
Got myself into a right state.

502
00:46:37,925 --> 00:46:42,930
<i>I know you say</i>
<i>that you're always safe</i>

503
00:46:43,104 --> 00:46:45,324
<i>in your tin can...</i>

504
00:46:48,066 --> 00:46:50,633
...but once you step outside...

505
00:46:54,028 --> 00:46:56,509
...it's like you're stealing
every second.

506
00:47:09,261 --> 00:47:12,917
<i>And I know it's extraordinary...</i>

507
00:47:18,052 --> 00:47:21,186
...but what we have
is extraordinary, too.

508
00:47:35,896 --> 00:47:37,811
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

509
00:47:37,985 --> 00:47:40,074
I don't know what I'm saying.

510
00:47:42,511 --> 00:47:44,731
It's just, um...

511
00:47:48,169 --> 00:47:50,128
Come home.

512
00:48:02,749 --> 00:48:04,838
<i>Please come home.</i>

513
00:48:45,661 --> 00:48:47,533
It's a body recovery now.

514
00:48:52,016 --> 00:48:53,887
No, it's not.

515
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:02,200
Stern 40%.

516
00:49:08,815 --> 00:49:09,990
Distance to dive site:

517
00:49:10,164 --> 00:49:11,731
570 feet.

518
00:49:11,905 --> 00:49:13,341
ROV, you in range?

519
00:49:13,515 --> 00:49:14,821
On the outer limit now.

520
00:49:14,995 --> 00:49:16,692
They why aren't you
finding my diver?

521
00:49:16,866 --> 00:49:18,433
Copy that.

522
00:49:31,272 --> 00:49:33,318
Come on, come on, come on.

523
00:49:34,536 --> 00:49:37,235
Incoming swell.

524
00:49:48,028 --> 00:49:50,422
Just keep her steady.

525
00:49:52,772 --> 00:49:54,600
Where are we at
with dynamic positioning?

526
00:49:54,774 --> 00:49:57,037
The only thing left
is a hard reset.

527
00:49:58,038 --> 00:49:59,822
It's only ever done
when we're in for maintenance.

528
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,824
Every part is started up
in sequence.

529
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,696
It takes hours.

530
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:06,003
Well, you'd better find a
work-around, then, hadn't you?

531
00:50:09,354 --> 00:50:11,921
Starboard, zero nine zero
degrees at 30%.

532
00:50:12,096 --> 00:50:13,967
Thirty percent.

533
00:50:22,671 --> 00:50:24,456
Closing.

534
00:50:29,548 --> 00:50:32,203
Can anyone see anything?

535
00:50:57,619 --> 00:50:59,447
Where the hell is he?

536
00:51:03,016 --> 00:51:05,105
What about up top?

537
00:51:33,568 --> 00:51:35,440
Oh, my God.

538
00:51:47,713 --> 00:51:49,584
He's still alive.

539
00:52:17,612 --> 00:52:19,484
His eyes are closed.

540
00:52:20,572 --> 00:52:23,009
All four limbs appear intact.

541
00:52:24,184 --> 00:52:26,099
No sign of breathing.

542
00:52:29,972 --> 00:52:33,324
Involuntary spasms are from...

543
00:52:33,498 --> 00:52:35,761
oxygen starvation to the brain.

544
00:52:44,248 --> 00:52:46,293
Come on, where is it?

545
00:52:50,471 --> 00:52:52,778
Got you.

546
00:52:53,779 --> 00:52:55,041
Bridge?

547
00:52:55,215 --> 00:52:56,651
I think I've found
that work-around.

548
00:52:56,825 --> 00:52:58,131
Tell me.

549
00:52:58,305 --> 00:52:59,698
Every part of the
dynamic positioning

550
00:52:59,872 --> 00:53:02,483
is routed through
a start-up CPU,

551
00:53:02,657 --> 00:53:05,138
which is why it takes
so long to boot up,

552
00:53:05,312 --> 00:53:06,835
so I'm just gonna
physically rewire it

553
00:53:07,009 --> 00:53:08,576
and bypass the whole damn thing.

554
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:11,449
Are you sure you can
patch it back correctly?

555
00:53:11,623 --> 00:53:14,408
You'll have to get
the sequencing exactly right.

556
00:53:15,409 --> 00:53:16,889
I can do it.

557
00:53:17,063 --> 00:53:20,153
DPO, go ahead. Do it.

558
00:53:29,467 --> 00:53:31,599
Why don't you use
the ROV to pick up Chris

559
00:53:31,773 --> 00:53:33,949
and fly him back to the bell?

560
00:53:34,123 --> 00:53:36,038
It's rated to pick up humans.

561
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:39,041
You can grab
the D ring on his harness

562
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:41,087
with the pincers from the ROV.

563
00:53:41,261 --> 00:53:44,656
Uh, the ROVs are only ever used
for body recoveries.

564
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:47,006
Okay? The pincers
are far too dangerous

565
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:49,530
to be used on anything alive.

566
00:53:49,704 --> 00:53:52,707
I can't see any other options.

567
00:53:52,881 --> 00:53:54,231
Can you?

568
00:53:56,972 --> 00:54:00,149
Look, Chris is alive right now,
okay, and...

569
00:54:00,324 --> 00:54:02,674
and I don't want
anything I do to change that.

570
00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:08,027
But these lads
are my responsibility.

571
00:54:10,769 --> 00:54:12,901
I'm going to take the controls.

572
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,852
Shit.

573
00:55:34,853 --> 00:55:36,985
Okay, okay.
Ease up on the front propellers

574
00:55:37,159 --> 00:55:40,032
and let the rears do
all the work, okay?

575
00:55:40,206 --> 00:55:41,512
Copy.

576
00:56:52,713 --> 00:56:54,193
Got him.

577
00:56:54,367 --> 00:56:56,456
Okay, good.

578
00:56:58,632 --> 00:57:00,460
Raising level now.

579
00:57:08,686 --> 00:57:09,861
Come on.

580
00:57:23,918 --> 00:57:26,051
He-he must be caught
on something.

581
00:57:26,225 --> 00:57:28,445
Hey, check the bottom camera.

582
00:57:36,278 --> 00:57:38,933
Why the hell is that carabiner
clipped on?

583
00:57:41,022 --> 00:57:42,676
So he won't get washed away
by the tide

584
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:44,548
when he's unconscious.

585
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:47,812
Smart lad.

586
00:57:56,690 --> 00:57:58,997
Setting her down facing Chris.

587
00:58:48,786 --> 00:58:50,222
<i>Chris and I first met</i>

588
00:58:50,396 --> 00:58:52,441
<i>on a rescue dive op.</i>

589
00:58:55,314 --> 00:58:58,535
<i>A lobster boat went down</i>
<i>off the Scottish coast.</i>

590
00:59:07,674 --> 00:59:11,417
<i>Took us a day to find the wreck.</i>

591
00:59:11,591 --> 00:59:14,725
<i>And taking turns,</i>
<i>we were down there for hours.</i>

592
00:59:16,117 --> 00:59:17,902
<i>Hours.</i>

593
00:59:38,313 --> 00:59:41,055
<i>We couldn't find the last body.</i>

594
00:59:43,405 --> 00:59:46,539
<i>Guess the current</i>
<i>must have carried it away.</i>

595
00:59:50,935 --> 00:59:52,893
<i>Eventually, it was decided that</i>

596
00:59:53,067 --> 00:59:55,461
it wasn't worth the money
to continue looking

597
00:59:55,635 --> 00:59:57,985
for just a body.

598
00:59:58,159 --> 01:00:02,207
So they gave his wife
a shoebox...

599
01:00:04,339 --> 01:00:07,516
...full of stuff they'd
cleaned out from his locker.

600
01:00:08,866 --> 01:00:10,432
Imagine...

601
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:15,220
a box of useless shit,
souvenirs.

602
01:00:18,571 --> 01:00:23,663
I'm not giving Morag a shoebox.

603
01:00:27,232 --> 01:00:29,016
You won't.

604
01:00:30,583 --> 01:00:33,107
We're not gonna give up on him.

605
01:00:34,674 --> 01:00:36,371
Good.

606
01:00:50,734 --> 01:00:52,692
Five, six, seven, eight.

607
01:01:02,267 --> 01:01:04,835
One eleven, two eleven,

608
01:01:05,009 --> 01:01:07,925
three eleven, four eleven,
five eleven.

609
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,329
Oh, no, no.

610
01:01:31,862 --> 01:01:34,342
Yes!

611
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:46,746
The DPS is back online.

612
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:48,313
Well done.

613
01:01:48,487 --> 01:01:50,576
Take us back to the manifold.

614
01:01:51,664 --> 01:01:52,970
Yes, Cap.

615
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:56,756
Locked on and engaged.

616
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:58,889
Let's go get Chris.

617
01:01:59,063 --> 01:02:00,673
Auto selected.

618
01:02:09,334 --> 01:02:10,552
Oh.

619
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,729
Oh, finally.

620
01:02:12,903 --> 01:02:13,860
Bell, you copy?

621
01:02:14,034 --> 01:02:15,383
Yeah, yeah.

622
01:02:15,557 --> 01:02:17,124
We copy, Dive Control.

623
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:20,562
How you guys doing?

624
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:23,217
We're fine. What about Chris?

625
01:02:23,391 --> 01:02:25,742
We found him.
He's on top of the manifold.

626
01:02:27,831 --> 01:02:31,095
He's unresponsive, but we are
heading back as fast as we can.

627
01:02:32,096 --> 01:02:33,662
Okay, speed up.

628
01:02:33,837 --> 01:02:35,621
160 feet to manifold.

629
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:49,504
- Gas is good.
-Hey.

630
01:02:49,678 --> 01:02:52,551
I'm not losing two divers today.

631
01:02:56,163 --> 01:02:57,861
Copy that.

632
01:02:58,949 --> 01:03:00,167
You're good to go.

633
01:03:11,135 --> 01:03:14,312
That's diver one in
the water, ready and waiting.

634
01:03:14,486 --> 01:03:16,444
Coming over dive site.

635
01:03:20,971 --> 01:03:23,103
Got eyes on Chris.

636
01:03:24,104 --> 01:03:25,323
Get me closer.

637
01:03:29,457 --> 01:03:30,807
Cap, we got to push
our minimums.

638
01:03:30,981 --> 01:03:32,634
We need to get Dave lower.

639
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:34,071
Do it.

640
01:03:35,072 --> 01:03:36,595
Reducing to 20 feet.

641
01:03:41,643 --> 01:03:43,167
Settling. Settling.

642
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:49,782
Locked on, Cap.

643
01:03:49,956 --> 01:03:52,002
Diver one is clear to go.

644
01:04:34,261 --> 01:04:36,046
I got him.

645
01:04:38,048 --> 01:04:40,180
Bell, I'm climbing back
to you now.

646
01:04:53,541 --> 01:04:55,413
He's heavy.

647
01:05:08,643 --> 01:05:10,254
Shit, we lost minimums.

648
01:05:10,428 --> 01:05:11,908
Bell, brace for impact.

649
01:05:30,013 --> 01:05:31,275
Duncan?

650
01:05:32,885 --> 01:05:35,148
Duncan?

651
01:05:35,322 --> 01:05:38,282
I'm okay.
Wh-What about Dave and Chris?

652
01:05:51,904 --> 01:05:54,602
Duncan, are you there?

653
01:05:56,517 --> 01:05:59,390
I'm with you, buddy.
I'm with you.

654
01:06:14,492 --> 01:06:17,669
Dave, you're pushing too hard.

655
01:06:18,626 --> 01:06:20,498
Go with the swell.

656
01:06:20,672 --> 01:06:22,979
Climb when the bell's
coming down

657
01:06:23,153 --> 01:06:25,764
and hold tight
when it's going up.

658
01:06:27,026 --> 01:06:28,419
Copy.

659
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:02,931
Duncan, this isn't working.

660
01:07:05,412 --> 01:07:06,935
You can do this, buddy.

661
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:08,676
One last push.

662
01:07:39,272 --> 01:07:41,927
Here he comes.

663
01:07:44,756 --> 01:07:46,410
Coming now.

664
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:56,724
Wait for it.

665
01:07:57,812 --> 01:07:58,770
Now! Now!

666
01:07:58,944 --> 01:08:00,206
Now!

667
01:08:49,386 --> 01:08:51,605
Duncan, I'm on the stage.

668
01:08:51,779 --> 01:08:53,346
Ready for the winch.

669
01:09:36,911 --> 01:09:38,522
Chris.

670
01:09:38,696 --> 01:09:40,393
You're all right.

671
01:09:40,567 --> 01:09:41,699
You're safe.

672
01:09:41,873 --> 01:09:43,309
You're in the bell.

673
01:09:45,137 --> 01:09:47,226
Okay, you're okay, buddy.

674
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,054
You're okay.

675
01:10:06,985 --> 01:10:08,639
Oh, come on.

676
01:10:15,994 --> 01:10:17,648
Come on!

677
01:10:39,931 --> 01:10:41,715
Okay, buddy.

678
01:10:41,889 --> 01:10:43,369
You're all right.

679
01:10:43,543 --> 01:10:46,067
You're good. You're safe.
You're in the bell.

680
01:11:02,736 --> 01:11:05,261
Can you hear me, Chris?
It's Duncan.

681
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:27,283
Is he breathing?

682
01:11:28,632 --> 01:11:30,721
Yeah. He is.

683
01:11:30,895 --> 01:11:32,549
Come on, let's get you
out of there.

684
01:11:39,904 --> 01:11:40,992
Bell, this connection's spotty.

685
01:11:41,166 --> 01:11:42,950
What's Chris's status?

686
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,953
Chris is breathing.

687
01:11:51,263 --> 01:11:53,309
But unresponsive.

688
01:11:56,616 --> 01:11:57,400
Oh, no.

689
01:12:07,148 --> 01:12:09,847
Half an hour
with no oxygen to the brain.

690
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:23,382
It's Duncan. Can you hear me?

691
01:12:24,557 --> 01:12:26,298
Hey, buddy.

692
01:12:26,472 --> 01:12:27,821
Hey.

693
01:12:27,995 --> 01:12:29,910
You're back in the bell.

694
01:12:30,084 --> 01:12:31,695
You're okay.

695
01:12:36,090 --> 01:12:37,962
Come on, buddy.

696
01:12:38,136 --> 01:12:40,225
Can you hear me?

697
01:13:10,734 --> 01:13:11,996
Chris.

698
01:13:12,170 --> 01:13:13,389
It's Dave.

699
01:13:14,607 --> 01:13:15,782
We got you.

700
01:13:15,956 --> 01:13:18,742
If you can hear me,
move your eyes.

701
01:13:18,916 --> 01:13:20,657
Squeeze my hand.

702
01:13:24,269 --> 01:13:26,053
Give me something.

703
01:13:45,725 --> 01:13:47,379
We're too late.

704
01:14:22,066 --> 01:14:25,199
No matter what,
you got him back.

705
01:14:28,072 --> 01:14:29,552
We did.

706
01:14:41,694 --> 01:14:43,217
Dave.

707
01:14:45,829 --> 01:14:47,221
You okay?

708
01:14:52,923 --> 01:14:54,490
Yeah. Yeah, we're fine, Chris.

709
01:14:54,664 --> 01:14:56,187
- How are you?
-Yeah, we're okay.

710
01:15:02,193 --> 01:15:04,195
Duncan, what's going on
down there?

711
01:15:05,892 --> 01:15:10,593
Bridge, Chris is responsive
and he's talking.

712
01:15:16,033 --> 01:15:17,208
Yes!

713
01:15:49,806 --> 01:15:52,286
What's happened?

714
01:15:53,505 --> 01:15:55,855
Well...

715
01:15:56,029 --> 01:15:58,597
we made out, but I'll tell you
about that later.

716
01:16:14,134 --> 01:16:16,223
Great job, Cap'n.

717
01:16:22,099 --> 01:16:24,492
You, too. You, too.

718
01:16:33,719 --> 01:16:34,677
Let's get 'em home.

719
01:16:34,851 --> 01:16:36,548
Aye, Cap.

720
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:53,478
Gave us a wee fright there,
Duncs.

721
01:16:53,652 --> 01:16:56,046
I think I might have
actually shit myself.

722
01:16:58,178 --> 01:17:00,006
Right, soon as the hatch
is closed, let me know.

723
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:01,965
I'm bringing you up.

724
01:17:38,392 --> 01:17:40,090
Sorry to wake you.

725
01:17:40,264 --> 01:17:42,440
Oh, it's all right.
I wasn't asleep.

726
01:17:44,137 --> 01:17:45,356
Feeling all right?

727
01:17:46,487 --> 01:17:48,402
All things considered.

728
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:51,492
Right, just breathe normally.

729
01:17:57,411 --> 01:17:59,413
I screwed up, huh?

730
01:18:02,808 --> 01:18:04,680
Just bad luck, really.

731
01:18:06,072 --> 01:18:07,508
Did your job, though.

732
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:09,772
You got to the top
of the manifold.

733
01:18:10,773 --> 01:18:12,600
Just following orders.

734
01:18:17,475 --> 01:18:19,042
How long was I lost for?

735
01:18:21,131 --> 01:18:22,828
About 40 minutes.

736
01:18:25,178 --> 01:18:26,919
I should be dead.

737
01:18:32,011 --> 01:18:33,099
Yeah.

738
01:18:36,276 --> 01:18:38,496
Pulse is strong.

739
01:18:38,670 --> 01:18:40,803
You know, it's...

740
01:18:40,977 --> 01:18:42,630
it's okay, though, really.

741
01:18:42,805 --> 01:18:44,720
Yeah, I know you're okay.

742
01:18:46,156 --> 01:18:47,592
No, I mean, um...

743
01:18:47,766 --> 01:18:49,420
just, uh...

744
01:18:51,596 --> 01:18:53,380
I felt sad for Morag.

745
01:18:55,556 --> 01:18:57,689
Felt like I'd let her down.

746
01:19:01,301 --> 01:19:03,826
I promised her
it would be okay, and then...

747
01:19:04,957 --> 01:19:06,916
...then that happens.

748
01:19:10,136 --> 01:19:12,182
And I just went numb.

749
01:19:14,532 --> 01:19:16,360
It was...

750
01:19:16,534 --> 01:19:18,188
peaceful.

751
01:19:20,233 --> 01:19:22,453
Just like drifting off to sleep.

752
01:19:28,241 --> 01:19:30,156
It's really not that bad.

753
01:19:36,293 --> 01:19:39,035
Um, I'll let you rest.

754
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:46,259
Thank you.

755
01:20:41,662 --> 01:20:43,186
Morag Martin speaking.

756
01:20:44,883 --> 01:20:47,886
That was your best
headmistress voice.

757
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:49,670
Well, that wasn't a voice
I was expecting to hear

758
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:51,672
- for a few weeks, so...
- Yeah.

759
01:20:52,282 --> 01:20:54,806
Our rotation has been
cut short, so, um...

760
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:57,548
What happened?

761
01:20:57,722 --> 01:21:00,464
There was a problem
with the ship, so...

762
01:21:00,638 --> 01:21:02,640
I'll be back in Aberdeen
the day after tomorrow.

763
01:21:02,814 --> 01:21:04,685
I'll come and pick you up, then.

764
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:07,036
No, no.
No, you don't have to do that.

765
01:21:07,210 --> 01:21:09,429
I'll make my own way back.

766
01:21:09,603 --> 01:21:10,866
I love you.

767
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:13,216
I love you.

768
01:22:18,498 --> 01:22:21,719
So, even after all this,
you're still gonna miss it?

769
01:22:21,893 --> 01:22:23,503
Every damn day.

770
01:22:23,677 --> 01:22:25,157
Why don't you speak
to management about it?

771
01:22:25,331 --> 01:22:26,680
Get you back on rotation.

772
01:22:26,854 --> 01:22:28,204
Figure it out.

773
01:22:28,378 --> 01:22:30,336
Good idea. Um...

774
01:22:30,510 --> 01:22:32,382
forgot my pillow.

775
01:22:32,556 --> 01:22:34,601
- All right. Duncan.
- Hey.

776
01:22:35,689 --> 01:22:37,996
- Love you, brother.
- Love you, too, Duncs.

777
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:41,260
Yeah.

778
01:22:41,434 --> 01:22:43,088
Hey, do you need a hand
down the gangway?

779
01:22:43,262 --> 01:22:44,611
No, I'm all right.

780
01:22:47,658 --> 01:22:49,486
Take care, Duncan.

781
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:50,878
You, too.

782
01:23:38,665 --> 01:23:40,841
How you feeling, Duncs?

783
01:23:44,497 --> 01:23:47,761
I'm just not ready
for the scrap heap yet.

784
01:23:51,983 --> 01:23:53,811
You're a good man, Duncan.

785
01:24:16,964 --> 01:24:18,009
Hiya.

786
01:24:18,183 --> 01:24:19,750
Hi.

787
01:24:26,148 --> 01:24:27,192
You okay?

788
01:24:27,366 --> 01:24:29,455
Yeah, there was an accident.

789
01:24:29,629 --> 01:24:31,196
Um...

790
01:24:34,765 --> 01:24:37,072
What happened?

791
01:24:37,246 --> 01:24:40,292
A, uh... a diver got stranded
on the seabed

792
01:24:40,466 --> 01:24:42,033
and had to be rescued.

793
01:24:42,207 --> 01:24:43,426
Oh, God.

794
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,471
Are they okay?

795
01:24:48,257 --> 01:24:51,173
It was touch and go there
for a bit, but...

796
01:24:52,957 --> 01:24:54,698
...but they're okay now.

797
01:25:03,794 --> 01:25:05,622
It was you, wasn't it?

798
01:25:09,147 --> 01:25:10,453
Oh, Chris.

799
01:25:24,597 --> 01:25:26,251
Hey. Hey, come here.

800
01:25:37,915 --> 01:25:40,439

come back to you.

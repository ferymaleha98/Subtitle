00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:36,916
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN THE WORLD
SEASON 3

4
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:04,083
Five, four, three…

5
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:08,916
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN THE WORLD
SEASON 3

6
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:42,500
RIGEN RAKELNA & INDRA JEGEL
HOST

7
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:45,583
Good evening,
and welcome to the final night

8
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:48,375
of The Most Beautiful Girl in the World!

9
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,958
With me, Rigen Rakelna, and my co-host…

10
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:56,125
I’m Indra Jegel, and I will guide you
during the next four months--

11
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:57,041
That's too long.

12
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:58,208
Fine, sorry. I'm sorry.

13
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,375
Tonight, we will determine the match

14
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,541
of our Star Bachelor, Brandon Prakoso.

15
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,875
Wow.

16
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:08,541
-That’s right.
-Yes.

17
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:13,833
So, can I keep one of the girls
that Brandon doesn't choose?

18
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:16,833
If so, I want that too.

19
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:21,083
Rigen, don't forget.
You have two sick kids at home.

20
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,208
Right, I forgot. I should probably go.

21
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,916
-Please don't. We’re still working.
-My kids are sick.

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,833
Oh, right.

23
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:33,000
-Kia.
-Yes?

24
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:36,000
Leave it.
The proposal can be finished later.

25
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,625
It's almost done.

26
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,916
You're so busy. Come here!

27
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:42,541
No big deal, Ram. Don't worry.

28
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,291
-To break the ice.
-Right. Okay, stop interfering.

29
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:48,291
Thank you for attending
today’s final night, sir.

30
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:53,041
That’s right. Put your hands together
for Mr. Gunadi Wiraatmadja.

31
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,375
That's right.

32
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:58,125
And we also have the prince of WinTV.

33
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:03,625
-None other than Reuben Wiraatmadja.
-Wiraatmadja.

34
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:09,916
The audience here and at home can’t wait.

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,458
-Yes.
-Who will be chosen by Brandon?

36
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:14,958
But before that, let’s check this out.

37
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,833
Let’s check this out.

38
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:24,791
Give me my roast chicken.

39
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:25,708
We have leftovers?

40
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:31,750
-…announce the winner.
-The winner will be from…

41
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,083
She'll be announced by…

42
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,541
We'll announce it.

43
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,125
-Fine.
-Okay, change this.

44
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,458
ANGGIE SUKMA

45
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,500
Are you okay?

46
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,625
Back again at the final night

47
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,416
of The Most Beautiful Girl in the World.

48
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,875
This moment is intense, huh, Rigen?

49
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:17,958
That's right.
We’ve arrived at the end of the show.

50
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,208
We will soon find out

51
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:24,458
the match of our Star Bachelor,
Brandon Prakoso.

52
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:26,291
I think it will feel incomplete...

53
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:30,333
-Yes.
-…if we don’t invite Mr. Gunadi

54
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:34,166
because we know
he is the embodiment of a family man.

55
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,583
-Yes, maintaining harmony in his family.
-Right.

56
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,791
And as the leader of a TV station…

57
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:41,458
-Guess they didn't do their research.
-…a kind man.

58
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:44,000
Mr. Gunadi, the stage is yours.

59
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:48,916
Next up, it wouldn't be complete

60
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,958
if we don’t invite Reuben Wiraatmadja

61
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,791
-to join us on stage.
-Me? This is ridiculous.

62
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,833
Before giving a speech,

63
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:05,166
Mr. Gunadi and Reuben should congratulate
the five finalists and Brandon Prakoso.

64
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,250
Yes.

65
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,500
-…give congratulations.
-Congratulations.

66
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:12,625
Congratulations.

67
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,375
Congratulations.

68
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,583
Please, this is live.

69
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,500
Okay? Don’t make a scene.

70
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,125
What was that?

71
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,500
Whoa, she slapped him!

72
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,333
Isn't all of this an act?

73
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,708
Did you write this?

74
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:35,791
No, it wasn't me.

75
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:39,833
See? I told you, Mr. Reuben is a playboy.

76
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:43,416
-Watch your mouth.
-Don't tell lies!

77
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,833
What were you thinking, Ben?

78
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:48,000
Dad, we started dating
before she joined the show this season.

79
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,958
And she already knew she wouldn't win.

80
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,833
What does this have to do
with you dumping her tonight?

81
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:57,125
Nothing. I just wanted to break up.
And I'm not responsible for her reaction.

82
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,458
This can become
a public deception scandal.

83
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:02,625
All participants must be single.
No boyfriend.

84
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:06,291
None of the finalists are single.
All of them have boyfriends.

85
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:10,708
Their boyfriends allowed them
to date another guy for weeks.

86
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:14,708
That Brandon something. From the start,
this show was already a public deception.

87
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:19,500
After a long period of no high ratings,
this show has become our mainstay.

88
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:20,875
Let's bet on it, okay?

89
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:23,250
Tomorrow, that one scene will go viral.

90
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,291
And as you wish,

91
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,541
WinTV's rating will skyrocket.

92
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,250
You’re smart, Ben.

93
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:42,291
But you're cynical.

94
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,125
That's how you raised me, Dad.

95
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,916
My apologies, Gun, Reuben.

96
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,416
We have to return to the studio.
Time for closing.

97
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,083
I’m not needed, right?

98
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:15,500
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN THE WORLD

99
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,125
-Hey, Jimmy.
-Hey.

100
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:24,291
I've emailed the presentation material
for the meeting with Mr. Marc.

101
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:25,375
Have you seen it?

102
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,083
-Yeah. Real Shop, right?
-Yes.

103
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:28,875
I skimmed through it.

104
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:32,458
But it's crazy. You prepared it
faster than I could read it.

105
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:35,333
Did you prepare it
during that incident earlier?

106
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:39,000
What happened earlier?
I saw a slap, but I have no idea why.

107
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,625
You are so behind, Ki.

108
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,375
To focus on more important things.

109
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,000
That’s true.

110
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,083
But this is good.
I think you can present it.

111
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,000
Seriously?

112
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,541
I only skimmed it, but it's good.
Just needs polishing.

113
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:52,708
-Okay.
-Good job.

114
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,500
-Thank you.
-No problem.

115
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,583
-Morning, Mr. Reuben.
-Morning, Ivan.

116
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,083
Morning.

117
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:14,750
-Morning, sir.
-Morning.

118
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:17,416
Good morning.

119
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,625
Morning, sir.

120
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,125
-Morning, sir.
-Morning.

121
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:50,250
Is Mr. Agung here as your best friend,
or do you need spiritual advice?

122
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,333
Reuben, please don’t start.

123
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,750
It’s okay, Gun. I’ll leave now.

124
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,333
Ben,

125
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:07,583
you can be cynical with me,
but not with Mr. Agung.

126
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:08,875
Isn’t that the truth?

127
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,125
His official position here
is as your spiritual advisor.

128
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:13,541
Am I wrong?

129
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:18,041
Anyway, damage control is done.

130
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,916
I've also taken the time to see Anggie,

131
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:23,500
so people will believe
it was just a misunderstanding.

132
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,416
Luckily, I didn’t get slapped again.

133
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,833
It's good, for now.

134
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:30,458
Right.

135
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:36,708
I also want to tell you
to stop handling TSP Bank's variety show.

136
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,791
But why? Branded content is my thing.

137
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,791
Real Shop is fine. You can finish that.

138
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,583
But that’s the last one.

139
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:47,750
Until I've decided
what you’ll be handling next.

140
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,166
Well, that’s bullshit.

141
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:53,208
Branded content is the only show
where I don’t have to worry about ratings.

142
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,375
Unlike the other divisions
who worship ratings. Like you.

143
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,875
You need to learn responsibility.

144
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,083
What responsibility?
Real Shop is going well.

145
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,750
The revenue is excellent.
The performance is great.

146
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,416
-There's no problem.
-Hey. Listen!

147
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:10,208
I've never taught you to date girls
and then dump them just like that.

148
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:13,875
You were also dating other girls
while being involved with Anggie.

149
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,625
-You're talking nonsense.
-No, I'm not.

150
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:19,250
Your behavior
almost caused a scandal for us.

151
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,750
The ratings decreased because of soccer.

152
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:22,958
Reuben, please.

153
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:28,583
Your behavior towards girls
is disrespectful.

154
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,208
Wow.

155
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,541
Disrespectful?

156
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:41,708
This is coming from the creator
of The Most Beautiful Girl in the World,

157
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,875
where all the girls
are fighting over a guy.

158
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,125
Don't talk to me about respect.

159
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,583
Maybe it's time for you to settle down.

160
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:53,291
Okay?

161
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,750
Get married.

162
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,041
Settle down? Get married?

163
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,208
Why do we have to commit
to just one woman?

164
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,083
So they can leave, like how Mom left you?

165
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,000
This meeting is over.

166
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:32,083
So, that’s the overview
of the reality show

167
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,791
that we will propose
for launching on WinTV

168
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,750
to increase user experience in Real Shop.

169
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:41,583
In our opinion, sir,
inviting Korean stars isn’t effective.

170
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:45,666
The audience will remember the stars,
but there's no benefit for Real Shop,

171
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,250
other than repeating their names
during the program.

172
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:52,000
Yes, but the name of the main sponsor
will be top of mind of the audience.

173
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,083
Yes, I agree, sir.

174
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:58,500
But it’ll be better if we can highlight
Real Shop's strong points.

175
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:02,041
Namely, providing overseas goods
that can't be done by other e-commerce.

176
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,916
The budget to hire Korean stars

177
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,583
can be used to increase user experience
for people at home. Potential customers.

178
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:13,291
-First, we must--
-What if I tell you

179
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:14,791
that budget is not an issue?

180
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:18,666
We are aware that budget
is not an issue for Real Shop, but--

181
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,750
Truth be told, your idea is good.

182
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:24,291
A user experience
that involves the audience.

183
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:27,625
We can elaborate on that
during on-site executions.

184
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,083
But for this one,

185
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,625
I think K-pop stars will sell more.

186
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:39,041
-Hi, sir. Sorry for interrupting.
-Hey, Reuben.

187
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,958
-How are you? Good?
-I'm good. And you?

188
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,583
I’m good. Just wanted to say hi.

189
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:44,500
Well? All good?

190
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:45,916
-All good.
-Not really.

191
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:51,041
Your subordinate
was just picking my idea apart.

192
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,583
We got a little feedback from Kiara, sir.

193
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,041
Hey! No worries.

194
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,000
The owner doesn't have to intervene.

195
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,958
Besides, this is a usual annual program.

196
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,625
If there’s a problem,
I usually handle it right away.

197
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,708
Okay, please continue the meeting.

198
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,458
Jim, please come to my office after this.

199
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,500
Okay, sir.

200
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:14,666
Sir, please continue.

201
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,791
-Yes. Thank you, Ben.
-Yeah, good to see you.

202
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:21,833
What's up, boss?

203
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,416
I'm not in a good mood.

204
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,291
Not to mention…
Who was she? That girl next to you?

205
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,000
-Kiara.
-Yeah, that one.

206
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,625
She's an assistant producer after all.
Don't mind her.

207
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,958
Obsessed with being a producer.
But she's fast.

208
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,500
I don’t care if she works fast.

209
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:38,041
You know what she did?
She showed dislike towards me.

210
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:41,125
I was talking. When I glanced,
she was rolling her eyes like this.

211
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:44,500
Just let it go.
So what if a girl doesn't like you?

212
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:47,458
Your life is too plain.
A little complexity is good.

213
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:50,250
The complexity
between me and my dad is enough.

214
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,458
I don’t want any more of that.
Don't need it.

215
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:53,416
Good point.

216
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,166
No need. I've had coffee.

217
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,208
I'll have one, then.

218
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,041
Is her face really that bitchy?

219
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,416
That’s how she is. What can we do?

220
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,875
Her life must be hard, huh?

221
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:17,625
Are you done yet?

222
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,000
You're vomiting too much.

223
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,875
Stop it, okay? That's enough.

224
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:29,625
Oh, my.

225
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:35,125
Your stress management
has sucked ever since high school.

226
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,333
You throw up so easily.

227
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,375
A little problem or stress, and you vomit.

228
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:41,666
At least
my stress isn't harming anyone, Dit.

229
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:45,125
Isn't it harmful
when you throw up on someone?

230
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,291
-That's nasty.
-You're the nasty one!

231
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:49,750
You’re the one who threw up.

232
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,375
You mentioned vomiting on someone.

233
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:56,791
Enough already. Maybe it’s time
to find a new job. A different one.

234
00:14:57,416 --> 00:15:00,333
Like what? I like the broadcasting world.
What can I do?

235
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:03,791
Maybe the broadcasting world
doesn’t like you. Then what?

236
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:08,083
Just let it be.
At least until I become a producer.

237
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,250
So I can fulfill my dreams.

238
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:15,333
I get it.
This is about your dream apartment, right?

239
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,916
Yes, my dream that you said is too high.

240
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,083
We're still going to live together, right?

241
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,208
Huh? What do you mean?

242
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,000
You said you wanted to live with me.

243
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,500
-One room for me.
-What is this? Never heard of it.

244
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,166
-Whatever. I’m leaving.
-Hey.

245
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,208
- You forgot your tumbler! Here!
- Oh, yeah.

246
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,000
Hey, Gun.

247
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:01,875
How long is Reuben going to be suspended
from branded content?

248
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:05,791
Reuben is tactical.
He’ll make an excellent leader.

249
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,458
Sometimes, his legal advice
is even more proper than mine.

250
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:11,458
The mitigation of Anggie's incident
proved that.

251
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,208
He’s really good.

252
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,500
That's true, but he dislikes ratings.

253
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,041
And he hates programs
that he considers have no class.

254
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,125
Is that wrong?
You were the same back then.

255
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,500
That was the past.

256
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:27,125
He’s definitely talented.
And he's got the skills.

257
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:31,708
-Unfortunately, he's still a mess.
-And you're not a mess right now?

258
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,166
Ten million!

259
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,958
-Are you serious?
-Yes!

260
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,250
Your cards must be good.

261
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:49,291
I’ll fold.

262
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:54,000
Okay. In that case, I’ll see your ten.
And add another ten million.

263
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,041
I'm in. Ten million.

264
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,041
Full house.

265
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,250
Are you serious?

266
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,666
Hey, hold that thought.

267
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,125
-Want to count my money?
-No.

268
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,458
Because I have a straight flush!

269
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:08,791
Wow, Bas.

270
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:11,416
Right?

271
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,541
How many times
did I get tricked by you, Gun?

272
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,833
That’s why you shouldn't rush things.

273
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:17,666
Take it slow.

274
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,583
Gosh, this man is crazy.

275
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,166
-Gun?
-What is it, Gun?

276
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,125
-Gun!
-What's wrong, Gun? Gun!

277
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,250
-Gun!
-Gun? What is it?

278
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,875
-Bas, come here!
-Gun?

279
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:39,958
I was thinking, it'll be so much fun
if you do an adventure program.

280
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,541
I want it so badly!

281
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,916
But I don't think
I can last for two weeks.

282
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,541
I'll miss you.

283
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:51,625
I mean, if you like traveling or…

284
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,541
-Sorry, just a minute.
-Sure.

285
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,125
-Hold on.
-Take your time.

286
00:18:58,375 --> 00:18:59,750
Yes? What is it, sir?

287
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:00,750
Reuben.

288
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:02,541
Your dad

289
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,250
passed away.

290
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:19,458
IS THIS ANNA SAVITRI?
MOM, IT'S ME, REUBEN.

291
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,416
MOM, I NEED YOUR HELP.

292
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,791
A FEW WEEKS LATER

293
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,041
Good afternoon.

294
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:56,958
As Mr. Gunadi Wiraatmadja’s attorney,
I will read the contents of his will.

295
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:01,583
"To my son, Reuben Wiraatmadja,

296
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:05,875
the entirety of my wealth,
whether in the form of money or assets,

297
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:11,583
will be his if he gets married
to the most beautiful girl in the world

298
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:14,000
in the next six months.

299
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,500
And the one who will decide

300
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:20,916
whether his future wife
fulfills the criteria

301
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,875
of the most beautiful girl in the world

302
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:29,916
is a committee
that will be established by my best friend

303
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,625
and spiritual advisor, Agung Santoso.

304
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:36,250
Thus I conclude my will,

305
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:41,458
which I wrote consciously,
without any coercion from any parties,

306
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:45,875
so that it could be exercised properly."

307
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,625
I don’t understand.

308
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:53,541
Your dad
must have his reasons for this, Ben.

309
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:02,000
Here’s the thing.
I have very big dreams for WinTV.

310
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:04,666
Do you know, Mr. Agung?

311
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:07,083
I want to reform WinTV.

312
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:12,000
Now that dream could disappear

313
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:17,416
and it might be hard to achieve it
if I can’t fulfill these requirements.

314
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,250
This doesn’t make sense.

315
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,500
In this room,

316
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,958
the one
who understands your father the most

317
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:26,958
should be you, Reuben.

318
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:37,041
This might be an opportunity for me.

319
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:39,791
-What do you mean?
-Well…

320
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:43,291
An opportunity to create classy shows.

321
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:46,375
I’ll even make The Most Beautiful Girl
in the World classy.

322
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:48,750
You want to handle that show?

323
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:50,208
I'll be the Star Bachelor.

324
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:51,958
Huh? What?

325
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:54,375
Well, yeah. Hear me out.

326
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:58,500
I'm basically killing two birds
with one stone.

327
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:03,750
Okay? First,
I can fulfill my dad’s requirements.

328
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:06,791
Mr. Agung is involved in this, right?
He’s the gatekeeper.

329
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:08,416
And he's the decision maker.

330
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,375
Hold up.
Can't you just look for a real wife?

331
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:15,000
Then introduce her to Mr. Agung,
like a normal person would do.

332
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:16,333
There’s a second reason.

333
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:19,000
I can make a genuinely classy show.

334
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:21,625
At least this could be
my leverage for Mr. Agung.

335
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:26,291
That way, he'll consider me worthy
of WinTV's legacy.

336
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:30,000
We'll use the same title?
The Most Beautiful Girl in the World?

337
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:32,791
No need to change it.
That’s what my dad wanted.

338
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,000
And the logo?

339
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:36,458
-Same thing. He designed it.
-Look, boss.

340
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:40,708
This whole reality show,
The Most Beautiful Girl in the World,

341
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:44,416
it's all staged. You still have to find
a woman to be the winner.

342
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,583
You don’t understand.

343
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:50,208
I want to make a real show.
Nothing will be staged.

344
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:53,958
From registration of participants,
moving up to the next level,

345
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:56,750
all the way to the finals,
nothing will be staged. All real.

346
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:00,333
And finally, I myself
will choose the winner. It's good, right?

347
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:05,333
I don’t get it, bro.

348
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,208
So, you want to be the Star Bachelor

349
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:15,083
and you want to look for a wife
through that show? Is that right?

350
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:16,458
Yes, that’s right.

351
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:20,125
You can take care
of establishing a committee, or whatever.

352
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,708
Watch the show yourself,
then decide based on that.

353
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:24,625
And you said nothing will be staged?

354
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:26,666
Yup.

355
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,791
Here’s the thing.

356
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:31,583
Do you know
why that program needs staging?

357
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:34,291
Because we have to get the ratings.

358
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:36,708
And how do we get that?

359
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:38,333
From the drama.

360
00:24:38,416 --> 00:24:41,416
That’s why we need to prepare all of that.

361
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:45,291
I want to make a good show.

362
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:48,041
As organic as possible.
And the ratings will follow.

363
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:49,125
All right, then.

364
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:54,375
-Then we will need a producer.
-Uh-huh.

365
00:24:54,458 --> 00:24:56,750
Jimmy, how about you?

366
00:24:57,541 --> 00:25:00,750
I'm already handling
a lot of live shows, sir.

367
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,791
So, maybe… Ki?

368
00:25:06,666 --> 00:25:08,291
-Sorry, sir. This room--
-Kiara!

369
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:12,708
-Excuse me.
-Your name is Kiara?

370
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:16,916
Uh… Yes, sir.

371
00:25:19,416 --> 00:25:21,708
Okay. Just a minute, sir.

372
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:23,541
Outside.

373
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:04,083
If I were a regular person,
I wouldn't participate in this show.

374
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:06,083
That's why I refuse to handle this, sir.

375
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:08,208
As a woman and a layman,

376
00:26:08,291 --> 00:26:10,125
I consider that show very misogynistic.

377
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,375
Hmm.

378
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:18,541
This is good. She has the guts
to speak up in the office.

379
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:20,458
That’s great. It's good.

380
00:26:20,541 --> 00:26:25,166
I get what you mean,
and we'll do this the opposite way.

381
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:29,000
This show will not be condescending
towards women whatsoever.

382
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:32,750
A little on-site information, sir.
I'm afraid you might not know.

383
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:35,416
Miss Galuh resigned
because of the same reason.

384
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:39,291
She was just being professional
by finishing Season 3.

385
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:40,375
Good luck to her.

386
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:43,291
There are lots of similar TV shows
out there.

387
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:46,625
But for this Season 4,
you'll increase the cringeworthy aspect

388
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:49,708
by making yourself,
the owner of the company--

389
00:26:49,791 --> 00:26:52,458
-Future owner.
-Okay. As the future owner--

390
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:53,375
Owner!

391
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:56,416
Okay, whatever.

392
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,166
Not "whatever." It's "owner."

393
00:27:00,666 --> 00:27:04,375
Sir, as the owner,
you will be the center of attention.

394
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:07,333
And the prize.
Sorry to say, that's a little tacky.

395
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:15,250
Well, your job is to make this show
neither tacky nor misogynistic.

396
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,791
You probably need eye drops
if there's something in your eyes.

397
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:25,833
Maybe your eyes are suffering
from a mini stroke, or whatever.

398
00:27:25,916 --> 00:27:27,541
Try covering them with sunglasses.

399
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,333
-They're fine, sir.
-Okay.

400
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:37,333
I heard that you're very ambitious
and you're aiming to be a producer.

401
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:38,583
You want freedom.

402
00:27:38,666 --> 00:27:41,291
And even Miss Galuh
never got this type of freedom.

403
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:43,125
Let me ask you this.

404
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:46,375
If an opportunity like this comes along,

405
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,666
do you think
it comes anytime and from anywhere?

406
00:27:54,291 --> 00:27:56,791
Just think of it as a challenge.

407
00:27:58,333 --> 00:27:59,708
Just create a good program.

408
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:01,916
Let me handle the rest.

409
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,666
Okay?

410
00:28:11,583 --> 00:28:12,416
Well, damn.

411
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,250
Let's make a bet.

412
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:17,458
A lot of women will definitely sign up.

413
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:21,583
I mean, who doesn’t want to be
with Reuben Wiraatmadja?

414
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:24,583
-Me!
-Can you hear me out first?

415
00:28:24,666 --> 00:28:26,166
Okay, fine. Sorry.

416
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:29,083
He is rich. Extremely wealthy.

417
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:31,458
Handsome? No need to question that.

418
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:32,375
Not to mention,

419
00:28:32,458 --> 00:28:36,875
the winner will receive the title
of The Most Beautiful Girl in the World.

420
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,625
-Isn't that the definition of happiness?
-Ouch!

421
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:41,833
Your happiness
will last until the afterlife.

422
00:28:41,916 --> 00:28:44,500
You're insane. The only odd one. Weirdo.

423
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:47,125
Can you imagine yourself
joining this competition?

424
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:48,583
It's stressful.

425
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:52,125
And the prize
is marrying a man like him? God forbid.

426
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:54,833
Yeah, you're right. God forbid, right?

427
00:28:54,916 --> 00:28:57,208
-God forbid he's so handsome!
-Hey!

428
00:28:57,291 --> 00:28:59,458
Don’t judge a book by its cover, dear.

429
00:28:59,541 --> 00:29:01,375
I do judge a book by its cover, dear.

430
00:29:01,458 --> 00:29:03,541
Don't forget, I’m a book graphic designer.

431
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:05,500
Right, damn it. I used the wrong idiom.

432
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:08,208
- Hey! The tissues are there!
- Okay, fine.

433
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,958
-Want a drink?
-Yes, please.

434
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:17,750
Just take it.

435
00:29:18,708 --> 00:29:20,041
You said it yourself,

436
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,875
you‘ve been aiming
to be a producer for a long time.

437
00:29:22,958 --> 00:29:25,750
And now the opportunity
is in front of you, you won't take it.

438
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:28,416
Well, yeah, I do want to be a producer.
But the thing is,

439
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,083
I still want to maintain my sanity.

440
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:32,750
Imagine this.

441
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:35,166
I manage to buy that apartment,
but I become insane.

442
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,333
What's the use?

443
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:39,541
I get it. Work-life balance.

444
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:44,875
Well, if you want to fulfill your dreams
of buying an apartment,

445
00:29:44,958 --> 00:29:47,916
then you’ll probably have to try
online gambling or online loans.

446
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,208
Right? Both options will still carry

447
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:53,916
the risk of you losing your apartment.

448
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,875
Don't you have a better alternative?

449
00:29:55,958 --> 00:29:57,250
I mean--

450
00:29:57,916 --> 00:30:00,500
-You’re not supportive at all!
-Because you're so stubborn!

451
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:03,625
You're ignoring this opportunity
right in front of you. Weirdo!

452
00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:05,958
Forget it! I’m going home.
Eat this martabak.

453
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:08,750
-You won't take some? Just a piece or two.
-No, I'm full.

454
00:30:08,833 --> 00:30:10,083
-Hold on.
-What is it?

455
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:11,916
So hardheaded!

456
00:30:12,541 --> 00:30:13,750
Go home!

457
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:15,500
-Bye!
-Bye!

458
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,166
First, let’s think about the storytelling.

459
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:32,583
I already prepared that.

460
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:36,875
Are you serious, Mr. Reuben?
You’ll be the Star Bachelor?

461
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:39,166
It's not a desperate attempt
for ratings, right?

462
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,791
The objective is to find a wife,

463
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:44,333
but after three seasons,
none of the winners have gotten married.

464
00:30:44,416 --> 00:30:45,833
Thank you for the questions.

465
00:30:45,916 --> 00:30:48,125
First of all,
yes, I am looking for a wife.

466
00:30:48,208 --> 00:30:54,458
And I’m doing this
to fulfill my late father's last wish.

467
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:58,750
Unfortunately,
I haven’t had the chance to…

468
00:30:58,833 --> 00:31:00,375
His acting is pretty good.

469
00:31:02,583 --> 00:31:04,625
I urged him to try soap operas.
He refused.

470
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,541
Secondly, we'll flip the narrative.

471
00:31:09,625 --> 00:31:14,625
This isn't about women competing
to win over Reuben Wiraatmadja’s heart.

472
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:17,416
-Instead…
-This is my personal effort

473
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,666
as Reuben Wiraatmadja to find a soulmate.

474
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:23,833
A lot of people say that shows like these
use women as commodities.

475
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:26,541
First of all,
this is not a beauty contest.

476
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:29,416
Assessment will be based
purely on intelligence,

477
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,250
personality, and compatibility.

478
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:33,291
And any woman can sign up.

479
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:38,000
If the things I offer are suitable
with their aspirations in life,

480
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:40,458
then that’s good.
If not, I will respect that.

481
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:42,375
He could be a politician.

482
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:44,416
To end this, I'd like to reaffirm

483
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,500
that I myself will choose the contestants

484
00:31:48,583 --> 00:31:50,583
and eventually determine the winner.

485
00:31:50,666 --> 00:31:53,000
Thank you, guys. Have a good day.

486
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,000
Already 3,000?

487
00:32:00,666 --> 00:32:02,791
-How's it going, Ki?
-Oh, well…

488
00:32:02,875 --> 00:32:07,000
I was just checking
the registration for this season.

489
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:10,250
We're already up to 3,000 people
on day one. That's a lot, sir.

490
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:13,458
Maybe because we're opening to the public?
Previously, we hired them.

491
00:32:13,541 --> 00:32:17,541
I told you, if we open it to the public,
many people will sign up.

492
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:19,125
But are you

493
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:22,125
-happy with this?
-It's nothing special.

494
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:28,041
STAGE REFERENCE

495
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,541
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN THE WORLD
SPECIAL SEASON

496
00:32:36,625 --> 00:32:38,250
I don’t have any qualities.

497
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:40,666
But who knows? Maybe I'll get lucky.

498
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,750
Don’t ask about my age.

499
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:44,750
The most important thing is my experience

500
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:46,958
that I can teach Reuben.

501
00:32:53,166 --> 00:32:56,583
Is this what you meant
when you said you won't humiliate women?

502
00:32:56,666 --> 00:33:00,291
We're basically inviting the audience
to laugh at the participants.

503
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:03,708
We can’t control the women who signed up.

504
00:33:04,291 --> 00:33:07,833
That’s the risk of creating
an organic and unstaged TV show, right?

505
00:33:07,916 --> 00:33:10,750
If that’s what you think,
then you're the one humiliating them.

506
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:12,416
-I’m humiliating them?
-Yes.

507
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,958
This audition isn't over yet.

508
00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:15,958
Got it? That's the first point.

509
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:18,333
When I said I'm searching
for more qualified women,

510
00:33:18,416 --> 00:33:19,916
-it doesn't--
-No qualified women

511
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,708
will want to participate
in a show like this.

512
00:33:24,958 --> 00:33:26,958
So, you’re saying they're all stupid?

513
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:43,541
Or maybe…

514
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:45,541
Why don’t we use the old strategy, Ben?

515
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:48,333
We'll set it up, choose them, then pay.

516
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:51,875
Sorry. Just a thought.

517
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,083
We can’t control who signs up, right?

518
00:33:58,166 --> 00:33:59,125
-Mm-hmm.
-Right.

519
00:33:59,708 --> 00:34:01,791
But we can control
the audience's reaction.

520
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,708
We can choose who will be shown,

521
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:08,625
how we edit it,
so hopefully, their reaction will be--

522
00:34:08,708 --> 00:34:11,375
-Different from your reaction?
-Positive, sir.

523
00:34:11,458 --> 00:34:14,250
Do you always have to have the last word?

524
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:17,458
If you want to have the last word,
then go ahead, sir.

525
00:34:18,583 --> 00:34:19,416
Okay.

526
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:21,375
Okay.

527
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:23,958
-Okay.
-Okay.

528
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:27,333
You said I'll have the last word.

529
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,791
Oh, your last word is "okay"?

530
00:34:29,875 --> 00:34:31,666
I didn’t realize. You didn't tell me.

531
00:34:33,583 --> 00:34:34,416
Okay.

532
00:34:34,916 --> 00:34:35,750
Okay.

533
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,875
I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING OUT OF LINE, SIR.

534
00:35:04,958 --> 00:35:09,458
SO, WHAT IS YOUR VERSION
OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN THE WORLD?

535
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:11,666
JIMMY TOLD YOU TO APOLOGIZE, DIDN'T HE?

536
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:14,625
YES, SIR.

537
00:35:23,791 --> 00:35:27,875
PLEASE ANSWER THE QUESTION, SIR.

538
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:32,000
UNLESS YOU ALSO DON’T KNOW THE CRITERIA?

539
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:48,041
Well… How should I say this?

540
00:35:48,875 --> 00:35:51,625
Intelligent women
tend to have more dignity.

541
00:35:52,958 --> 00:35:54,583
You talking about yourself?

542
00:35:58,041 --> 00:36:00,000
I think we have to align

543
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:03,916
your perception of The Most Beautiful Girl
in the World with Mr. Gunadi’s.

544
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,166
Have you two ever talked about this?

545
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:08,708
-We never discussed this.
-Okay.

546
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:14,541
Or maybe your mother
talked to you about this?

547
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:15,583
Anything at all?

548
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:17,625
I have a meeting.

549
00:37:05,208 --> 00:37:12,166
CHECK TAPE
CLOCK BATTERY

550
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:15,291
-What are you doing?
-Preparing your breakfast, of course.

551
00:37:15,375 --> 00:37:16,708
Gosh, such an ideal wife.

552
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:19,250
Why do you have to record this?
Cut it out.

553
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:20,291
Need any help?

554
00:37:20,375 --> 00:37:22,500
Gun, please stop.

555
00:37:25,416 --> 00:37:26,250
Reuben!

556
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:31,416
Come here.

557
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
What are you doing?

558
00:37:37,166 --> 00:37:39,166
Hey! Cut it out!

559
00:37:40,583 --> 00:37:43,291
Gun, keep him company for a while.

560
00:37:58,083 --> 00:37:59,833
What are you recording?

561
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:02,458
You should record the view.

562
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:04,541
You're more beautiful.

563
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,083
Why are you still recording? Stop it.

564
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:17,791
My turn.

565
00:38:17,875 --> 00:38:19,708
Hey! Don't do that.

566
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,083
-Stop it. Give it here.
-Smile!

567
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:25,541
Let me take the video.

568
00:39:07,208 --> 00:39:10,041
HEADLINES
REUBEN WIRAATMADJA

569
00:39:26,041 --> 00:39:27,791
WE ALL MOVE FORWARD WHEN WE RECOGNIZE

570
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:30,583
HOW RESILIENT AND STRIKING
THE WOMEN AROUND US ARE

571
00:39:41,375 --> 00:39:42,333
Boss!

572
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:44,208
-What’s wrong?
-Nothing.

573
00:39:44,291 --> 00:39:46,666
-We're still eating outside?
-Sure, let’s go!

574
00:39:53,583 --> 00:39:54,916
As we predicted,

575
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,541
women who are capable, smart,
and especially beautiful,

576
00:39:57,625 --> 00:39:59,625
I have to emphasize on this
once more, sir.

577
00:39:59,708 --> 00:40:02,083
They are indeed too proud
to participate in our show.

578
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:04,875
That’s the reality
we must face for this special season.

579
00:40:04,958 --> 00:40:07,208
Because we want everything
to be real and organic.

580
00:40:07,291 --> 00:40:08,666
-No staging, right?
-Mm-hmm.

581
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,291
What we have to do now

582
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:14,541
is create a new perception
about Reuben Wiraatmadja.

583
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:17,291
What’s the old perception
of Reuben Wiraatmadja?

584
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:19,500
Well…

585
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:21,833
-It's like that.
-Like what?

586
00:40:21,916 --> 00:40:24,750
Anyway, my idea is a talk show.

587
00:40:24,833 --> 00:40:26,791
-Talk show?
-Yes.

588
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:29,833
Our class A talk show during prime time.

589
00:40:30,458 --> 00:40:32,291
Jimmy, can we do the talk show tomorrow?

590
00:40:32,375 --> 00:40:34,541
Sure! It’s all good, boss.

591
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:36,750
-Okay.
-Why do I feel like your assistant?

592
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:39,750
I'm so sorry.

593
00:40:39,833 --> 00:40:41,958
I swear it's not intentional.
I didn’t mean it.

594
00:40:42,041 --> 00:40:43,833
But can you check tomorrow's schedule?

595
00:40:43,916 --> 00:40:45,583
-Don't worry about it.
-Okay.

596
00:40:45,666 --> 00:40:47,208
Please check tomorrow's schedule.

597
00:40:47,291 --> 00:40:50,000
I'm also going to check
the schedule for this.

598
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:53,833
Thank you for staying with Chat with Cath.

599
00:40:53,916 --> 00:40:57,916
We still have Reuben Wiraatmadja with us.

600
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,583
Okay, Reuben,
I just want to confirm this again.

601
00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:06,208
All these controversies
surrounding this special season

602
00:41:06,291 --> 00:41:07,875
are simply misunderstandings?

603
00:41:07,958 --> 00:41:11,208
Yes, of course.
It was just a misunderstanding.

604
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:13,750
I'm looking for a wife,

605
00:41:13,833 --> 00:41:20,208
and hopefully we can also love,
value, and complete each other.

606
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:24,708
I think it's important to choose someone

607
00:41:24,791 --> 00:41:27,583
who can stand by me in the future,

608
00:41:27,666 --> 00:41:33,125
able to give me advice,
and we can also exchange ideas.

609
00:41:33,208 --> 00:41:35,166
There should be
a sense of equality in that.

610
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:38,583
I'm looking for a partner who is equal,

611
00:41:38,666 --> 00:41:41,958
in the sense that we can exchange ideas

612
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,791
at the same level of thinking.

613
00:41:44,875 --> 00:41:46,958
That's what I mean by "equal."

614
00:41:47,041 --> 00:41:51,125
So, you're not merely looking
for a trophy wife, right?

615
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:53,000
No, of course not.

616
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:56,791
You want to marry
because it's your dad's wish, right?

617
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:01,958
Well, I want to make my parents happy
before it's too late.

618
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,958
As humans, our time here is short.

619
00:42:05,041 --> 00:42:08,958
And I need a large amount of money
to do all of that.

620
00:42:09,541 --> 00:42:12,375
Does this mean
that you're only interested in my wealth?

621
00:42:12,458 --> 00:42:16,333
First, it's not about what I seek.
It's about the reason behind it.

622
00:42:17,291 --> 00:42:19,500
This is for my parents. After that,

623
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:22,208
then we can talk about what we believe in.

624
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:24,083
So what do you think I believe in?

625
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:28,625
I believe that you also consider money
as merely a tool to achieve your goals.

626
00:42:29,208 --> 00:42:33,333
If that's not the case,
you would have never created this program.

627
00:42:33,416 --> 00:42:35,875
TOP TEN

628
00:42:35,958 --> 00:42:37,708
ANNOUNCEMENT DAY:
TOMORROW!

629
00:42:37,791 --> 00:42:38,625
Finally.

630
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,250
Okay, settle down.

631
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:45,708
After picking the top 10,

632
00:42:45,791 --> 00:42:48,833
we will enter
one week with Reuben Wiraatmadja.

633
00:42:48,916 --> 00:42:51,541
So, a week with Reuben Wiraatmadja means

634
00:42:51,625 --> 00:42:54,708
a camera will follow me everywhere
when I'm with them?

635
00:42:54,791 --> 00:42:56,083
-Yes. When--
-Even in a café?

636
00:42:56,166 --> 00:42:58,625
Yes, that's right.
It's basically like that.

637
00:42:58,708 --> 00:43:00,375
But I have to remind you.

638
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:01,750
No touching.

639
00:43:01,833 --> 00:43:02,708
Agreed.

640
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:05,000
We have to show
that this season is different,

641
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:06,833
and I know I chose the right producer.

642
00:43:09,541 --> 00:43:13,166
We're finally entering
one of the most important nights

643
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:18,791
of The Most Beautiful Girl in the World,
Special Season!

644
00:43:18,875 --> 00:43:21,166
The first finalist is

645
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:24,125
Aleya Sisca!

646
00:43:26,375 --> 00:43:27,208
-Hi.
-Hi.

647
00:43:27,791 --> 00:43:28,750
-How are you?
-Good.

648
00:43:28,833 --> 00:43:32,166
What will you do
if you win this competition?

649
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:36,666
If I win, I’ll make sure
that I'm worthy of this title.

650
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:41,791
Because I'm not just physically beautiful.
I'm also beautiful on the inside.

651
00:43:44,916 --> 00:43:47,750
Next, we've got Nikita Karen.

652
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:55,291
I might not be
the most beautiful girl in the world,

653
00:43:55,375 --> 00:43:57,250
but I can be anything for Reuben.

654
00:43:58,083 --> 00:44:01,625
I’ll make sure he doesn't need to look
at another women ever again.

655
00:44:01,708 --> 00:44:04,166
And next, Agatha Jessica.

656
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:06,625
If I win this contest,

657
00:44:06,708 --> 00:44:09,500
I will personally use this opportunity
to help young women

658
00:44:09,583 --> 00:44:14,333
so they won't think that special privilege
is the only means to success, Reuben.

659
00:44:15,375 --> 00:44:18,166
For the next woman,
please welcome Helen Kusuma.

660
00:44:19,166 --> 00:44:20,000
Welcome.

661
00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:23,375
This is the VIP lounge.

662
00:44:23,458 --> 00:44:26,666
Actually, anyone can come in here.

663
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:32,666
But because my dad was often here,
they're a little scared to come inside.

664
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:36,000
We do have a small kitchen.

665
00:44:36,083 --> 00:44:38,333
We can eat and drink. Yeah.

666
00:44:38,833 --> 00:44:42,541
But have you ever eaten
at the staff's cafeteria?

667
00:44:43,708 --> 00:44:45,083
The staff's cafeteria.

668
00:44:45,666 --> 00:44:48,000
-Can you turn that off for a sec?
-Okay, sir.

669
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,500
Well…

670
00:44:53,083 --> 00:44:55,125
I have, but not very often.

671
00:44:55,791 --> 00:44:56,958
Want to try it now?

672
00:44:57,541 --> 00:44:59,833
-Try what?
-The staff's cafeteria.

673
00:44:59,916 --> 00:45:01,958
Oh, sure.

674
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:06,000
But we'll be wasting the food here.

675
00:45:06,083 --> 00:45:07,458
It’s okay, I’m joking.

676
00:45:07,541 --> 00:45:08,458
Where’s Kiara?

677
00:45:08,541 --> 00:45:10,375
I don't know, sir.

678
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:13,000
- Can you please contact her?
- Yes, sir.

679
00:45:13,083 --> 00:45:14,416
-Okay, after you.
-Shall we?

680
00:45:15,541 --> 00:45:16,375
Okay.

681
00:45:17,791 --> 00:45:19,041
What would you like?

682
00:45:19,125 --> 00:45:20,750
I would prefer Padang food.

683
00:45:20,833 --> 00:45:22,541
-It's very tasty here.
-Really?

684
00:45:22,625 --> 00:45:24,250
Sir, were you looking for me?

685
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:26,083
Yeah. So,

686
00:45:26,958 --> 00:45:28,916
Helen suddenly asked to eat here.

687
00:45:29,416 --> 00:45:30,250
Oh.

688
00:45:31,291 --> 00:45:32,875
-Hello.
-Hi.

689
00:45:34,166 --> 00:45:36,958
-Feel free to order, Helen. It's fine.
-I can order first?

690
00:45:40,125 --> 00:45:41,708
This is not in the rundown, right?

691
00:45:42,208 --> 00:45:43,416
-No, sir.
-Yes, it's not.

692
00:45:46,166 --> 00:45:47,583
What do I do now?

693
00:45:47,666 --> 00:45:50,166
-It's okay. Just go with the flow.
-Where have you been?

694
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:53,083
I had something to do.
This is fine. Just go with it.

695
00:45:53,166 --> 00:45:54,958
What do you mean? I've never been here!

696
00:45:55,041 --> 00:45:55,875
Can I have capcay…

697
00:45:55,958 --> 00:45:57,083
What do you mean?

698
00:45:57,166 --> 00:45:59,708
Just order some food. Act natural.

699
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:02,416
I have never eaten here before!

700
00:46:03,291 --> 00:46:07,250
I’ll text you the menu
and how to order it.

701
00:46:07,333 --> 00:46:08,500
Don’t go too far from me.

702
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:10,000
Me?

703
00:46:10,083 --> 00:46:12,000
Yes, you! Don’t go too far. Stay close.

704
00:46:12,083 --> 00:46:14,166
Wear your earphones or something.

705
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:15,791
Don't stop texting me!

706
00:46:15,875 --> 00:46:17,791
It’s so hot in here, it's insane.

707
00:46:19,083 --> 00:46:20,458
I'll open my blazer.

708
00:46:20,541 --> 00:46:21,500
It’s boiling hot.

709
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:23,166
Yes, thank you.

710
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:24,875
-Are you recording?
-Yes.

711
00:46:24,958 --> 00:46:26,541
Hey, what should I eat?

712
00:46:28,833 --> 00:46:29,958
Okay, thank you.

713
00:46:31,083 --> 00:46:32,166
Oh, sorry.

714
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:36,666
Yes. You should try this one.
It’s different.

715
00:46:37,541 --> 00:46:38,750
-Different?
-Yeah.

716
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:39,666
Okay.

717
00:46:41,125 --> 00:46:42,833
-Looks good.
-Right?

718
00:46:44,083 --> 00:46:45,500
Do you want to make an order?

719
00:46:45,583 --> 00:46:47,041
-Yes.
-Yes.

720
00:46:47,125 --> 00:46:47,958
Ratih?

721
00:46:50,958 --> 00:46:53,291
-It's Rani, sir.
-Rani! I'm so sorry.

722
00:46:53,916 --> 00:46:55,750
I'd like to order…

723
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:59,416
-Order what, sir?
-I'd like to order some food.

724
00:47:03,625 --> 00:47:04,833
MENUS YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW

725
00:47:04,916 --> 00:47:09,500
I'd like to order stir-fried squid,

726
00:47:09,583 --> 00:47:12,000
stir-fried tempeh,

727
00:47:12,083 --> 00:47:15,208
musta… mustafo… mustofa potatoes,

728
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:17,500
and green beans.

729
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,791
-Please wait, sir.
-Sure, thank you.

730
00:47:23,083 --> 00:47:24,958
Do you like doing impromptu visits too?

731
00:47:25,041 --> 00:47:29,541
Not really, I’m not a politician.
But I’m used to eating here.

732
00:47:30,416 --> 00:47:32,208
-To blend in.
-Yeah.

733
00:47:36,833 --> 00:47:38,250
-Reuben.
-Yes?

734
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:40,458
-Can I ask you something?
-Sure.

735
00:47:41,041 --> 00:47:43,666
Out of all the candidates,

736
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:46,208
I mean, the ten finalists…

737
00:47:46,291 --> 00:47:49,416
If none of us is suitable for you,

738
00:47:49,916 --> 00:47:51,666
will you cancel the show?

739
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:54,333
Or must there be a winner?

740
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,833
Here you go, sir. Your order.

741
00:48:01,916 --> 00:48:03,458
Oh, yes. Thank you.

742
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:13,291
WHAT IF I SAID
THAT I’VE ALREADY FOUND THE WINNER?

743
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,666
Then, let me ask you something.

744
00:48:17,458 --> 00:48:18,291
What is it?

745
00:48:18,875 --> 00:48:22,083
What if I told you
that I’ve already found the winner?

746
00:48:24,291 --> 00:48:25,208
Bon appétit.

747
00:48:32,125 --> 00:48:32,958
Eat it!

748
00:48:33,458 --> 00:48:34,333
You like it?

749
00:48:34,416 --> 00:48:36,083
Yeah, I really do.

750
00:48:36,708 --> 00:48:37,625
I'm allergic.

751
00:49:00,208 --> 00:49:07,125
WE'LL ANNOUNCE THE WINNER TOMORROW.
ARE YOU NERVOUS?

752
00:49:10,125 --> 00:49:14,083
SHOULDN'T YOU BE THE ONE
FEELING NERVOUS, SIR?

753
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,625
ACTUALLY, IT'S THE FINALISTS.

754
00:49:16,708 --> 00:49:22,000
OR YOU, BECAUSE YOUR MAINSTAY PROGRAM
IS ALMOST OVER.

755
00:49:25,333 --> 00:49:30,250
IT'S YOUR PROGRAM, MR. REUBEN.

756
00:50:19,291 --> 00:50:20,291
Sir?

757
00:50:21,625 --> 00:50:22,583
It’s time.

758
00:50:25,041 --> 00:50:28,708
Oh, sorry.
Are you talking with the late Mr. Gunadi?

759
00:50:33,041 --> 00:50:35,750
We rarely talked,
even when he was still alive.

760
00:50:37,416 --> 00:50:39,916
When we did,
it usually ended with a fight.

761
00:50:47,458 --> 00:50:48,708
Sir…

762
00:50:51,416 --> 00:50:53,958
My apologies, sir,
but we're running out of time.

763
00:50:56,333 --> 00:50:59,833
Honestly, I haven’t found the answer

764
00:50:59,916 --> 00:51:04,083
about my criteria
of the most beautiful girl in the world.

765
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:11,708
Now you should be able
to answer that easily, sir.

766
00:51:13,125 --> 00:51:15,458
Your version
of the most beautiful girl in the world

767
00:51:15,541 --> 00:51:18,625
will be inside the woman
that you will choose tonight.

768
00:51:23,791 --> 00:51:24,625
Excuse me.

769
00:51:26,916 --> 00:51:28,125
Okay.

770
00:51:30,333 --> 00:51:32,833
All of Indonesia
and your future wife are waiting.

771
00:51:33,333 --> 00:51:34,166
Let's go.

772
00:51:48,583 --> 00:51:50,250
AWARDS NIGHT

773
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:52,625

THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN THE WORLD
SPECIAL SEASON

779
00:52:09,958 --> 00:52:11,125
All right, welcome back

780
00:52:11,208 --> 00:52:14,750
to The Most Beautiful Girl in the World,
Special Season,

781
00:52:14,833 --> 00:52:16,958
with me again, and also Reuben.

782
00:52:17,041 --> 00:52:21,083
And today, we have ten
of the most beautiful girls

783
00:52:21,166 --> 00:52:23,083
from all over Indonesia.

784
00:52:23,166 --> 00:52:26,208
And girls,
all of you are looking gorgeous.

785
00:52:27,666 --> 00:52:31,291
Reuben, you must be nervous.
How are you feeling today?

786
00:52:32,291 --> 00:52:33,125
A bit nervous.

787
00:52:33,666 --> 00:52:38,083
But honestly, I'm also relieved
because we've made it to the final.

788
00:52:38,166 --> 00:52:39,708
The night we’ve been waiting for.

789
00:52:40,291 --> 00:52:43,791
Are you certain of your final choice?

790
00:52:43,875 --> 00:52:44,708
Yes, I am.

791
00:52:44,791 --> 00:52:48,416
Is it from one of them? Or maybe me?

792
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,250
Definitely one of them.

793
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,291
Oh, okay.

794
00:52:51,375 --> 00:52:54,166
-Fine, let's cut to the chase, Reuben.
-Yeah.

795
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:56,041
-The time is yours.
-Thank you.

796
00:52:56,541 --> 00:52:57,791
Thanks, Patricia.

797
00:52:57,875 --> 00:53:00,333
First, I would like to thank you all.

798
00:53:00,416 --> 00:53:04,541
Please put your hands together again
for all the finalists here. Thank you.

799
00:53:07,041 --> 00:53:08,083
Okay.

800
00:53:08,166 --> 00:53:09,541
I’ve already decided.

801
00:53:09,625 --> 00:53:12,458
And I choose…

802
00:53:19,375 --> 00:53:20,500
Helen Kusuma.

803
00:53:23,375 --> 00:53:26,250
Congratulations, Helen Kusuma!

804
00:53:32,041 --> 00:53:37,958
All right, we invite Reuben
to give her a precious token.

805
00:53:42,208 --> 00:53:45,041
Dude, please zoom in on Camera 3.

806
00:53:45,125 --> 00:53:47,458
-Okay.
-Uh-huh. It's a good moment to capture.

807
00:53:50,041 --> 00:53:51,625
Nice.

808
00:53:55,125 --> 00:53:56,916
-Reuben, give her a hug.
-Okay.

809
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,291
What about a kiss?

810
00:54:02,916 --> 00:54:04,875
We'll do that later. When it’s official.

811
00:54:04,958 --> 00:54:08,000
Oh, yeah! All right.

812
00:54:09,041 --> 00:54:12,208
Thank you to the other beautiful women.

813
00:54:12,291 --> 00:54:14,458
See you. Bye.

814
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:22,916
Congratulations!

815
00:54:31,958 --> 00:54:33,458
-Mr. Reuben!
-Hi, Mr. Reuben!

816
00:54:33,541 --> 00:54:35,250
-Hi, Mr. Reuben!
-Hi!

817
00:54:35,333 --> 00:54:37,041
I’m so impressed with you.

818
00:54:37,125 --> 00:54:39,125
You prepared this party for them.

819
00:54:39,625 --> 00:54:41,750
They worked hard
during the past three months.

820
00:54:41,833 --> 00:54:43,000
-Hi, Jim.
-Boss.

821
00:54:43,083 --> 00:54:44,000
-Helen.
-Hi.

822
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,291
I want to talk to him. Walk you there?

823
00:54:46,375 --> 00:54:47,208
Okay.

824
00:54:47,291 --> 00:54:48,583
-Just a sec, Jim.
-Sure.

825
00:54:52,625 --> 00:54:53,458
Alin!

826
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:55,750
Please help.

827
00:54:57,666 --> 00:54:58,625
Careful.

828
00:54:58,708 --> 00:55:00,916
-Thank you.
-You're welcome. Thank you, Alin.

829
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:06,250
What is it, boss?

830
00:55:07,041 --> 00:55:07,875
Where’s Kiara?

831
00:55:09,583 --> 00:55:10,500
You miss her?

832
00:55:11,333 --> 00:55:13,083
I was just asking.

833
00:55:13,166 --> 00:55:14,625
This is her show too.

834
00:55:15,833 --> 00:55:17,208
There she is!

835
00:55:18,166 --> 00:55:19,375
Sorry I'm late, sir.

836
00:55:22,333 --> 00:55:23,375
I’ll leave now, boss.

837
00:55:24,916 --> 00:55:25,791
Me too, sir.

838
00:55:25,875 --> 00:55:26,708
-Kiara.
-Yes?

839
00:55:26,791 --> 00:55:28,333
Why do you look so tired?

840
00:55:28,416 --> 00:55:30,541
Uh, it’s okay, sir.

841
00:55:31,291 --> 00:55:34,708
I just finished the report.
Pulled an all-nighter. Just the usual.

842
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:40,291
Jimmy probably prepared a lot of drinks.

843
00:55:40,375 --> 00:55:41,833
You shouldn't drink right now.

844
00:55:41,916 --> 00:55:44,125
Just eat some food, then take a rest.

845
00:55:44,208 --> 00:55:48,083
Didn't get enough sleep, right?
Just sit down and relax.

846
00:55:48,166 --> 00:55:50,458
-I’ll just drink water then.
-Water is good.

847
00:55:50,541 --> 00:55:52,791
-Ten gallons, sir?
-Ten… gallons.

848
00:56:54,833 --> 00:56:59,583
CONGRATULATIONS, REUBEN.
I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU. MOM.

849
00:57:29,166 --> 00:57:31,333
You’re polluting the sea.

850
00:57:33,041 --> 00:57:34,208
Haven't you eaten?

851
00:57:35,625 --> 00:57:36,458
I have, sir.

852
00:57:38,333 --> 00:57:39,166
Thank you.

853
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:41,666
Gosh.

854
00:57:42,541 --> 00:57:45,416
-I should have recorded that.
-Please don't.

855
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:48,166
I’m seasick.
It's not because of the alcohol.

856
00:57:49,583 --> 00:57:51,208
Jimmy said you have tummy problems?

857
00:57:51,291 --> 00:57:53,250
Why would he tell you that?

858
00:57:53,333 --> 00:57:55,541
-Because I asked him.
-What did you ask?

859
00:57:55,625 --> 00:57:57,041
I asked about you.

860
00:57:58,375 --> 00:58:01,666
But why would he tell you
about my stomach problems?

861
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:05,833
Because I asked in detail.
I want to know my producer's character.

862
00:58:05,916 --> 00:58:07,208
But for what purpose?

863
00:58:08,208 --> 00:58:09,458
I just wanted to know.

864
00:58:09,541 --> 00:58:11,916
Are we going to talk about this
until morning?

865
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:14,833
Yes.

866
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:16,416
-No.
-Okay.

867
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,750
Kiara, your work is amazing.

868
00:58:18,833 --> 00:58:20,625
I'd like to offer you a bonus.

869
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:24,583
The waves are scary. That's unusual.

870
00:58:27,583 --> 00:58:28,750
-Whoa.
-Wow.

871
00:58:29,333 --> 00:58:35,166
Sir, I'm officially
a full-time producer now, right?

872
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:37,375
That’s for sure. But that’s not a bonus.

873
00:58:37,458 --> 00:58:39,375
It's about a bonus. What do you want?

874
00:58:41,041 --> 00:58:42,041
An apartment?

875
00:58:42,125 --> 00:58:43,000
Huh?

876
00:58:45,458 --> 00:58:46,416
Sir! Oh, no!

877
00:59:25,791 --> 00:59:28,916
Sir? Mr. Reuben!

878
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,708
Sir? Mr. Reub--

879
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:33,500
Are you okay, sir?

880
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:40,625
We're…

881
00:59:41,875 --> 00:59:43,000
Damn it.

882
00:59:43,083 --> 00:59:43,916
Shit.

883
00:59:52,416 --> 00:59:53,500
Where are we?

884
00:59:54,541 --> 00:59:57,375
I think we’re on one of the islands
of the Thousand Islands.

885
00:59:57,958 --> 01:00:02,500
Then there must be someone
living on this kind of island, right?

886
01:00:02,583 --> 01:00:06,375
Sir, Thousand Islands
is made up of 110 islands,

887
01:00:06,458 --> 01:00:08,250
and only 11 of them are inhabited.

888
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:11,375
Maybe we're on one of those 11 out of 110.

889
01:00:11,458 --> 01:00:14,541
If there were locals here,
someone should've found us by now.

890
01:00:14,625 --> 01:00:16,375
Because we didn’t look for help.

891
01:00:16,458 --> 01:00:18,083
-We should look around.
-Fine.

892
01:00:18,166 --> 01:00:21,833
Let's walk along the coastline.
We can estimate the size of this island.

893
01:00:21,916 --> 01:00:24,208
-I don’t know. Let’s find help first.
-Fine.

894
01:00:24,291 --> 01:00:26,375
Don't just wait here. I'm not panicking.

895
01:00:26,458 --> 01:00:28,583
-Let's move.
-I didn’t say you're panicking.

896
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:29,500
Hello!

897
01:00:29,583 --> 01:00:31,583
-Don’t walk too fast.
-An island this big,

898
01:00:31,666 --> 01:00:34,500
-there must be someone. It's impossible.
-Okay, calm down.

899
01:00:34,583 --> 01:00:37,708
What should we do?
Isn't there any help here? Impossible!

900
01:00:37,791 --> 01:00:40,333
Hello! Anybody here?

901
01:00:43,333 --> 01:00:45,708
How come no one on the boat
realized we’re missing?

902
01:00:45,791 --> 01:00:47,500
-They don't know?
-It was crowded.

903
01:00:47,583 --> 01:00:48,625
Hello?

904
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:05,875
-Sir.
-Yeah?

905
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:07,916
These are our footprints.

906
01:01:10,916 --> 01:01:12,791
We’re back to where we started.

907
01:01:14,708 --> 01:01:17,416
-Oh, yeah.
-The whole island is only this big.

908
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,125
How come there’s no one here?

909
01:01:20,125 --> 01:01:21,458
What should we do now?

910
01:01:27,208 --> 01:01:28,708
Okay, I’m…

911
01:01:29,791 --> 01:01:31,291
I'm going to enter the island

912
01:01:31,375 --> 01:01:32,791
-to look for fresh water.
-Huh?

913
01:01:32,875 --> 01:01:37,083
Humans can survive 30 days without food,
but only three days without water.

914
01:01:37,666 --> 01:01:40,041
So, I’ll go look for fresh water.

915
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:45,666
Sounds like you often get stranded.
How do you know those things?

916
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:47,666
I was once an assistant producer

917
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:50,083
for an adventure show around Indonesia
on WinTV.

918
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:54,666
-Can you climb over?
-Of course. It’s easy.

919
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:55,583
Okay.

920
01:01:56,916 --> 01:01:57,750
Ow!

921
01:02:00,375 --> 01:02:03,750
Are you sure we should go inside?
We don’t know what’s in here.

922
01:02:03,833 --> 01:02:07,041
If we get lost, sir,
we’ll just find a way back to shore again.

923
01:02:07,125 --> 01:02:13,333
Still, it's scary to explore
without knowing what’s in there.

924
01:02:13,416 --> 01:02:15,458
Don’t you just want to sit by the shore?

925
01:02:15,541 --> 01:02:18,166
Let's just wait and stay there.

926
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:22,083
We can sit down. Maybe someone will come.
It'll be easier for them to find us.

927
01:02:22,166 --> 01:02:23,583
If we go deeper inside,

928
01:02:23,666 --> 01:02:27,083
the people who'll come to the shore
to save us will get confused.

929
01:02:27,166 --> 01:02:28,958
They’ll have to search in the woods.

930
01:02:29,041 --> 01:02:31,541
You remember what was happening
when we fell last night?

931
01:02:32,083 --> 01:02:33,500
-There was a party.
-Mm-hmm.

932
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:36,916
It'll take them at least one or two hours
to realize we're missing.

933
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,875
After that, they have to search
all the islands in Thousand Islands.

934
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:44,208
At least seven to ten days
for them to find us.

935
01:02:44,291 --> 01:02:46,500
Watch what you're saying.

936
01:02:46,583 --> 01:02:48,666
We're talking about seven to ten days!

937
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:50,583
That's… Ow!

938
01:02:51,166 --> 01:02:52,416
Ten days? That's crazy!

939
01:03:18,625 --> 01:03:19,708
What are you doing?

940
01:03:20,291 --> 01:03:21,750
Sitting down. Lose the attitude!

941
01:03:26,708 --> 01:03:27,666
What is it?

942
01:03:29,541 --> 01:03:30,375
Kiara?

943
01:03:39,041 --> 01:03:40,708
Kia? Why are you drinking like that?

944
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:42,458
This is fresh water.

945
01:03:42,541 --> 01:03:44,541
We don't know if it's sterile or not.

946
01:03:47,083 --> 01:03:49,541
So, you don't want to drink?
Fine, it's up to you.

947
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:50,500
Well, I…

948
01:03:51,166 --> 01:03:53,916
Sure, I want to drink.
But I want to see your reaction first.

949
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,750
-If you're fine, then I'll drink it. If--
-This is clean, sir.

950
01:03:58,250 --> 01:04:00,666
It hasn't been boiled yet.
We haven't cooked it.

951
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:02,583
Do you see a kitchen here, sir? A stove?

952
01:04:02,666 --> 01:04:04,250
A five-star restaurant? No, right?

953
01:04:04,333 --> 01:04:05,958
Why are you suddenly being rude?

954
01:04:06,041 --> 01:04:07,541
You were fine just a moment ago.

955
01:04:07,625 --> 01:04:09,458
It's impossible when stranded with you!

956
01:04:09,541 --> 01:04:12,375
-Oh, now you're being informal?
-Yeah. So what? Don't like it?

957
01:04:12,458 --> 01:04:13,416
-I don't.
-Listen.

958
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,125
You're not my boss here.

959
01:04:15,208 --> 01:04:17,375
I don't know
how long we're going to be here

960
01:04:17,458 --> 01:04:19,583
and I will not be responsible
for your safety.

961
01:04:19,666 --> 01:04:22,041
You want to drink or not, I don't care!

962
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:23,000
Kiara?

963
01:04:23,083 --> 01:04:24,666
Kiara! I'm not done talking!

964
01:04:25,625 --> 01:04:28,333
Find a bottle, fill it with water,
take it to the beach.

965
01:04:28,416 --> 01:04:29,833
Then we'll build a shelter.

966
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:31,166
Okay.

967
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:05,666
-Can you do it?
-Yes, I can.

968
01:06:06,208 --> 01:06:07,333
Want me to do it?

969
01:06:11,916 --> 01:06:13,333
It's working! The fire is lit!

970
01:06:13,416 --> 01:06:14,750
-Really?
-It's smoking!

971
01:06:19,166 --> 01:06:23,083
Congratulations! You won the world record
for the longest time to start a fire.

972
01:06:23,833 --> 01:06:24,916
Truly the best!

973
01:06:25,583 --> 01:06:27,250
I was just about to give up, Ben.

974
01:06:27,958 --> 01:06:29,500
You didn't give up on me, right?

975
01:06:57,083 --> 01:06:58,500
You did okay today.

976
01:07:00,083 --> 01:07:03,000
As someone who didn't know his way
around a food stall yesterday,

977
01:07:03,083 --> 01:07:04,125
this is not bad.

978
01:07:04,208 --> 01:07:06,583
Well, thanks, I guess.

979
01:07:11,541 --> 01:07:13,416
We'll try fishing for food tomorrow.

980
01:07:14,416 --> 01:07:17,958
We should take turns.
One person sleeps, the other keeps watch.

981
01:07:18,041 --> 01:07:19,375
Who'll go first?

982
01:07:19,916 --> 01:07:21,583
I'll take the first watch.

983
01:07:21,666 --> 01:07:23,375
You go ahead and sleep. Ladies first.

984
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:25,916
Okay.

985
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,333
I actually don't know
what to watch out for.

986
01:07:28,416 --> 01:07:30,750
We're the only ones on this island.
Nobody's here.

987
01:07:31,791 --> 01:07:32,625
Well,

988
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:37,708
we never know what animals are out there.

989
01:07:37,791 --> 01:07:41,291
-There could be snakes or something else.
-Huh? Hey!

990
01:07:41,375 --> 01:07:42,833
Don't speak so carelessly.

991
01:07:43,875 --> 01:07:47,041
Wait, don't go to sleep yet!
I don't know how to handle snakes.

992
01:07:47,125 --> 01:07:48,958
Just talk to them, Ben.

993
01:07:49,041 --> 01:07:52,416
Ask them about their life goals

994
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:55,000
and why they want to be a snake.

995
01:07:55,916 --> 01:08:00,625
Make sure the fire doesn't go out,
or we'll get cold.

996
01:08:00,708 --> 01:08:04,083
Maybe a ship will sail by us
and they will see the fire.

997
01:08:04,166 --> 01:08:07,333
You can shout for help if that happens.

998
01:08:08,333 --> 01:08:09,833
I thought I should shout,

999
01:08:09,916 --> 01:08:12,583
"Hey, what are your life goals?"

1000
01:08:12,666 --> 01:08:15,625
"Why do you want to be a ship?" Right?

1001
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:19,083
Please wake me up in three or four hours.

1002
01:08:20,083 --> 01:08:21,208
Does your watch work?

1003
01:08:22,041 --> 01:08:23,750
Sure, it's a Rolex!

1004
01:09:00,375 --> 01:09:01,625
Ben!

1005
01:09:02,375 --> 01:09:04,916
Wake up! Why didn't you wake me up?

1006
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,916
What is it? I just went to sleep.

1007
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,166
You're lying! I bet you fell asleep.

1008
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:11,708
No, I didn't. I just went to sleep.

1009
01:09:13,083 --> 01:09:14,833
The firewood is already cold,

1010
01:09:14,916 --> 01:09:17,375
which means
the fire has been out for a few hours now.

1011
01:09:17,458 --> 01:09:20,666
No. I wanted to wake you up,
but didn't have the heart to do so.

1012
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:22,000
You were sleeping soundly.

1013
01:09:22,083 --> 01:09:24,250
I just fell asleep.
Figured I'll keep watch.

1014
01:09:27,041 --> 01:09:27,875
Okay. Get up.

1015
01:09:27,958 --> 01:09:29,166
-For what?
-Fishing.

1016
01:09:29,250 --> 01:09:30,875
Don't you want to eat? Let's go!

1017
01:09:33,875 --> 01:09:36,791
How can we go fishing?
We don't have any equipment.

1018
01:10:17,166 --> 01:10:18,833
Ben, I got one!

1019
01:10:31,458 --> 01:10:32,541
What?

1020
01:10:33,875 --> 01:10:35,791
-Didn't you say it's hot?
-It is!

1021
01:10:45,416 --> 01:10:48,916
SOS

1022
01:11:52,958 --> 01:11:54,666
You didn't wake me up again.

1023
01:11:57,583 --> 01:12:01,708
The last text I got was from my mom,
and I haven't replied yet.

1024
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,000
So…

1025
01:12:08,625 --> 01:12:10,666
how is your relationship with your mom?

1026
01:12:11,708 --> 01:12:14,500
Sorry. I'm just asking if you don't mind.

1027
01:12:23,916 --> 01:12:30,583
She left my father and I
when I was just a child.

1028
01:12:31,666 --> 01:12:32,875
For no reason at all.

1029
01:12:34,125 --> 01:12:36,083
Even now, I still don't know.

1030
01:12:36,166 --> 01:12:39,875
I mean, why did she have to leave us?

1031
01:12:41,708 --> 01:12:44,416
Sometimes,
I'm still looking for the answer.

1032
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:47,125
Maybe she doesn't love me?
Or she doesn't love my father?

1033
01:12:47,875 --> 01:12:50,000
I finally realized that maybe

1034
01:12:51,166 --> 01:12:54,541
love could run out.

1035
01:12:57,666 --> 01:13:01,541
Has she ever looked for you?

1036
01:13:04,166 --> 01:13:05,791
Didn't even come to Dad's funeral.

1037
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,500
About that apartment…
Why do you want it so badly?

1038
01:13:29,458 --> 01:13:31,083
How nice do you want it?

1039
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:36,125
Well, just a regular apartment.
No need to be too nice.

1040
01:13:36,791 --> 01:13:42,333
But as someone who has been living in…
What's the right word?

1041
01:13:43,875 --> 01:13:45,916
An uncomfortable place, I guess?

1042
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,416
I just want to live in a place

1043
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:52,916
that suits my needs and preferences.

1044
01:13:55,166 --> 01:13:56,250
And your parents?

1045
01:13:56,333 --> 01:13:58,291
-They have passed away.
-Oh, sorry.

1046
01:13:58,791 --> 01:13:59,666
It's okay.

1047
01:14:00,166 --> 01:14:02,208
They died when I was still in college.

1048
01:14:02,708 --> 01:14:06,208
And I don't have any siblings,
so I live alone.

1049
01:14:09,458 --> 01:14:11,375
What is your biggest dream, Ki?

1050
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:15,041
Is this a job interview?

1051
01:14:16,916 --> 01:14:18,541
I already told you. That apartment.

1052
01:14:19,416 --> 01:14:22,000
Your biggest dream is owning an apartment?

1053
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:26,541
For someone like me,
having a decent home is an achievement.

1054
01:14:26,625 --> 01:14:28,583
Okay. All right.

1055
01:14:30,666 --> 01:14:31,541
What's yours?

1056
01:14:33,125 --> 01:14:35,166
Reforming WinTV.

1057
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:41,666
I mean, I want WinTV
to become a classy TV station.

1058
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:47,208
A station with high-quality programs,
not just focusing on ratings and ads.

1059
01:14:47,291 --> 01:14:50,250
If I get the opportunity to lead WinTV,

1060
01:14:50,333 --> 01:14:56,458
I might eliminate programs
like The Most Beautiful Girl in the World.

1061
01:14:56,541 --> 01:14:58,416
-Gone.
-Gone. Poof!

1062
01:14:58,500 --> 01:14:59,541
Disappear.

1063
01:15:01,666 --> 01:15:05,291
My father was always in denial
about the decline of TV stations.

1064
01:15:06,416 --> 01:15:09,250
But I actually think of it
as a huge opportunity

1065
01:15:09,333 --> 01:15:11,708
that can be turned into a positive impact.

1066
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:19,250
You can use…

1067
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:23,208
The last program I worked on
as an assistant producer.

1068
01:15:23,791 --> 01:15:24,791
Which one?

1069
01:15:24,875 --> 01:15:28,791
The one about traveling around Indonesia.
You can totally revive that.

1070
01:15:28,875 --> 01:15:30,208
It's a great program.

1071
01:15:31,208 --> 01:15:33,750
You do have other dreams
besides having an apartment.

1072
01:15:36,083 --> 01:15:38,458
That's different. That's not a dream.

1073
01:15:38,541 --> 01:15:41,500
-It's a life goal. A dream, right?
-No, it's not. That's a plan.

1074
01:15:41,583 --> 01:15:44,500
-What's the difference between the two?
-It's different.

1075
01:15:44,583 --> 01:15:49,333
Dreams that are not fulfilled
will make us sad.

1076
01:15:49,416 --> 01:15:53,750
For plans, if they do not happen,
it will just annoy us.

1077
01:15:53,833 --> 01:15:57,958
To be honest, I was expecting
a more philosophical answer than that.

1078
01:15:58,041 --> 01:16:01,541
I'm sorry,
I guess that wasn't very philosophical.

1079
01:16:01,625 --> 01:16:02,958
Let me try that again.

1080
01:16:04,416 --> 01:16:08,458
A plan is outlined in a proposal.

1081
01:16:08,541 --> 01:16:13,041
Whereas a dream is formulated and spoken

1082
01:16:13,125 --> 01:16:15,333
in our hearts every time we pray.

1083
01:16:15,416 --> 01:16:17,041
And before we fell off the ship.

1084
01:16:18,041 --> 01:16:19,250
-Am I right?
-Yeah.

1085
01:16:19,791 --> 01:16:21,083
Yes, you're right.

1086
01:16:21,166 --> 01:16:22,833
Is this cooked? Is it done?

1087
01:16:22,916 --> 01:16:23,916
Should be done now.

1088
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:25,833
-Let's try it.
-Try it.

1089
01:16:35,375 --> 01:16:38,958
We've eaten this a few times now,
and it's also tasty without seasoning.

1090
01:16:39,041 --> 01:16:41,083
-Right?
-Maybe because we're hungry? Or what?

1091
01:16:41,166 --> 01:16:42,416
-No. It's fresh.
-That's it.

1092
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:43,833
-That's right.
-It's fresh.

1093
01:16:44,416 --> 01:16:47,833
Once we're back in Jakarta,
I'll take you to a French restaurant.

1094
01:16:47,916 --> 01:16:51,333
The food is amazing.
Their fish is so good!

1095
01:16:52,666 --> 01:16:53,583
No way.

1096
01:16:54,083 --> 01:16:57,958
The best grilled fish ever
is the one in Benhil. Ever tried it?

1097
01:16:58,708 --> 01:16:59,958
-No.
-No?

1098
01:17:00,041 --> 01:17:01,250
We'll go there someday.

1099
01:17:02,375 --> 01:17:04,875
Not everything that is the best
has to be expensive.

1100
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:16,333
What?

1101
01:17:16,875 --> 01:17:18,083
-What is it?
-Nothing.

1102
01:17:19,375 --> 01:17:20,208
Well?

1103
01:17:20,291 --> 01:17:21,541
-Nothing.
-Okay.

1104
01:17:29,166 --> 01:17:30,666
I still can’t believe it.

1105
01:17:32,208 --> 01:17:34,750
That you got stranded
with Reuben Wiraatmadja?

1106
01:17:35,916 --> 01:17:37,083
What a nuisance.

1107
01:17:39,458 --> 01:17:40,916
Gosh, I'm choking.

1108
01:17:42,416 --> 01:17:45,250
I'd rather be stranded with dolphins.

1109
01:17:47,791 --> 01:17:48,791
My gosh!

1110
01:17:49,916 --> 01:17:51,208
So, what can't you believe?

1111
01:17:51,291 --> 01:17:53,125
That thing you said earlier.

1112
01:17:54,291 --> 01:18:00,625
About you wanting to eliminate
The Most Beautiful Girl in the World.

1113
01:18:00,708 --> 01:18:01,750
Oh, right.

1114
01:18:02,458 --> 01:18:07,833
From the beginning, I only participated
in that show to fulfill my dad’s wish.

1115
01:18:07,916 --> 01:18:10,416
And after it's done,
I figured that was it.

1116
01:18:12,208 --> 01:18:13,375
I think I've found…

1117
01:18:16,125 --> 01:18:17,916
what I’ve been looking for.

1118
01:18:26,041 --> 01:18:28,083
The most beautiful girl in the world?

1119
01:18:28,583 --> 01:18:29,416
Yes.

1120
01:18:44,791 --> 01:18:45,666
Helen Kusuma.

1121
01:19:04,458 --> 01:19:06,000
-The waves are huge, huh?
-Whoa.

1122
01:19:06,083 --> 01:19:09,250
I know, right?
Will it reach all the way here?

1123
01:19:09,333 --> 01:19:10,333
I don’t think so.

1124
01:19:11,333 --> 01:19:12,250
Ben!

1125
01:19:12,333 --> 01:19:13,833
Ben…

1126
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:15,958
Ben, move!

1127
01:19:17,041 --> 01:19:19,791
It’s been five days
since Reuben Wiraatmadja went missing.

1128
01:19:19,875 --> 01:19:20,916
Any clarification?

1129
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,041
For now, the rescue team
is still conducting their search.

1130
01:19:24,625 --> 01:19:28,750
A producer, Kiara Clarissa,
was also declared missing with Reuben.

1131
01:19:29,416 --> 01:19:30,916
Any explanation about this?

1132
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,708
We haven't gotten the latest news,

1133
01:19:32,791 --> 01:19:38,041
but we suspect
that Kiara also fell into the sea.

1134
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:46,291
Once again, I’m asking for your help
to protect our privacy as their family.

1135
01:19:46,375 --> 01:19:50,041
You already consider yourself
an official member of the family?

1136
01:19:53,541 --> 01:19:56,458
You don’t have to respond
to all the reporters.

1137
01:19:56,541 --> 01:19:57,375
-Sir?
-Yes?

1138
01:19:57,458 --> 01:19:59,583
This is Kiara’s best friend, Dita.

1139
01:19:59,666 --> 01:20:01,166
-Right.
-I'm Dita.

1140
01:20:01,250 --> 01:20:02,625
-I'm Agung.
-Helen.

1141
01:20:03,958 --> 01:20:05,208
She wants to help too.

1142
01:20:05,708 --> 01:20:06,541
Okay.

1143
01:20:09,916 --> 01:20:10,750
Sir, is that…

1144
01:20:15,958 --> 01:20:17,750
I want to join the search for my son.

1145
01:20:33,166 --> 01:20:34,458
Ben!

1146
01:20:39,958 --> 01:20:42,958
-Why didn't you wake me?
-You wouldn't budge! Get over there!

1147
01:20:43,041 --> 01:20:45,250
Come on. Go! Over there!

1148
01:20:45,333 --> 01:20:46,166
Ben!

1149
01:21:00,125 --> 01:21:01,833
We can still fix that!

1150
01:21:01,916 --> 01:21:03,333
Stop! Just look at me!

1151
01:21:03,416 --> 01:21:05,375
-We can fix it!
-Enough. Don't look at it.

1152
01:21:05,458 --> 01:21:07,458
Look at me. Just look at me.

1153
01:21:08,833 --> 01:21:09,750
Yes, but…

1154
01:21:10,375 --> 01:21:13,208
It's okay! It's all right!

1155
01:22:14,416 --> 01:22:15,250
Morning.

1156
01:22:16,291 --> 01:22:17,125
Morning.

1157
01:22:22,750 --> 01:22:23,583
That's it.

1158
01:22:25,625 --> 01:22:26,625
Okay.

1159
01:22:34,708 --> 01:22:37,541
If it collapses, we'll build it again.
Over and over again.

1160
01:22:37,625 --> 01:22:39,291
And it’s easy to find the resources.

1161
01:22:39,375 --> 01:22:43,791
Fine, then. You should just live here.
I think it suits you.

1162
01:22:43,875 --> 01:22:45,000
That’s a good idea.

1163
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:49,000
I'm serious! It’s okay.
I’m happy living here.

1164
01:22:49,083 --> 01:22:50,000
No burden at all.

1165
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:51,666
All right, then.

1166
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:55,666
So, if a ship comes here to rescue us,

1167
01:22:55,750 --> 01:22:58,416
I’ll go back to Jakarta
and you’ll stay here.

1168
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:01,958
-No way. You have to stay here too.
-Huh?

1169
01:23:02,041 --> 01:23:03,125
Says who?

1170
01:23:03,208 --> 01:23:05,166
You're the one who wants to stay here.

1171
01:23:05,666 --> 01:23:06,958
So, there’s no need to make…

1172
01:23:07,041 --> 01:23:09,625
What was it? The one you wanted to create?

1173
01:23:09,708 --> 01:23:12,625
High-quality programs
without focusing on ratings.

1174
01:23:12,708 --> 01:23:15,041
That needs to be done.
You’ll be the producer.

1175
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:20,958
You told me to stay here.
How can I be the producer?

1176
01:23:21,041 --> 01:23:26,666
If we go back to Jakarta,
we’ll make a good show together.

1177
01:23:26,750 --> 01:23:32,291
But if we have no choice but to stay here,
we'll live together.

1178
01:23:32,375 --> 01:23:34,791
Sorry, I think I'd rather go home.

1179
01:23:42,416 --> 01:23:44,500
You’re so beautiful when you smile.

1180
01:23:48,791 --> 01:23:49,625
Do it often.

1181
01:23:52,791 --> 01:23:54,541
-What's with you?
-It’s true.

1182
01:23:55,041 --> 01:23:57,750
In Jakarta, you always look so bitchy.

1183
01:23:57,833 --> 01:23:58,833
No, I don't!

1184
01:23:58,916 --> 01:24:02,958
I’m not bitchy. I just don't have a reason
to laugh at the office.

1185
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:08,791
When we’re back in Jakarta…

1186
01:24:10,875 --> 01:24:13,166
When we work together again…

1187
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,750
we should have

1188
01:24:19,333 --> 01:24:23,291
a lot of reasons to laugh
and to make you smile.

1189
01:24:25,791 --> 01:24:29,083
I think
you have to make up your mind first.

1190
01:24:29,166 --> 01:24:31,458
Do you want to stay here
or go back to Jakarta?

1191
01:24:31,541 --> 01:24:33,208
You seem very indecisive, sir.

1192
01:24:35,416 --> 01:24:38,791
Actually, it’s not about where I live.

1193
01:24:39,708 --> 01:24:41,958
-Then what?
-It's with whom.

1194
01:24:44,208 --> 01:24:45,750
That’s far more important.

1195
01:24:46,791 --> 01:24:52,041
Because it feels completely different
when we live with someone…

1196
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,750
who can understand us, and vice versa.

1197
01:25:01,125 --> 01:25:02,458
Do we…

1198
01:25:05,458 --> 01:25:06,541
understand each other?

1199
01:25:11,125 --> 01:25:12,625
Was I talking about us?

1200
01:27:28,208 --> 01:27:31,416
NATIONAL SEARCH AND RESCUE AGENCY

1201
01:27:36,291 --> 01:27:38,791

1202

1203
01:27:53,541 --> 01:27:54,375
Reuben!

1204
01:27:55,291 --> 01:27:56,125
Are you okay?

1205
01:27:56,708 --> 01:27:57,541
I'm okay.

1206
01:28:00,916 --> 01:28:02,583
Reuben!

1207
01:28:04,541 --> 01:28:05,708
Oh, Ben!

1208
01:28:21,583 --> 01:28:26,083
Nurse, the girl who was with me…
Where is she?

1209
01:28:26,708 --> 01:28:27,708
She's right outside.

1210
01:28:28,916 --> 01:28:30,791
-Okay.
-I’ll take my leave, sir.

1211
01:28:30,875 --> 01:28:32,750
-Thank you, nurse.
-You're welcome.

1212
01:28:38,583 --> 01:28:39,416
Ki?

1213
01:28:44,625 --> 01:28:45,458
Reuben.

1214
01:28:57,291 --> 01:28:59,083
I’m so grateful you’re okay.

1215
01:29:00,458 --> 01:29:02,041
Why are you only showing up now?

1216
01:29:04,208 --> 01:29:05,583
I felt so guilty.

1217
01:29:05,666 --> 01:29:08,041
I didn’t even have the guts
to reply to your messages.

1218
01:29:08,125 --> 01:29:09,833
But I did reply your last text.

1219
01:29:10,416 --> 01:29:12,750
-Maybe you didn’t receive it.
-Yeah, I didn’t.

1220
01:29:13,375 --> 01:29:14,375
Reuben…

1221
01:29:17,416 --> 01:29:18,916
when I heard you were missing,

1222
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,291
my guilt tortured me even more.

1223
01:29:21,375 --> 01:29:24,541
And finally, I decided to face it.

1224
01:29:25,041 --> 01:29:27,833
You didn’t have enough reason
to come to Dad’s funeral?

1225
01:29:33,583 --> 01:29:34,500
I understand.

1226
01:29:37,083 --> 01:29:39,083
You must have been blaming me
all this time.

1227
01:29:41,416 --> 01:29:44,500
Because, as you know,
I cheated on your father.

1228
01:29:46,083 --> 01:29:49,041
I made the biggest mistake of my life.

1229
01:29:50,291 --> 01:29:51,583
I was young,

1230
01:29:52,583 --> 01:29:55,458
and I had a busy husband
who rarely came home.

1231
01:29:55,541 --> 01:29:58,625
Then suddenly, there was another man
who gave me affection.

1232
01:30:01,625 --> 01:30:03,333
And I accepted it.

1233
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:08,833
But then, I lost everything after that.

1234
01:30:12,833 --> 01:30:14,208
I lost your father…

1235
01:30:17,583 --> 01:30:18,625
and you.

1236
01:30:18,708 --> 01:30:19,750
Then what?

1237
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:24,833
You’ll leave again?

1238
01:30:25,791 --> 01:30:27,458
If you want, I'll leave again--

1239
01:30:27,541 --> 01:30:29,375
"If you want, I'll leave again"?

1240
01:30:29,458 --> 01:30:33,500
You left based on your own decision,
not because I told you to.

1241
01:30:33,583 --> 01:30:35,750
So, don’t turn this on me, Mom.

1242
01:30:36,583 --> 01:30:39,541
Why am I the one…
If you want to leave, then go ahead.

1243
01:30:39,625 --> 01:30:40,791
-It's your call.
-Reuben.

1244
01:30:49,583 --> 01:30:50,666
Please forgive me.

1245
01:30:51,666 --> 01:30:53,666
Forgiveness won't bring Dad back.

1246
01:31:28,791 --> 01:31:30,291
Thank you, all of you.

1247
01:31:31,666 --> 01:31:32,541
Thank you, sir.

1248
01:31:37,583 --> 01:31:38,666
Reuben.

1249
01:31:39,875 --> 01:31:41,916
-My God, I was so worried about you.
-Hey.

1250
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:42,958
-I'm fine.
-You okay?

1251
01:31:43,041 --> 01:31:45,000
-Yeah. Nope.
-Are you hurt?

1252
01:31:45,083 --> 01:31:45,958
What happened?

1253
01:32:09,583 --> 01:32:10,416
Hey.

1254
01:32:13,666 --> 01:32:14,875
Where were you yesterday?

1255
01:32:19,833 --> 01:32:21,250
Is there something urgent, sir?

1256
01:32:22,708 --> 01:32:24,291
The show is over, right?

1257
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:27,125
I’m worried about you.

1258
01:32:30,166 --> 01:32:32,250
Can we continue this in my office?

1259
01:32:34,541 --> 01:32:36,500
-We can do it here, sir.
-Please?

1260
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,000
What’s wrong with you?

1261
01:32:53,291 --> 01:32:54,125
Are you okay?

1262
01:32:55,125 --> 01:32:55,958
All good, sir.

1263
01:32:57,541 --> 01:33:00,041
About what happened earlier with Helen, I…

1264
01:33:02,041 --> 01:33:04,875
I didn’t know
she was going to show up like that.

1265
01:33:06,708 --> 01:33:09,208
And I was just trying to comfort her.

1266
01:33:09,291 --> 01:33:12,666
I don't think
you have to explain anything, sir.

1267
01:33:13,458 --> 01:33:14,458
To tell you the truth.

1268
01:33:17,625 --> 01:33:19,500
There’s nothing between us anyway, right?

1269
01:33:21,416 --> 01:33:22,416
Kiara, please.

1270
01:33:23,833 --> 01:33:25,833
Everything that happened on the island…

1271
01:33:26,708 --> 01:33:27,541
That was real.

1272
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,625
This is not a TV show, sir.

1273
01:33:32,541 --> 01:33:35,541
As I told you,
we have nothing to talk about.

1274
01:33:35,625 --> 01:33:37,500
Which one is real, which one is staged.

1275
01:33:39,541 --> 01:33:42,083
The reality which I realize now

1276
01:33:43,291 --> 01:33:46,166
is that we're in Jakarta,
not on the island.

1277
01:33:46,791 --> 01:33:49,916
You… are my boss.

1278
01:33:52,291 --> 01:33:53,958
And you're about to get married.

1279
01:33:59,583 --> 01:34:01,208
If there’s nothing more to discuss,

1280
01:34:02,625 --> 01:34:03,750
I'll excuse myself.

1281
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,750
Is that all? You're done?

1282
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:10,708
Women can only run away
when there's a problem.

1283
01:34:14,416 --> 01:34:15,791
Well, that’s fine.

1284
01:34:18,458 --> 01:34:21,083
But don’t blame me if I feel like…

1285
01:34:23,125 --> 01:34:24,458
why bother with a commitment?

1286
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:27,416
In the end, we’ll get abandoned anyway.

1287
01:34:28,458 --> 01:34:29,458
What's the point?

1288
01:34:31,083 --> 01:34:34,875
Okay, then.
Just maintain a casual relationship.

1289
01:34:34,958 --> 01:34:37,333
No need to be so serious.
We'll eventually…

1290
01:34:37,416 --> 01:34:38,500
Go ahead, slap me.

1291
01:34:43,958 --> 01:34:45,125
If I slap you…

1292
01:34:48,833 --> 01:34:50,333
you won't feel guilty anymore?

1293
01:34:53,291 --> 01:34:54,500
Don’t confuse this

1294
01:34:54,583 --> 01:34:56,791
with your disappointment
against your mother.

1295
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:00,875
Didn't you think this through?

1296
01:35:01,708 --> 01:35:03,458
You already have a future wife.

1297
01:35:03,541 --> 01:35:06,375
You chose her in front of
millions of Indonesian viewers.

1298
01:35:06,458 --> 01:35:08,666
What exactly is your plan? Cancel it?

1299
01:35:10,791 --> 01:35:12,750
And if you cancel it, then what?

1300
01:35:12,833 --> 01:35:16,041
You're treating Helen the same way
you treated all your previous women.

1301
01:35:19,125 --> 01:35:20,791
Now, forget all of that.

1302
01:35:20,875 --> 01:35:23,875
Just forget it, and ask yourself.

1303
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:25,833
What do you want?

1304
01:35:29,916 --> 01:35:30,958
What do you want?

1305
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:37,750
You don’t know, do you…

1306
01:35:40,416 --> 01:35:41,250
Mr. Reuben?

1307
01:35:43,125 --> 01:35:44,375
Kiara, please.

1308
01:36:03,208 --> 01:36:04,416
So, what now?

1309
01:36:05,166 --> 01:36:06,333
Well, nothing, Dit.

1310
01:36:06,416 --> 01:36:10,208
He will definitely choose… Helen.

1311
01:36:11,583 --> 01:36:13,333
She’s beautiful, smart, and perfect.

1312
01:36:14,791 --> 01:36:18,583
He still has to save
his inheritance, right?

1313
01:36:19,166 --> 01:36:20,833
I wasn't asking about him.

1314
01:36:22,250 --> 01:36:23,416
I was asking about you.

1315
01:36:25,416 --> 01:36:26,750
How about you?

1316
01:36:28,916 --> 01:36:34,291
You know I'm terrified of having a dream.

1317
01:36:34,875 --> 01:36:37,916
The best thing I could dream of
is that apartment.

1318
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:44,375
Turns out, I'm actually right.

1319
01:36:45,833 --> 01:36:46,666
Because,

1320
01:36:47,958 --> 01:36:54,166
the only time I allow myself to dream big…

1321
01:36:57,166 --> 01:37:01,166
it all comes crashing down not long after.

1322
01:37:05,333 --> 01:37:07,333
It hurts to fall, Dit.

1323
01:37:15,291 --> 01:37:19,083
Everyone has the right
to fall in love, Kiara.

1324
01:37:19,875 --> 01:37:23,708
But sometimes it hurts.

1325
01:37:29,291 --> 01:37:33,375
That's why it's called "falling" in love.

1326
01:37:38,416 --> 01:37:39,666
You’ll be fine.

1327
01:37:41,583 --> 01:37:44,291
I’ll be here. All right?

1328
01:38:14,083 --> 01:38:15,708
It's unusual for you to stay long.

1329
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:19,375
Well, I just miss Dad.

1330
01:38:21,458 --> 01:38:22,583
Me too.

1331
01:38:24,458 --> 01:38:26,166
You're finally able to miss him?

1332
01:38:27,625 --> 01:38:30,500
Even though the two of you
were always fighting.

1333
01:38:32,250 --> 01:38:35,541
I always felt
that he could never understand me.

1334
01:38:35,625 --> 01:38:36,916
But at the same time,

1335
01:38:37,583 --> 01:38:43,916
I also never learned
to understand him better.

1336
01:38:44,416 --> 01:38:45,541
But he still tried.

1337
01:38:46,041 --> 01:38:47,125
He tried, Ben.

1338
01:38:47,208 --> 01:38:50,083
And he actually wanted
to get along with you.

1339
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:54,791
I don't remember how he was with me.

1340
01:38:54,875 --> 01:38:57,333
I mean, how he treated me
when I was still a child.

1341
01:38:57,416 --> 01:39:01,125
Well, except from some old videos.

1342
01:39:01,208 --> 01:39:03,000
Your dad was a great guy, Ben.

1343
01:39:03,916 --> 01:39:06,375
He loved you. He loved your mom.

1344
01:39:07,541 --> 01:39:10,916
Maybe he had a unique way
of showing his love, huh?

1345
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:14,125
Well, he's… How should I say it?

1346
01:39:15,166 --> 01:39:17,333
It's hard for him to express his feelings.

1347
01:39:18,333 --> 01:39:21,625
Why did he want me to…

1348
01:39:23,416 --> 01:39:25,333
marry the most beautiful girl
in the world?

1349
01:39:25,416 --> 01:39:26,708
Do you know the real reason?

1350
01:39:29,708 --> 01:39:30,875
I don’t know about that.

1351
01:39:41,166 --> 01:39:42,000
-Thank you.
-Yes.

1352
01:39:50,958 --> 01:39:52,958
Ben, there’s someone who knows more

1353
01:39:53,458 --> 01:39:55,875
and can help you find the answer to that.

1354
01:40:13,250 --> 01:40:14,750
Agung told me everything.

1355
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:18,125
About the inheritance and…

1356
01:40:19,416 --> 01:40:21,250
the most beautiful girl in the world.

1357
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:26,333
Ben,

1358
01:40:27,041 --> 01:40:29,375
you once asked for my help, right?

1359
01:40:41,333 --> 01:40:44,666
I hope this will help you
to understand your dad better.

1360
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:49,125
This is the only video of your dad
that I kept.

1361
01:41:10,041 --> 01:41:10,958
Thank you, Mom.

1362
01:41:33,125 --> 01:41:34,958
-Dad?
-Yes?

1363
01:41:35,041 --> 01:41:38,125
I want to marry
the most beautiful girl in the world.

1364
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:42,208
Do you even know what that means?

1365
01:41:42,708 --> 01:41:44,625
-No, I don't.
-Well…

1366
01:41:45,333 --> 01:41:48,125
If you marry
the most beautiful woman in the world,

1367
01:41:48,208 --> 01:41:50,125
a younger one will then come along,

1368
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:52,666
and she'll be even more beautiful.
Then what?

1369
01:41:53,291 --> 01:41:54,625
I must get a new wife?

1370
01:41:58,375 --> 01:42:00,291
Whose smart boy is this?

1371
01:42:01,083 --> 01:42:03,041
Bet you learned this from your mom.

1372
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:15,666
That's messed up.

1373
01:42:19,208 --> 01:42:22,500
You want to get a new wife?
Replace her with a younger one, huh?

1374
01:42:23,625 --> 01:42:24,666
Did Dad teach you that?

1375
01:42:36,916 --> 01:42:38,750
You're really the best for us.

1376
01:42:44,083 --> 01:42:45,791
The most beautiful girl in the world.

1377
01:42:48,500 --> 01:42:53,375
When did I become
the most beautiful girl in the world?

1378
01:42:55,708 --> 01:42:57,833
Lots of women are more beautiful than me.

1379
01:42:58,875 --> 01:42:59,750
That’s right.

1380
01:43:00,916 --> 01:43:02,291
But they don’t love me,

1381
01:43:04,125 --> 01:43:05,750
and I don’t love them.

1382
01:43:31,541 --> 01:43:32,708
Good afternoon, everyone.

1383
01:43:32,791 --> 01:43:37,166
As the producer, today I will present
the results of our reality show,

1384
01:43:37,250 --> 01:43:39,000
The Most Beautiful Girl in the World.

1385
01:43:39,083 --> 01:43:44,666
You can see that we achieved
an average rating of 3.6% and 20% shares.

1386
01:43:44,750 --> 01:43:47,583
Therefore, we managed
to make a significant contribution

1387
01:43:47,666 --> 01:43:50,000
to WinTV's overall ratings and shares.

1388
01:43:50,083 --> 01:43:53,625
Regarding revenues,
we obtained 15 billion from advertisements

1389
01:43:53,708 --> 01:43:55,875
and 10 billion from sponsorships.

1390
01:43:55,958 --> 01:43:59,625
Which means,
we contributed enough profit for WinTV.

1391
01:44:01,625 --> 01:44:04,791
Next up, here you can see
our social media reach.

1392
01:44:04,875 --> 01:44:07,833
We got positive responses
throughout the season,

1393
01:44:08,500 --> 01:44:11,375
with 20 million impressions

1394
01:44:11,458 --> 01:44:13,791
from all of WinTV's social media

1395
01:44:13,875 --> 01:44:18,125
on platforms such as Facebook,
Instagram, X, YouTube, and TikTok.

1396
01:44:18,958 --> 01:44:22,708
THE WINNER OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL
IN THE WORLD, HELEN KUSUMA

1397
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,458
Next up
is the presentation about the winner,

1398
01:44:26,541 --> 01:44:28,375
which will be delivered by Mr. Reuben.

1399
01:44:31,458 --> 01:44:33,041
-Go ahead, sir.
-Thank you.

1400
01:44:56,666 --> 01:44:58,416
Helen is an amazing woman.

1401
01:45:00,791 --> 01:45:04,208
And I think that statement
doesn't need to be elaborated.

1402
01:45:04,291 --> 01:45:07,625
We now live in an era where everything

1403
01:45:07,708 --> 01:45:10,083
is measured and assessed by numbers.

1404
01:45:10,666 --> 01:45:14,791
When something can't be measured,
it will be considered invalid.

1405
01:45:15,666 --> 01:45:17,166
But in my opinion,

1406
01:45:17,250 --> 01:45:21,458
not everything can be measured
or assessed by numbers.

1407
01:45:21,541 --> 01:45:24,208
I've actually been thinking.

1408
01:45:25,625 --> 01:45:29,250
Why did my father want me to marry
the most beautiful girl in the world?

1409
01:45:29,875 --> 01:45:31,125
What does that mean?

1410
01:45:31,208 --> 01:45:35,416
He even established a special committee
to validate that title.

1411
01:45:36,750 --> 01:45:39,041
I may not have been close with my father,

1412
01:45:39,125 --> 01:45:42,250
but then I found out that for him,

1413
01:45:42,333 --> 01:45:47,500
beauty is not always about appearances,
and not something that can be measured.

1414
01:45:47,583 --> 01:45:51,666
Beauty can’t be measured
with numbers or graphics.

1415
01:45:52,500 --> 01:45:54,666
Especially when we're talking about love.

1416
01:45:55,250 --> 01:45:59,000
So, if something can still be measured
and assessed by numbers,

1417
01:45:59,083 --> 01:46:00,416
then that’s not love.

1418
01:46:01,666 --> 01:46:06,541
Love can help us face
even the most difficult times.

1419
01:46:07,375 --> 01:46:09,000
It’s working! The fire is lit!

1420
01:46:10,291 --> 01:46:11,125
Whoa!

1421
01:46:12,333 --> 01:46:17,750
Love can also warm our hearts
in the midst of a cold situation.

1422
01:46:19,250 --> 01:46:24,458
Love enables us to rebuild a home
that may have been destroyed by a storm.

1423
01:46:26,291 --> 01:46:31,250
Love makes us feel calm,
even when we feel empty.

1424
01:46:32,833 --> 01:46:35,083
For the past six months,
I have learned so much…

1425
01:46:37,416 --> 01:46:40,791
about the true meaning
of the most beautiful girl in the world.

1426
01:46:41,875 --> 01:46:44,916
I’ve learned a lot about love.

1427
01:46:46,666 --> 01:46:49,125
The most beautiful girl in the world

1428
01:46:49,208 --> 01:46:51,375
is someone who loves you

1429
01:46:52,541 --> 01:46:53,833
and is loved by you.

1430
01:46:54,541 --> 01:46:57,250
You can understand each other,
appreciate each other.

1431
01:46:57,833 --> 01:46:59,666
And you can only feel those things.

1432
01:46:59,750 --> 01:47:03,166
And I think finding a love like that
is everyone's dream.

1433
01:47:04,666 --> 01:47:08,583
A dream that is always spoken
in our prayers.

1434
01:47:14,833 --> 01:47:18,458
Maybe now is the right time
for me to make my dream come true.

1435
01:47:20,958 --> 01:47:22,375
Kiara, will you marry me?

1436
01:47:38,666 --> 01:47:39,583
I’m sorry, sir.

1437
01:47:43,208 --> 01:47:45,666
I can’t be a part of your TV show.

1438
01:47:48,125 --> 01:47:49,083
Kiara.

1439
01:47:55,083 --> 01:47:56,125
Kiara.

1440
01:47:56,708 --> 01:47:57,708
Kiara, wait.

1441
01:48:02,375 --> 01:48:04,166
Kiara, just hear me out. Wait!

1442
01:48:04,958 --> 01:48:06,083
Can’t I talk to you?

1443
01:48:06,583 --> 01:48:07,583
Hey!

1444
01:48:07,666 --> 01:48:08,791
-Hold on.
-What is it?

1445
01:48:08,875 --> 01:48:09,708
I want to talk.

1446
01:48:10,208 --> 01:48:13,083
You asked me what I want,
and now I have the answer.

1447
01:48:13,166 --> 01:48:15,291
I want you. I want to be with you.

1448
01:48:17,541 --> 01:48:18,375
Please.

1449
01:48:19,750 --> 01:48:20,791
I love you.

1450
01:48:26,166 --> 01:48:29,291
Ben, you don't know me well enough
to talk about love.

1451
01:48:30,791 --> 01:48:33,666
And you asked me to marry you?
It's not that simple.

1452
01:48:34,708 --> 01:48:35,958
Tell me right now.

1453
01:48:39,250 --> 01:48:41,458
Tell me that you don’t want to be with me.

1454
01:48:43,958 --> 01:48:47,708
Tell me that you don’t have
any feelings for me, at all.

1455
01:48:49,166 --> 01:48:51,416
Ben, marriage is a big deal.

1456
01:48:53,208 --> 01:48:55,291
You can’t just know someone for two weeks,

1457
01:48:55,375 --> 01:48:57,583
then say "I love you"
and ask them to marry you.

1458
01:48:57,666 --> 01:49:00,166
You think this is your reality show?
This is real life!

1459
01:49:04,708 --> 01:49:07,958
You want to marry me
because you have to get married, right?

1460
01:49:09,291 --> 01:49:10,666
I don’t want to lose you.

1461
01:49:13,958 --> 01:49:15,666
You don’t want to lose me…

1462
01:49:19,208 --> 01:49:21,208
or you don’t want to lose
your inheritance?

1463
01:49:28,083 --> 01:49:29,166
I'm sorry, but…

1464
01:49:32,791 --> 01:49:34,125
I'm not your way out.

1465
01:49:58,125 --> 01:50:01,166
SIX MONTHS LATER

1466
01:50:07,166 --> 01:50:12,291
So, with the two million
in series A's fundraising,

1467
01:50:12,791 --> 01:50:15,208
we will give 20% of our shares.

1468
01:50:16,625 --> 01:50:18,875
So, that’s it.

1469
01:50:19,541 --> 01:50:20,500
Interesting.

1470
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,375
Your start-up company is very interesting.

1471
01:50:23,458 --> 01:50:28,083
An optimistic media
about positivity in Indonesia.

1472
01:50:28,833 --> 01:50:31,166
Ben, I love your spirit.

1473
01:50:31,750 --> 01:50:32,583
Thank you, sir.

1474
01:50:32,666 --> 01:50:35,250
Give me a week,
and I’ll give you an answer.

1475
01:50:35,333 --> 01:50:37,833
Okay, I will gladly wait.

1476
01:50:37,916 --> 01:50:38,750
Thank you.

1477
01:50:39,333 --> 01:50:41,166
-Thank you so much.
-By the way,

1478
01:50:41,666 --> 01:50:44,958
your former employee who joined us
is a real asset.

1479
01:50:47,083 --> 01:50:47,916
Who is it?

1480
01:50:49,083 --> 01:50:52,125
I humbly apologize once again,

1481
01:50:52,666 --> 01:50:54,625
especially to Helen Kusuma,

1482
01:50:54,708 --> 01:50:57,791
for the mistake I have made
due to lack of consideration.

1483
01:50:57,875 --> 01:51:00,458
Also, this has no connection to WinTV.

1484
01:51:00,541 --> 01:51:01,791
This is purely my fault.

1485
01:51:01,875 --> 01:51:06,416
I believe Helen deserves to find happiness
with the right person.

1486
01:51:07,750 --> 01:51:09,166
I apologize once again.

1487
01:51:10,375 --> 01:51:11,291
I'm sorry.

1488
01:51:11,791 --> 01:51:13,125
Hello, Miss Producer.

1489
01:51:13,833 --> 01:51:14,666
Hi!

1490
01:51:15,333 --> 01:51:18,291
Oh, hey! My gosh! How are you?

1491
01:51:18,791 --> 01:51:20,250
-I’m good.
-Gosh.

1492
01:51:20,333 --> 01:51:22,125
I'm sorry I missed your pitch earlier.

1493
01:51:22,208 --> 01:51:23,250
No worries.

1494
01:51:23,916 --> 01:51:25,791
Oh, you look great!

1495
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:27,625
Beautiful.

1496
01:51:27,708 --> 01:51:29,416
Thank you, and you also look…

1497
01:51:32,291 --> 01:51:33,125
not bad.

1498
01:51:33,208 --> 01:51:34,458
-Not bad?
-Not bad.

1499
01:51:34,541 --> 01:51:36,500
-Not too bad.
-Not too bad.

1500
01:51:36,583 --> 01:51:39,375
By the way,
I heard the recent news about you.

1501
01:51:39,958 --> 01:51:44,500
You didn’t claim your inheritance,
and built your own company instead.

1502
01:51:44,583 --> 01:51:45,625
It’s been a while.

1503
01:51:45,708 --> 01:51:46,833
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

1504
01:51:46,916 --> 01:51:48,791
I'm just catching up now.

1505
01:51:49,833 --> 01:51:52,583
But I’m sure Mr. Gunadi must be proud.

1506
01:51:56,208 --> 01:52:01,208
And I respect you
for apologizing to Helen in public.

1507
01:52:01,916 --> 01:52:04,708
In the history of Indonesian television,

1508
01:52:04,791 --> 01:52:08,791
I think no one has ever apologized
in public. Almost no one, right?

1509
01:52:08,875 --> 01:52:11,583
-Maybe.
-Maybe, but it’s rare.

1510
01:52:12,125 --> 01:52:14,208
Yes, but it has happened before.

1511
01:52:22,833 --> 01:52:24,125
Dinner, tonight?

1512
01:52:25,125 --> 01:52:26,583
-Tonight?
-Yup.

1513
01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:32,916
I can't do it today.

1514
01:52:35,041 --> 01:52:35,958
Okay.

1515
01:52:38,625 --> 01:52:40,166
-Tomorrow?
-Tomorrow, yes.

1516
01:52:41,083 --> 01:52:42,208
Okay. At 7:00 p.m.?

1517
01:52:43,250 --> 01:52:44,166
-Seven is okay.
-Yup.

1518
01:52:48,416 --> 01:52:49,375
Good to see you.

1519
01:52:52,250 --> 01:52:53,291
Good to see you too.

1520
01:52:53,375 --> 01:52:55,916
I’m happy to see you, Miss Producer.

1521
01:52:58,875 --> 01:52:59,708
See you.

1522
01:53:00,375 --> 01:53:01,208
See you.

1523
01:53:04,625 --> 01:53:08,791
SEAFOOD IDOLA 88

1524
01:53:11,416 --> 01:53:12,916
Excuse me, sir.

1525
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:14,500
- Thank you.
- Alright, sir.

1526
01:53:14,583 --> 01:53:15,833
We’re already hungry.

1527
01:53:17,208 --> 01:53:18,708
-Perfect timing.
-Yup.

1528
01:53:19,916 --> 01:53:20,791
Sir?

1529
01:53:25,208 --> 01:53:26,083
Ta-da!

1530
01:53:28,250 --> 01:53:29,166
So…

1531
01:53:31,416 --> 01:53:32,708
what’s your plan now?

1532
01:53:34,125 --> 01:53:36,125
If we're talking about plans,

1533
01:53:36,208 --> 01:53:41,833
I definitely want to try
to build my company properly.

1534
01:53:41,916 --> 01:53:45,125
I don’t know
what the future holds, but we'll see.

1535
01:53:49,625 --> 01:53:50,666
But here’s the thing.

1536
01:53:50,750 --> 01:53:52,625
Okay, that’s a plan.

1537
01:53:52,708 --> 01:53:54,416
But I want to talk about dreams.

1538
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:55,833
Okay.

1539
01:53:55,916 --> 01:53:59,708
Have you fulfilled your dream
of buying an apartment?

1540
01:54:00,583 --> 01:54:01,416
Sorry.

1541
01:54:03,291 --> 01:54:05,625
-I have.
-Oh! That's good!

1542
01:54:06,833 --> 01:54:07,708
With a mortgage.

1543
01:54:07,791 --> 01:54:09,083
That’s fine. It’s a start.

1544
01:54:09,166 --> 01:54:11,083
With a very long mortgage period.

1545
01:54:11,166 --> 01:54:12,208
It’s okay.

1546
01:54:13,041 --> 01:54:15,166
I’m proud. I’m happy.

1547
01:54:16,291 --> 01:54:18,583
-Yeah?
-Yeah, really. I'm happy to hear that.

1548
01:54:19,958 --> 01:54:20,875
Thank you.

1549
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:23,541
You worked hard for that.

1550
01:54:25,541 --> 01:54:26,375
Incredible.

1551
01:54:27,666 --> 01:54:29,791
Do you often visit WinTV?

1552
01:54:29,875 --> 01:54:32,166
Not really. Once in a while. Sometimes.

1553
01:54:32,250 --> 01:54:34,375
But I’m spending
more time with my mom now.

1554
01:54:35,333 --> 01:54:36,291
-Really?
-Yeah.

1555
01:54:38,208 --> 01:54:44,333
We often hang out together and talk.

1556
01:54:45,041 --> 01:54:47,500
I feel really happy, and so is she.

1557
01:54:51,375 --> 01:54:52,416
Happy to hear that.

1558
01:54:55,666 --> 01:54:56,500
Thank you.

1559
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:03,041
So, have you tried this fish?

1560
01:55:03,125 --> 01:55:04,958
-Okay, let me try it.
-Okay.

1561
01:55:10,500 --> 01:55:11,500
Try the fish.

1562
01:55:17,583 --> 01:55:18,416
Well?

1563
01:55:22,125 --> 01:55:24,125
-How is it?
-Delicious.

1564
01:55:24,208 --> 01:55:26,583
Yeah, right? I told you so.

1565
01:55:26,666 --> 01:55:30,166
Compared to the grilled fish
from your favorite French restaurant,

1566
01:55:30,250 --> 01:55:31,958
which one is better?

1567
01:55:33,375 --> 01:55:35,916
This is better.
Maybe because I'm eating it with you.

1568
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,500
Wow, that's so cheesy!

1569
01:55:42,791 --> 01:55:44,875
Did you know,
I almost got lost when I parked?

1570
01:55:44,958 --> 01:55:46,625
-Bullshit! Seriously?
-I did!

1571
01:55:46,708 --> 01:55:49,250
I've never eaten here.
Didn't know where to park.

1572
01:55:49,333 --> 01:55:51,708
-There's plenty of parking space.
-I got confused.

1573
01:55:55,750 --> 01:55:56,875
-Kiara.
-Yes?

1574
01:56:01,041 --> 01:56:02,666
Do you know that I love

1575
01:56:02,750 --> 01:56:05,416
hearing you laugh and seeing your smile?

1576
01:56:09,333 --> 01:56:10,375
And…

1577
01:56:15,541 --> 01:56:18,333
I want to be the reason
you smile every day.

1578
01:56:34,250 --> 01:56:35,375
That's all for now.

1579
01:56:37,083 --> 01:56:39,416
-That's all for now?
-Uh-huh. That's all for now.

1580
01:56:42,458 --> 01:56:45,625
So, if I want to hold your hand right now,
is that not allowed?

1581
01:56:46,958 --> 01:56:47,791
That's okay.

1582
01:56:48,625 --> 01:56:50,291
It's okay if I hold your hand.

1583
01:56:51,083 --> 01:56:54,083
You always have to have the last word
and take the initiative, huh?

1584
01:56:54,583 --> 01:56:57,875
Hey! If I hadn't taken the initiative,
we would have died on that island.

1585
01:56:58,500 --> 01:56:59,541
Yeah, you're right.

1586

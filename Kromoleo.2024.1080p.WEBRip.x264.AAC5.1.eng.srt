3
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:19,166
In the '80s, many tattooed thugs
were mysteriously murdered,

4
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,625
and shocked the country.

5
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:25,083
The thugs were scattered in many places,
and came from many circles,

6
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:27,625
both organized and unorganized.

7
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:30,750
The organized ones
are commonly known as "Sugali,"

8
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:32,666
which comes from the word "Gali,"

9
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,791
which stands for "Gabungan Anak Liar,"
or "Wild Kids Society."

10
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:38,458
It is said that some Sugalis
cannot be killed

11
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:44,041
either by bullets or sharp weapons.

12
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:46,250
CENTRAL JAVA, 1984

13
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:13,708
That's enough.

14
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:18,333
Get out.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I said get out!

16
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:28,583
Okay.

17
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:32,166
Dump them inside.

18
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:01,166
Anyone else?

19
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:03,708
I said, "Anyone else?"

20
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:41,041
Thanks.

21
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,791
You won't get away with this.

22
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,833
You think you can use me?

23
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,625
Then dump me like a stray dog?

24
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:26,041
Don't overvalue yourself, Djarot.

25
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,583
You are lower than dog shit.

26
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,250
You too, Prapto.

27
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,791
You've really become his lackey.

28
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,041
You think he's going to appreciate you?

29
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:47,041
You're out of your mind, Djarot.

30
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:52,291
You were told to create chaos,
but you don't have to drink their blood!

31
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:58,458
I don't know if you're a human or what.

32
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,625
The time will come…

33
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:08,166
when you will know…

34
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,958
what I really am.

35
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:16,500
What do you think you will achieve
with your incantation?

36
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:21,000
I will make sure
that it will all be in vain tonight.

37
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,500
As long as my blood still flows,

38
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:28,708
and my body still treads
on the land of the village…

39
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,875
I will keep coming back.

40
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:39,875
You will all feel my wrath,
piece by piece…

41
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,583
body by body.

42
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,458
I will take all of you…

43
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:49,041
until there's nothing left.

44
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:53,875
Then I'll come for you, old man.

45
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:58,208
I will get my revenge.

46
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:05,375
I've read your ritual book.

47
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:08,875
The yellow book…

48
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:11,541
right?

49
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:19,916
Maybe you can only be stopped
by your flesh and blood,

50
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,833
but I have another way.

51
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:24,750
Yanto.

52
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:37,250
As long as my blood still flows

53
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:41,000
on this earth,

54
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,375
you will face your doom.

55
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,708
This ends tonight!

56

10 YEARS LATER

74
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,875
Are you sure this is a good idea, Zi?

75
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,416
We can still go back to Jakarta
if you change your mind.

76
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,333
I only have one mother, Dik…

77
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,500
and she died.

78
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,875
If they think
I won't come to her funeral…

79
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:11,125
and think of it as if nothing happened,
then they're wrong.

80
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,291
I still remember…

81
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,125
There were a time
when my mother was good to me,

82
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:28,041
but there were times
when people would see me as trash.

83
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,125
I'm just an illegitimate child.

84
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:37,416
Hey, you're not
an illegitimate child, Zia,

85
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,000
and there's no such thing as that.

86
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,000
I just don't understand.

87
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,375
There are too many secrets
about my father.

88
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,375
Is he really that bad of a person?

89
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:15,583
WELCOME TO MAJENANG VILLAGE

90
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:41,500
- Sir, can we pull over ahead?
- Yes.

91
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,875
Grandpa?

92
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,250
Grandpa?

93
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:56,500
Grandpa?

94
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:03,125
I already said you didn't need to come.

95
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:06,083
My mother died, Grandpa.
Why shouldn't I be here?

96
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,500
The funeral is done…

97
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,708
so, you can go back now.

98
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,250
Now you're going to hate me too?

99
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,291
I can't be here even for a day?

100
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,750
No one hates you.
It's completely the other way.

101
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,458
What is he doing here? Is it necessary?

102
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:29,916
Yes, it is.

103
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:32,333
Grandpa?

104
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,500
I thought I could help you here,
especially now that you're alone.

105
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,750
- I am used to being alone.
- Grandpa, I'm serious, Grandpa.

106
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,583
It's not safe here, Zia.

107
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:44,291
- Why isn't it safe for me here?
- You know why!

108
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,583
Is it still because of my dad? Grandpa…

109
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:52,916
he's been gone for ten years,
can't the people here forget about it?

110
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,416
Time moves differently here.
You are well aware of that.

111
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:09,791
Ladies and gentlemen…

112
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,166
I've gathered everyone here…

113
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:21,083
because of an incident that
should not have happened in our village.

114
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,625
- What incident?
- What incident?

115
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:24,666
Earlier…

116
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,500
Mrs. Ida's daughter came to the funeral.

117
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:34,125
- Oh, God.
- You all know what I mean, right?

118
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:38,958
And for you kids,
you've definitely heard of the stories.

119
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,875
But now, more importantly…

120
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:49,208
I'm asking you all
to not leave your houses tonight.

121
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,208
What if we want to pray?

122
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:58,291
If you want to pray, then pray at home.
Just pray at home!

123
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:00,916
Do you understand?

124
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:08,208
Stay away from windows,
and keep them shut.

125
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:09,958
If you have curtains, keep them closed.

126
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:13,333
If someone knocks on your door,
do not open it!

127
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:19,708
Those who have children,
don't let them out of your sight.

128
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:25,625
And for those who are unlucky enough
to meet "them" in person,

129
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:31,583
do not ever look
straight into their eyes. Understood?

130
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:35,000
What happens
if we look directly into their eyes?

131
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,416
He will come for you…

132
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,541
to take your life.

133
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,458
Mom's favorite dress.

134
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,291
Zia?

135
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,125
What is this thing?

136
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,125
Zia!

137
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:49,666
- Have you packed your things?
- Not yet.

138
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:55,000
You don't have much time.
I will take you to town.

139
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:59,666
- What's this, Grandpa?
- Forget it. That's not important.

140
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,333
These are my personal belongings.
Come on, hurry up!

141
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:11,291
Why is he in a hurry to kick us out?
We just got here, Zi.

142
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,750
He's worried about the villagers.

143
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,208
Worried about what?

144
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,083
Because they don't like my father.

145
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:25,500
Grandpa said
my father owed a lot of debts here,

146
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,500
… and he just disappeared.

147
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,458
What does it have to do
with you being here?

148
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:33,916
Because they are afraid
that my father would appear again.

149
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,708
I also can't meet him.

150
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,166
What if he comes back…

151
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:50,250
Well, you said that he left his family,
maybe your father…

152
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,041
I don't think he ran away, Dik.

153
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,500
He really loves me.

154
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,875
I'm actually suspicious
about his disappearance.

155
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,958
When I heard
my mother and grandpa's conversation

156
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,250
on the phone last year…

157
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,958
she wanted me to come home
for just one day,

158
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:10,916
because my best friend
was getting married,

159
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,500
but Grandpa wouldn't allow it.

160
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,250
He said if I came here…

161
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,041
it would cause fatal consequences.

162
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,458
I actually feel like…

163
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:24,833
my father wants to come back…

164
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,458
but Grandpa won't allow it.

165
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,541
So, what do you do now?

166
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,208
I'm sorry…

167
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,125
for dragging you into this.

168
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,041
This must be Yanto's doing.

169
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,500
Come on, pick up.

170
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,166
You, come with me.

171
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,333
- Me, sir?
- Yes.

172
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,833
- What about me?
- Stay here.

173
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:11,625
- If anyone comes, you hide.
- What exactly is your plan?

174
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,583
I'm trying to find a way to save you.

175
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,250
Let's go!

176
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,208
Grandpa! Grandpa!

177
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:25,750
Grandpa!
Why can't I just stay here for a day?

178
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:30,000
- Just until the tire gets fixed, Grandpa.
- Because it's dangerous, Zia.

179
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:35,333
I know this is hard for you to understand,
but you need to trust me.

180
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:37,291
Please.

181
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,458
You don't need to be here. Let's go.

182
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:56,375
You, look for help over there.

183
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:00,375
- Tell them we need help.
- Is it far, sir?

184
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,250
If you keep asking,
we'll never get close!

185
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,500
- Go!
- Yes, Boss.

186
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,416
The road has not been repaired
by the village chief.

187
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,250
Do you think we should go back?

188
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:21,333
Just relax.
If there's danger, I'm not afraid.

189
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:25,250
- I lift weights every day.
- Whatever.

190
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:29,833
By the way,
no one actually left their house.

191
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,291
It's like a dead village.

192
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:36,083
People are stupid
for listening to the chief.

193
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:38,083
Nobody is bringing a curse here.

194
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:42,375
Meli!

195
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:45,583
Meli!

196
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:47,416
- Yes, Mom?
- The phone.

197
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,750
- Hello.
- It's me, Zia.

198
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:58,083
- Zia?
- Sorry, Mel.

199
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:00,708
I can't come to your wedding.

200
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:06,333
- You know how my grandpa is.
- It's okay.

201
00:23:06,416 --> 00:23:09,833
<i>- I'm sorry about your mother.</i>
- Thanks, Mel.

202
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:00,791
What?

203
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:17,166
Sir? Sir? Hello? Sir?

204
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:08,458
Hey! Go back to your home!

205
00:25:20,791 --> 00:25:22,000
Shit.

206
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:25,000
- I'm out of here, Bud.
- It's just a blackout, Jon.

207
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,916
Jon?

208
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:35,541
Jon?

209
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,833
Damn it, he left.

210
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:44,458
Jon?

211
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:02,708
Mom? What's going on?

212
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:07,500
- Mom?
- Get inside! Do not come out!

213
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:41,791
- What are you doing?
- I surrender! I surrender!

214
00:26:44,958 --> 00:26:45,833
Zia?

215
00:26:47,333 --> 00:26:49,625
What's taking you so long?
Where's Grandpa?

216
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:50,583
I thought…

217
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:55,208
- We have to get out of here now, Zia.
- What are you doing?

218
00:26:55,291 --> 00:26:56,875
He must've brainwashed you, didn't he?

219
00:26:56,958 --> 00:26:59,708
I'm serious, Zi. We have to go.
There's something wrong here.

220
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:02,416
- What is it?
- I saw a group of strange people.

221
00:27:03,416 --> 00:27:05,583
- They carried a corpse, Zi.
- What corpse?

222
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:07,083
They're strange, Zi.

223
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:11,375
- Did you see a ghost?
- I'm not kidding. I'm serious.

224
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:13,916
You shouldn't have sabotaged
the truck's tire, Zi.

225
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:28,416
- I just need to know, Dik.
- No.

226
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,458
We have to go home. I want to go home!

227
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:32,541
- Dika!
- I want to go home!

228
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:33,500
Stop!

229
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:46,416
- Jon, where are you?
- Bud?

230
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,375
I thought those things
kidnapped you.

231
00:27:49,458 --> 00:27:52,416
You ran away
when your friend was in trouble.

232
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,000
- You idiot!
- You're an idiot for not believing me.

233
00:28:23,458 --> 00:28:24,625
Please help.

234
00:28:25,708 --> 00:28:27,875
Please don't hurt me.

235
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:30,583
Let's tell everyone.

236
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,666
Jon?

237
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:35,541
- Help me, Jon!
- Bud?

238
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:37,375
- Bud?
- Jon.

239
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:41,250
Bud? Bud?

240
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:43,958
Bud, say God's name, Bud!

241
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:47,125
- Help me, Jon.
- Bud!

242
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:48,208
Jon!

243
00:28:52,166 --> 00:28:54,208
Jon! Jon!

244
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:57,125
- Bud?
- Jon!

245
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,000
GUARD POST
MAJENANG VILLAGE

246
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:58,791
- I want to go home, Zia!
- Stop!

247
00:30:02,958 --> 00:30:05,750
Dika! Dika! Dika!

248
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,541
Dika! Dika!

249
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:12,958
- Run!
- Come on, let's go, Dika!

250
00:30:19,416 --> 00:30:20,875
Wait for me.

251
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,916
Wait for me.

252
00:30:25,208 --> 00:30:26,625
Wait a bit.

253
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:31,208
- Grandpa, what was that?
- You shouldn't be here!

254
00:30:31,291 --> 00:30:34,916
- What was that? Explain it to me!
- You've seen them, right?

255
00:30:35,791 --> 00:30:38,291
- Who are they?
- A group of pallbearers!

256
00:30:39,708 --> 00:30:42,541
I've seen them, sir.
A group of the demon pallbearers.

257
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,125
"Pallbearer"?

258
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:47,500
We should go there now. There's no time.
We have to get help. Come on!

259
00:30:47,583 --> 00:30:48,458
Grandpa!

260
00:30:50,208 --> 00:30:53,541
Grandpa!
Let's take a short break, Grandpa.

261
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:54,750
We can't do that, Zia!

262
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:58,125
We've walked far.
They won't follow us, Grandpa.

263
00:30:58,208 --> 00:30:59,958
You're not safe
as long as you're in the village.

264
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:03,583
Grandpa! It's time you told me.
What actually happened here?

265
00:31:03,666 --> 00:31:05,375
I know that you know the truth.

266
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:07,291
Tell me!

267
00:31:09,916 --> 00:31:12,541
- Sir? That's them, sir.
- Hold this for me.

268
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,625
Come on. Run!

269
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:37,958
Dika! Grandpa! Dika!

270
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:40,000
Grandpa!

271
00:31:41,208 --> 00:31:42,083
Ah!

272
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,583
Grandpa! Grandpa!

273
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,333
- Run!
- Come on!

274
00:31:49,416 --> 00:31:52,166
- Wait, Grandpa!
- Run!

275
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:56,333
Grandpa! Grandpa!

276
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,500
- Dika!
- Come on, Zi!

277
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:59,791
- Grandpa!
- Come on, Zi! Come on!

278
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:00,750
No, Dika!

279
00:32:03,916 --> 00:32:07,666
Zi? Come on, Zi.
We can't go back. Come on!

280
00:32:08,208 --> 00:32:10,000
My grandpa is there, Dik.
We have to help him. Please.

281
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:13,750
How? We don't even know
what that thing was.

282
00:32:13,833 --> 00:32:17,625
- We're going to die too!
- He's the only family I have, Dik. Please!

283
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:19,250
Zi!

284
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,625
If anyone can survive now,
it's your grandpa, Zi!

285
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:25,791
You know that.

286
00:32:27,291 --> 00:32:29,250
Now, we have to look for a house
with a phone.

287
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:32,666
We ask for help, just like he planned,
and then we look for him.

288
00:32:33,166 --> 00:32:34,041
Come on, Zia.

289
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:37,250
Zi, come on.

290
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:42,416
Come on.

291
00:32:48,291 --> 00:32:49,416
Come on.

292
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,375
- Meli.
- Meli?

293
00:32:52,875 --> 00:32:55,583
- Meli's house.
- Who is Meli, Zi?

294
00:32:56,416 --> 00:32:57,458
My childhood friend.

295
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:01,291
Let's go. Let's go.

296
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:11,083
Let's go.

297
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,125
Mel?

298
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:37,750
Meli?

299
00:34:07,875 --> 00:34:10,125
Dika! Dika! Dika!

300
00:34:21,041 --> 00:34:22,250
Help!

301
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:24,916
- Meli?
- Help.

302
00:34:26,083 --> 00:34:27,791
- Meli!
- Zia!

303
00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:30,000
Meli!

304
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,875
Are you okay?

305
00:34:34,041 --> 00:34:36,291
Kromoleo, Zi…

306
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:38,250
What's that, Mel?

307
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:45,333
Mother…

308
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:54,541
Say God's name, Mel.

309
00:34:59,625 --> 00:35:00,500
Zi.

310
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:04,000
- We have to get out of here.
- Yeah, but how, Dika?

311
00:35:04,083 --> 00:35:06,750
I don't know,
but we have to get out of here!

312
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,333
Car. Zia, there's a car!

313
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:21,958
Sir! Sir!

314
00:35:22,875 --> 00:35:24,833
- Sir, stop, sir! Sir, over here, sir!
- Sir!

315
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:26,416
- Sir!
- Sir!

316
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,583
Sir, over here, sir! Please help us, sir!

317
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,375
Dika!

318
00:35:40,958 --> 00:35:41,833
Dika!

319
00:35:43,625 --> 00:35:46,916
Get up.
Help me get him up. Come on, Dika!

320
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:52,083
Ah!

321
00:35:52,166 --> 00:35:54,500
Just a little further, Dika.

322
00:35:59,333 --> 00:36:00,250
Dika.

323
00:36:04,916 --> 00:36:08,916
- You have to survive, Zi.
- No, Dika.

324
00:36:09,416 --> 00:36:11,250
I've seen them too, Dik.

325
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:13,916
I saw them, Dik!

326
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:19,250
Zia? I love you, Zi.

327
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:30,416
Dika? Dika! Dika!

328
00:36:33,208 --> 00:36:36,291
Dika! Dika! Dika!

329
00:36:42,291 --> 00:36:48,375
Dika. Dika! Dika! Dika! Dika!

330
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:52,208
- He's gone, Zia. Leave him be.
- Dika! Dika! Dika! Dika!

331
00:36:52,291 --> 00:36:59,125
Zia. That's enough, Zia. Zia.

332
00:36:59,208 --> 00:37:03,291
Zia! Zia, please wake up!

333
00:37:14,583 --> 00:37:15,500
Prapto.

334
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:20,250
- Honey?
- Prapto.

335
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:23,208
It's Mr. Danang. Wait here.
Coming, Mr. Danang.

336
00:38:05,541 --> 00:38:08,083
Where's the amulet?
You have to come with me.

337
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:09,041
Honey?

338
00:38:11,541 --> 00:38:16,375
- I can't leave my wife alone at home.
- Then give me the amulet.

339
00:38:31,875 --> 00:38:37,625
I've been waiting for you for years.

340
00:38:40,625 --> 00:38:41,625
Who are you?

341
00:38:46,333 --> 00:38:47,333
Where am I?

342
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:58,916
Meli? Meli?
Where is Meli? Meli? Mel!

343
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:01,458
Meli! Meli!

344
00:39:17,208 --> 00:39:18,375
Kromoleo.

345
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:23,333
Everyone who died tonight…

346
00:39:24,833 --> 00:39:26,541
is because of Kromoleo.

347
00:39:31,791 --> 00:39:36,958
Give me the amulet, Prapto.
This situation is beyond our control.

348
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,708
If this is not resolved,
many more victims will fall.

349
00:39:39,791 --> 00:39:43,583
Why don't you just take her away
from our village, sir?

350
00:39:43,666 --> 00:39:48,208
Someone slashed my tires!
It's too late to find help!

351
00:39:48,291 --> 00:39:50,625
Djarot is back too.
There will be a lot of victims.

352
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:52,708
Come on, where is the amulet? Hurry up!

353
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,416
This…

354
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:07,041
this is what has kept you safe
all this time.

355
00:40:09,083 --> 00:40:10,583
Safe from what?

356
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
The curse.

357
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:18,708
Your father's curse.

358
00:40:22,125 --> 00:40:23,125
Give it to me.

359
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:30,000
So, what are your plans?
Are you going to revive him again?

360
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:33,166
Yes! I will ask Zia to kill her father.

361
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:36,166
Where are the salt bullets
that I gave you?

362
00:40:36,708 --> 00:40:37,625
All right.

363
00:40:37,708 --> 00:40:38,833
Just a moment, sir.

364
00:40:45,958 --> 00:40:46,833
Here you go.

365
00:40:49,375 --> 00:40:52,041
I will look for Zia. Hope she's safe.

366
00:40:52,916 --> 00:40:54,958
- Close the door tightly.
- Okay.

367
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,375
Wait here.

368
00:41:07,291 --> 00:41:10,708
Your father…

369
00:41:15,208 --> 00:41:18,875
was beheaded by your grandfather.

370
00:41:23,625 --> 00:41:26,541
But your father is one tough bastard.

371
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,791
He can't just die…

372
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,875
because he uses black magic.

373
00:41:52,375 --> 00:41:53,875
Rawarontek.

374
00:41:55,291 --> 00:41:59,416
As long as my flesh and blood
is still treading this land…

375
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:04,208
as long as my blood still flows
on this earth,

376
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,750
you will face your doom.

377
00:42:09,916 --> 00:42:14,708
You will know the true meaning of fear.

378
00:42:21,916 --> 00:42:26,416
And as soon as you step foot
in this village…

379
00:42:28,708 --> 00:42:31,166
the Gali thugs arise from their grave…

380
00:42:32,791 --> 00:42:34,875
in the form of Kromoleo.

381
00:42:37,291 --> 00:42:39,041
And anyone who sees them…

382
00:42:43,916 --> 00:42:44,833
will die.

383
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,875
Murdered…

384
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:49,125
by your father.

385
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:52,791
Why did you give him the amulet?

386
00:42:52,875 --> 00:42:56,500
You know the risk,
our family will pay the price.

387
00:42:56,583 --> 00:43:00,083
- So, what now?
- You know who he is, right?

388
00:43:01,958 --> 00:43:05,791
You just can't say no
to people like Danang.

389
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:08,125
The curse is coming to us.

390
00:43:09,166 --> 00:43:11,208
He will kill us!

391
00:43:12,125 --> 00:43:14,958
So, who's scarier now?
That demon or Danang?

392
00:43:15,041 --> 00:43:16,416
Enough, enough, enough!

393
00:43:17,416 --> 00:43:18,583
Just calm down.

394
00:43:19,708 --> 00:43:20,583
Whatever you say.

395
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:23,541
Prapto.

396
00:43:26,166 --> 00:43:28,041
- Open the door.
- Honey?

397
00:43:59,416 --> 00:44:01,166
So, my father is not dead yet?

398
00:44:06,041 --> 00:44:08,000
Nobody could kill him…

399
00:44:18,333 --> 00:44:20,833
except by his own flesh and blood.

400
00:44:30,541 --> 00:44:35,208
Danang beheaded your father,

401
00:44:35,958 --> 00:44:38,416
and buried his head
separately from his body.

402
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:43,625
Only he knows where Djarot's grave is.

403
00:44:46,916 --> 00:44:48,250
But it's all in vain…

404
00:44:50,083 --> 00:44:56,708
because the curse of Kromoleo
has been declared.

405
00:45:17,208 --> 00:45:18,958
How can I stop it?

406
00:45:34,416 --> 00:45:35,291
Honey?

407
00:45:40,458 --> 00:45:42,750
Djarot!

408
00:45:46,125 --> 00:45:49,375
You must revive your father's corpse.

409
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:54,250
Djarot! Bastard!

410
00:46:12,041 --> 00:46:14,041
Join his body with his head…

411
00:46:19,291 --> 00:46:23,708
and stab him with a sharp object
stained with your blood.

412
00:46:25,541 --> 00:46:27,166
Then he will die.

413
00:46:39,625 --> 00:46:41,916
That's your grandfather's plan…

414
00:46:43,708 --> 00:46:47,458
using you to stop your own father.

415
00:46:57,583 --> 00:46:58,541
<i>It's impossible.</i>

416
00:47:00,583 --> 00:47:02,208
Grandpa is not a bad person.

417
00:47:04,541 --> 00:47:09,666
You don't know who Danang really is.
You don't know your own grandfather!

418
00:47:10,916 --> 00:47:12,875
What happened to your father…

419
00:47:14,208 --> 00:47:17,958
is because your grandfather ordered
those Gali thugs to cause chaos.

420
00:47:18,041 --> 00:47:20,458
<i>If necessary, wreak havoc!</i>

421
00:47:21,333 --> 00:47:22,625
All this time…

422
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:28,041
you all have been safe
because of this amulet.

423
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:37,375
This amulet is made
from your father's tooth.

424
00:47:41,875 --> 00:47:43,541
Danang?

425
00:47:44,583 --> 00:47:50,666
He is a real bastard.
He's the scum of the earth!

426
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:53,333
He prepared this amulet for you…

427
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,791
Prapto, and himself…

428
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:01,000
while everyone else was left to die!

429
00:48:02,375 --> 00:48:04,625
I saw it myself,

430
00:48:04,708 --> 00:48:09,708
then I had to blind myself
so that I would never see Kromoleo!

431
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,791
Let me go, sir.

432
00:48:19,541 --> 00:48:20,583
Let me go.

433
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:27,250
If you say I can stop all of this,
I will do it.

434
00:48:29,875 --> 00:48:31,583
Even though my dad is a demon…

435
00:48:36,708 --> 00:48:38,500
<i>he was a good father to me.</i>

436
00:48:48,041 --> 00:48:49,791
He will listen to me, sir.

437
00:48:57,833 --> 00:49:04,500
Who said that I want to stop this?

438
00:49:07,833 --> 00:49:08,833
Zia…

439
00:49:11,083 --> 00:49:15,333
this village is nothing
but a colony of evil human beings!

440
00:49:17,083 --> 00:49:18,791
Including me.

441
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:23,041
They all went silent

442
00:49:23,125 --> 00:49:26,750
when those thugs were massacred
like a bunch of animals!

443
00:49:27,958 --> 00:49:30,125
It all ends here!

444
00:49:32,666 --> 00:49:35,041
I'm tired of hiding.

445
00:49:38,125 --> 00:49:41,208
I want this whole village to die,

446
00:49:41,291 --> 00:49:43,875
to face the consequences
of their own actions!

447
00:49:47,083 --> 00:49:49,291
Let the curse be fulfilled…

448
00:49:50,958 --> 00:49:54,041
and there will be no need
for any more victims.

449
00:49:56,166 --> 00:49:57,375
For doing that…

450
00:50:00,583 --> 00:50:01,875
I apologize.

451
00:50:06,291 --> 00:50:08,958
You have to die, Zia…

452
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:15,041
so that no one can stop the curse.

453
00:50:46,083 --> 00:50:46,958
Grandpa!

454
00:51:35,958 --> 00:51:38,958
Grandpa! That's enough!

455
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:46,458
I should've killed you
the first chance I got!

456
00:51:53,833 --> 00:51:54,708
Grandpa!

457
00:52:06,416 --> 00:52:07,333
Are you okay?

458
00:52:10,125 --> 00:52:11,000
Grandpa?

459
00:52:14,916 --> 00:52:16,125
Let's get out of here.

460
00:52:22,333 --> 00:52:23,208
Take that.

461
00:52:24,333 --> 00:52:25,208
Hurry.

462
00:52:35,625 --> 00:52:38,333
You're still alive
because of my granddaughter.

463
00:52:38,416 --> 00:52:41,666
Don't you dare try that again,
I won't hesitate!

464
00:52:42,666 --> 00:52:46,375
We will all die, Danang.

465
00:52:46,458 --> 00:52:49,833
We all deserve to die!

466
00:52:52,041 --> 00:52:52,916
Let's go!

467
00:53:25,458 --> 00:53:29,750
- Where are you taking me?
- Not far from here.

468
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:33,041
- The important thing is that you trust me!
- Trust you?

469
00:53:34,125 --> 00:53:36,500
There's no reason for me
to trust you anymore!

470
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:40,166
I know everything, Grandpa.
I already know!

471
00:53:43,208 --> 00:53:45,333
We're all under my father's curse…

472
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,125
all because of you!

473
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,125
You lied to me.

474
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,416
You told me he just left us for no reason.

475
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:59,125
It's good that you already know.

476
00:54:04,333 --> 00:54:05,791
What are you doing?

477
00:54:06,666 --> 00:54:11,083
We're going to revive Djarot's corpse,
and you will stab him with this knife!

478
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:17,875
You're such an evil man! A wicked man!

479
00:54:20,083 --> 00:54:21,750
My father might be a demon…

480
00:54:23,083 --> 00:54:24,833
but so are you!

481
00:54:24,916 --> 00:54:30,041
You can say whatever you want,
I still love you.

482
00:54:30,958 --> 00:54:35,875
As long as you can still live in peace,
I'm willing to be a demon for you.

483
00:54:36,833 --> 00:54:38,416
My dad was a good person.

484
00:54:40,208 --> 00:54:42,958
He loved me. He was kind to me, Grandpa.

485
00:54:44,541 --> 00:54:46,458
He disappeared ten years ago.

486
00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:51,500
Now, I have the opportunity
to meet him again, Grandpa.

487
00:54:51,583 --> 00:54:53,291
And you're asking me to stab him?

488
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:55,583
Zia…

489
00:54:56,625 --> 00:55:02,208
- Djarot is no longer human. He can't die!
- I believe in my father's love for me.

490
00:55:04,083 --> 00:55:05,208
He loves me.

491
00:55:06,625 --> 00:55:08,041
He won't hurt me.

492
00:55:08,916 --> 00:55:10,708
Just try it your way.

493
00:55:10,791 --> 00:55:13,083
The knife's already stained
with your blood.

494
00:55:13,166 --> 00:55:15,250
If you can't do it,
then I'll be the one who stabs Djarot!

495
00:55:15,333 --> 00:55:16,833
Then I will stop you!

496
00:55:16,916 --> 00:55:20,333
But to get to that point,
we must revive Djarot first.

497
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:29,125
Grandpa!

498
00:55:30,416 --> 00:55:32,250
Why are we going back home, Grandpa?

499
00:55:34,458 --> 00:55:35,333
Grandpa!

500
00:55:39,666 --> 00:55:42,541
Your father's grave is in the backyard.

501
00:55:43,583 --> 00:55:44,791
I buried him myself.

502
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:49,208
You don't feel guilty at all, do you?

503
00:55:51,583 --> 00:55:54,333
How many more victims will it take
for you to feel guilty?

504
00:55:54,416 --> 00:55:55,291
Answer me!

505
00:55:56,041 --> 00:55:58,958
All the villagers are still alive
because of me!

506
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:04,333
I was the one who saved them all
from those Gali thugs.

507
00:56:04,416 --> 00:56:07,333
You yourself are the one who ordered
those Gali thugs to create chaos!

508
00:56:09,375 --> 00:56:11,291
You don't understand, Zia.

509
00:56:11,375 --> 00:56:14,041
There's a reason for all of that!
A reason!

510
00:56:16,125 --> 00:56:17,583
I know everything, Grandpa.

511
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:23,375
It was your life decisions that brought
the curse on all of us, not my father's.

512
00:56:23,458 --> 00:56:25,875
The curse is back because of you!

513
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:30,791
Sending you to live in town
was the right decision for everyone here!

514
00:56:31,916 --> 00:56:36,125
But it wasn't enough!
You insisted on coming back here!

515
00:56:36,208 --> 00:56:38,541
You insisted, and you didn't listen to me!

516
00:56:40,791 --> 00:56:43,166
Now, the curse is back here.

517
00:56:44,875 --> 00:56:48,083
You never told me
why I couldn't come back here…

518
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,166
and meanwhile,
all my family was here, Grandpa.

519
00:56:55,458 --> 00:56:57,875
If I had known,
I would've never come back here, Grandpa!

520
00:56:57,958 --> 00:57:00,041
If it has already happened, so be it.

521
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:03,250
Maybe I was wrong.

522
00:57:04,291 --> 00:57:06,000
But you also can't be naive.

523
00:57:07,083 --> 00:57:10,833
Your hand is already soiled with blood
as a result of your decisions!

524
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:20,166
You're right.

525
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:24,708
Not just the villagers…

526
00:57:28,166 --> 00:57:30,041
Dika also died because of me.

527
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:33,750
That's enough, Zia. Enough, Zia.

528
00:57:37,916 --> 00:57:38,791
No, Grandpa.

529
00:57:45,833 --> 00:57:46,708
Zia?

530
00:57:46,791 --> 00:57:49,000
I've been safe all this time
because of this.

531
00:57:52,666 --> 00:57:53,583
This amulet…

532
00:57:57,333 --> 00:57:58,791
this part of my dad's body…

533
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:06,958
- this is what protected me, not you!
- Zia, don't be reckless.

534
00:58:08,416 --> 00:58:12,208
We'll revive Djarot,
we'll end the curse tonight!

535
00:58:12,291 --> 00:58:14,541
My father had the right
to be angry with you…

536
00:58:15,916 --> 00:58:20,416
and the villagers here,
who know the truth, but never do anything…

537
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:24,750
and even with me, Grandpa,

538
00:58:25,833 --> 00:58:28,250
who never tried to look for him.

539
00:58:33,208 --> 00:58:34,500
Yanto was right, Grandpa.

540
00:58:36,958 --> 00:58:38,958
Everyone here deserves to die…

541
00:58:40,041 --> 00:58:42,416
- including me.
- Zia! Zia!

542
00:58:49,208 --> 00:58:50,125
Zia!

543
00:58:52,125 --> 00:58:53,958
Zia, run!

544
01:01:42,041 --> 01:01:45,833
Father? Father! Father!

545
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:52,041
Father!

546
01:01:54,666 --> 01:01:55,541
Father!

547
01:01:56,916 --> 01:01:58,791
Father. It's me, Zia. Father.

548
01:02:00,666 --> 01:02:02,250
It's me Zia, Father.

549
01:02:11,291 --> 01:02:12,333
I won't mind.

550
01:02:13,625 --> 01:02:15,000
I won't mind, Father.

551
01:02:19,541 --> 01:02:21,125
You deserve to be angry.

552
01:03:02,916 --> 01:03:06,708
Rise, you bastard.
Stay away from my granddaughter.

553
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:18,083
Danang, I won't let you revive Djarot!

554
01:03:27,791 --> 01:03:29,500
You have the right to kill me.

555
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:49,166
Grandpa?

556
01:04:18,458 --> 01:04:20,833
Forgive me, Djarot.

557
01:04:22,375 --> 01:04:26,125
I assure you,
your vengeance will be fulfilled tonight.

558
01:05:06,375 --> 01:05:10,083
As long as my blood still flows

559
01:05:10,708 --> 01:05:14,375
on this earth…

560
01:05:15,416 --> 01:05:18,541
you will face your doom.

561
01:05:42,166 --> 01:05:44,250
You have robbed me of my time…

562
01:05:46,416 --> 01:05:48,000
took my daughter.

563
01:05:49,916 --> 01:05:50,958
Tonight…

564
01:05:52,333 --> 01:05:56,000
I'll make time go really slow
for you, old man.

565
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:06,625
My daughter regretted
being married to you.

566
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,833
During the last seconds of her life,
she really hated you.

567
01:06:12,375 --> 01:06:13,583
Liar.

568
01:06:14,625 --> 01:06:17,666
Ida regretted having your child.

569
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:21,916
If she couldn't see
the goodness within you,

570
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,458
that means you are the worst being.

571
01:06:27,958 --> 01:06:33,125
We used to be happy, old man.
I had stopped studying this damned magic.

572
01:06:34,291 --> 01:06:38,791
But you forced me to continue,
to perfect this magic!

573
01:06:40,750 --> 01:06:42,041
Because I know…

574
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:48,750
you murdered everyone
who you ordered to do your job.

575
01:06:49,708 --> 01:06:52,166
You were trying to cover your tracks.

576
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:58,791
- It was an order. I didn't have a choice.
- I don't have a choice either, old man.

577
01:06:59,708 --> 01:07:06,000
Everyone has a different way to survive.
It's the law of nature.

578
01:07:07,291 --> 01:07:08,208
Grandpa!

579
01:07:10,583 --> 01:07:13,833
Hurry, kill me
before she sees you like this.

580
01:07:15,166 --> 01:07:16,041
Father?

581
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:30,041
Zia, he's not your father anymore.
He's a demon.

582
01:07:32,125 --> 01:07:33,708
You are an adult now.

583
01:07:38,583 --> 01:07:39,458
Father!

584
01:07:52,666 --> 01:07:54,291
I missed you so much.

585
01:08:00,833 --> 01:08:01,791
Zia…

586
01:08:06,708 --> 01:08:07,666
Father?

587
01:08:10,208 --> 01:08:13,166
That's enough, Dad. Please.

588
01:08:15,125 --> 01:08:16,375
Forgive them.

589
01:08:18,333 --> 01:08:21,125
They have suffered enough, Dad. Please.

590
01:08:24,416 --> 01:08:27,541
And Grandpa,
you have right to be mad at him…

591
01:08:28,666 --> 01:08:30,833
but please don't hurt him.

592
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:33,583
Zia…

593
01:08:34,625 --> 01:08:35,916
You are very kind…

594
01:08:37,041 --> 01:08:38,541
just like your mother.

595
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:42,083
But no amount of suffering
can satisfy me anymore.

596
01:08:43,583 --> 01:08:47,833
- I want them to die, one by one.
- No, Father. Don't.

597
01:08:47,916 --> 01:08:52,333
And my spell on this one,
I will drag it to hell with me.

598
01:08:55,708 --> 01:08:57,166
Father, don't.

599
01:08:59,333 --> 01:09:00,208
Don't.

600
01:09:04,208 --> 01:09:06,958
Let me take Grandpa to the hospital first.
Dad, please.

601
01:09:08,875 --> 01:09:10,166
After that, I promise…

602
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:14,916
I will come back to you,
we'll be reunited.

603
01:09:16,291 --> 01:09:18,583
We'll make up for lost time, Father.

604
01:09:19,666 --> 01:09:22,166
- Zia…
- Please, Father.

605
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:31,708
Father!

606
01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:39,250
And you…

607
01:09:41,458 --> 01:09:46,166
as I promised,
I will kill them one by one,

608
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:51,250
- and I will come to you, old man.
- Zia, that's enough.

609
01:09:51,833 --> 01:09:56,708
Go! You don't need to see this. Go!

610
01:10:17,458 --> 01:10:18,333
Zia!

611
01:10:20,083 --> 01:10:20,958
Zia…

612
01:10:41,375 --> 01:10:42,250
Father?

613
01:10:44,208 --> 01:10:45,125
Zia…

614
01:10:47,833 --> 01:10:48,708
Father…

615
01:11:11,875 --> 01:11:12,750
Grandpa?

616
01:11:14,166 --> 01:11:17,125
- Grandpa…
- Zia?

617
01:11:19,166 --> 01:11:22,833
I didn't wanna tell you, because…

618
01:11:24,041 --> 01:11:27,875
I don't want you to carry my sin.

619
01:11:27,958 --> 01:11:34,333
Promise me
you will be a strong child, okay?

620
01:11:34,416 --> 01:11:39,375
No, Grandpa. Don't talk like that.
Come on, we're going to the hospital.

621
01:11:39,458 --> 01:11:41,416
Come on, Grandpa.

622
01:11:42,708 --> 01:11:44,125
Come on. Come on.

623
01:11:54,375 --> 01:11:56,208
I heard everything.

624
01:11:58,708 --> 01:12:00,958
This is all because of you.

625
01:12:03,041 --> 01:12:05,000
People here are dead.

626
01:12:05,958 --> 01:12:09,958
- My mother is dead.
- Zia! Zia!

627
01:12:10,041 --> 01:12:11,500
It's all your fault!

628
01:12:12,791 --> 01:12:18,958
You all have to die!
You're the one who's supposed to be dead.

629
01:12:22,458 --> 01:12:24,666
- Zia!
- Grandpa?

630
01:12:26,791 --> 01:12:27,666
Grandpa?

631
01:12:30,125 --> 01:12:31,000
Grandpa!

632
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,875
Grandpa! Grandpa!

633
01:12:38,833 --> 01:12:41,791
Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa!

634
01:12:47,166 --> 01:12:51,416
Don't die. Don't leave me.
Grandpa, get up.

635
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:40,166
If only that old man had told us
where he buried Djarot…

636
01:16:41,583 --> 01:16:43,500
we wouldn't have to wait this long.

637
01:16:47,125 --> 01:16:48,000
Take him away.

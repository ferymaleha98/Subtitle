Oh.

190
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:12,133
Sounds like a horror movie.

[Michelle chuckles]

192
00:10:13,438 --> 00:10:15,527
The house is two stories.

193
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:17,878
Up here, we have the bathroom,
library,

194
00:10:17,921 --> 00:10:20,750
fully stocked kitchen,
dining, and living room.

195
00:10:21,925 --> 00:10:23,623
In the nook back there

196
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,450
is where we'll do some
of your medical tests.

197
00:10:25,494 --> 00:10:26,930
This is amazing.

198
00:10:28,018 --> 00:10:29,498
- Downstairs, there's three
bedrooms,

199
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:32,893
three bathrooms, a den, and a
home gym,

200
00:10:32,936 --> 00:10:34,285
which is about to be your new
best friend

201
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:36,505
because as you know, atrophy is.

202
00:10:36,548 --> 00:10:37,419
A bitch.

- It's tinnitus, stay super
calm,

219
00:11:17,764 --> 00:11:19,504
and just weighty that, it'll
pass.

220
00:11:22,203 --> 00:11:23,247
Feeling better?

221
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:26,598
Yeah. [chuckles softly]

00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:37,348
Thank you.

225
00:11:39,046 --> 00:11:40,743
- I know you were briefed
pre-flight,

226
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:43,790
but just as a reminder,
expect everything from nausea

227
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:48,098
to dizziness, fever,
nosebleeds, hallucinations.

228
00:11:49,621 --> 00:11:51,493
The human body takes time to
remember

229
00:11:51,536 --> 00:11:53,147
how to function on earth.

230
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,496
Right.

231
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:56,019
- The more you report back to
us,

232
00:11:56,063 --> 00:11:57,673
the better we'll be able to
determine

233
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,067
if we need to consider
delaying future missions.

234
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,372
Delaying future missions?

235
00:12:02,896 --> 00:12:05,812
- If you exhibit any unusual
symptoms

236
00:12:05,855 --> 00:12:07,117
or severe side effects,

237
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:09,337
we can't just send you back to
training.

238
00:12:10,817 --> 00:12:11,556
All right.

239
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,080
Um.

240
00:12:13,123 --> 00:12:15,169
So, sorry, I'm just, it's,
I'm supposed to go out

241
00:12:15,212 --> 00:12:17,388
to the ISS in, um, two months.

242
00:12:17,432 --> 00:12:20,696
- Honestly, I wouldn't worry
about it.

243
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,698
Obviously, I'd rather have
you monitored at base,

244
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,092
but I don't wanna step on any
toes.

245
00:12:25,135 --> 00:12:27,398
We'll be here every
morning at 7:30 on the dot,

246
00:12:27,442 --> 00:12:29,139
so make sure you're up and
ready.

Get plenty of rest.

00:30:24,474 --> 00:30:29,218
- Mm-hm.

557
00:30:29,262 --> 00:30:30,089
[footsteps tapping]

558
00:30:30,132 --> 00:30:31,133
- [William] Let's get some fresh
air.

559
00:30:32,265 --> 00:30:33,614
Okay.

560
00:30:33,657 --> 00:30:35,181
[footsteps tapping]

561
00:30:35,224 --> 00:30:37,748
[gentle music]

562
00:30:38,924 --> 00:30:41,622
[birds chirping]

563
00:30:43,493 --> 00:30:45,495
- You're part of
something really big here.

564
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,715
I'm very proud of you, Sam.

565
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,415
What did I see out there?

566
00:30:54,374 --> 00:30:56,550
Security cameras, or were
they recording something?

567
00:30:58,987 --> 00:31:01,511
- I didn't expect you to wind
it that far from the house.

568
00:31:01,555 --> 00:31:04,079
Didn't think it was necessary
to debrief NASA on the, uh,

569
00:31:06,038 --> 00:31:07,866
on the full rundown of the
property here.

570
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,043
What do you mean?

571
00:31:13,741 --> 00:31:18,485
[suspenseful music]
[footsteps tapping]

572
00:31:20,008 --> 00:31:21,618
[door clicks]
[William sighs]

573
00:31:21,662 --> 00:31:22,706
After you.

574
00:31:24,578 --> 00:31:27,624
[footsteps tapping]

575
00:31:29,235 --> 00:31:31,846
[William sighs]

576
00:31:33,195 --> 00:31:37,156
[secret door clatters and
hisses]

577
00:31:41,508 --> 00:31:43,292
What is this place?

578
00:31:43,336 --> 00:31:44,076
[suspenseful music continues]

579
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:44,946
Truth is,

580
00:31:46,382 --> 00:31:46,992
it's a safe house.

581
00:31:49,864 --> 00:31:51,213
[Sam scoffs]

582
00:31:51,257 --> 00:31:53,302
It was very James Bond.

583
00:31:53,346 --> 00:31:54,521
[William chuckles]

584
00:31:54,564 --> 00:31:55,130
Follow me.

585
00:31:57,306 --> 00:31:58,742
[footsteps tapping]

586
00:31:58,786 --> 00:32:02,833
[secret door clatter and whirs]

587
00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:05,053
[lights whirring]

588
00:32:05,097 --> 00:32:07,055
- They probably told
you what we told them,

589
00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:09,014
that this house is for
diplomats,

590
00:32:09,057 --> 00:32:10,319
which is not entirely wrong.

591
00:32:11,277 --> 00:32:12,278
[footsteps tapping]

592
00:32:12,321 --> 00:32:15,063
Kinds of people that we normally
host here

593
00:32:15,107 --> 00:32:18,632
are in need of temporary hiding.

594
00:32:21,461 --> 00:32:23,680
[keypad beeping]

595
00:32:23,724 --> 00:32:25,204
Izzy's birthday?

596
00:32:25,247 --> 00:32:26,074
Shh.

597
00:32:27,771 --> 00:32:29,556
[door clatters]

598
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:34,343
Sometimes a place like this is
more secure than an embassy.

599
00:32:34,691 --> 00:32:35,518
It's amazing.

600
00:32:37,781 --> 00:32:38,957
Sleeping quarters there.

601
00:32:40,219 --> 00:32:42,917
[footsteps tapping]

602
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:43,787
Mess hall here.

603
00:32:44,745 --> 00:32:48,575
[footsteps tapping]

604
00:32:48,618 --> 00:32:50,098
Down here's

605
00:32:52,187 --> 00:32:54,885
the central nervous system in
the house.

606
00:32:54,929 --> 00:32:57,149
Runs on its own separate power
source.

607
00:32:57,192 --> 00:32:58,063
Wow.

608
00:32:58,106 --> 00:33:02,110
- And, uh, just to put your mind
at ease.

609
00:33:02,937 --> 00:33:05,635
[switches clicking]

610
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,464
There are security cameras
outside all around the perimeter.

611
00:33:10,162 --> 00:33:13,295
In an emergency, the house
totally shuts itself down,

612
00:33:13,339 --> 00:33:16,603
locking everything behind
three layers of Kevlar

613
00:33:16,646 --> 00:33:17,604
and copper paneling.

614
00:33:19,823 --> 00:33:21,216
A lot of these switches are tied

615
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,001
to defense systems all around
the house.

616
00:33:23,044 --> 00:33:25,133
And obviously, you won't need
any of this,

617
00:33:25,177 --> 00:33:28,571
but I didn't want you to think
that we were spying on you.

618
00:33:28,615 --> 00:33:31,096
It's good to know.

619
00:33:31,139 --> 00:33:34,838
- [inhales] Anyway, uh,
big secret revealed.

620
00:33:34,882 --> 00:33:35,839
Why don't we go back upstairs

621
00:33:35,883 --> 00:33:37,363
before they come looking for us.

622
00:33:37,406 --> 00:33:38,712
Okay.

623
00:33:38,755 --> 00:33:39,452
[footsteps tapping]

624
00:33:39,495 --> 00:33:41,671

- General Harris?
- Yes.

628
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,638
- It's 18:30, sir.
- Thank you.

629
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:54,902
I gotta get back to base.

630
00:33:54,945 --> 00:33:56,469
- You all right if I go?
- Yeah, thanks.

631
00:33:58,514 --> 00:34:00,560
[footsteps tapping]

632
00:34:00,603 --> 00:34:02,823
- Probably best that you just
stay put,

633
00:34:02,866 --> 00:34:03,737
try and get some rest.

634
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,001
And please be sure

635
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:10,526
that Dr. Aiden checks
out that bruise tomorrow.

636
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:13,312

658
00:35:51,932 --> 00:35:53,629
You've reached Professor Mark
Walker, you know what to do.

Hey, it's me.

661
00:35:56,589 --> 00:36:00,854
I, uh, can you just call
me back when you get this?

662
00:36:00,897 --> 00:36:02,899
I'm not feeling great.

663
00:36:02,943 --> 00:36:04,074
I just wanted to talk,

664
00:36:04,118 --> 00:36:06,120
so hopefully, you're not
sleeping already.

665
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,166

[phone vibrating]

746
00:43:32,218 --> 00:43:33,523
Oh, shit.

747
00:43:35,134 --> 00:43:37,876
[footsteps tapping]

748
00:43:40,661 --> 00:43:42,358
[footsteps tapping]

749
00:43:42,402 --> 00:43:44,404
You all right, Sam?

750
00:43:44,447 --> 00:43:47,363
Yeah, I think, uh.

751
00:43:47,407 --> 00:43:48,843
There's, I think there's
something wrong with the generator.

752
00:43:48,887 --> 00:43:50,018
Yeah.

753
00:43:50,062 --> 00:43:52,151
Our system's showing
there's been some blackouts.

754
00:43:52,194 --> 00:43:54,588
Might be a problem with the
grid, we'll check it out.

755
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:55,502
[footsteps tapping]

756
00:43:55,545 --> 00:43:57,678
- Okay to begin testing,
Captain?

757
00:43:57,722 --> 00:43:59,811
- Uh, yeah, I'll just be a
minute, I'm gonna change.

758
00:43:59,854 --> 00:44:02,857
[footsteps tapping]

759
00:44:02,901 --> 00:44:04,337
Can I talk to you for a second?

760
00:44:05,686 --> 00:44:06,513
What's wrong?

761
00:44:08,733 --> 00:44:11,387
Not enjoying architectural
digest Pentagon edition?

762
00:44:13,128 --> 00:44:14,477
[Sam sighs]

763
00:44:14,521 --> 00:44:15,391
Hey, talk to me.

764
00:44:16,392 --> 00:44:19,352
There's something here.

765
00:44:19,395 --> 00:44:21,528
Last night, I, maybe it was
in my mind or something,

766
00:44:21,571 --> 00:44:25,619
but the whole house
went into lockdown mode,

767
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,578
and I almost had a heart attack,

768
00:44:28,622 --> 00:44:30,058
I ended up sleeping in the
bunker.

769
00:44:30,102 --> 00:44:32,408
- Jesus, I wish you had called
me.

770
00:44:32,452 --> 00:44:34,149
I tried, there was no service.

771
00:44:35,281 --> 00:44:37,718
- [William] You wanna
transfer back to base?

772
00:44:37,762 --> 00:44:39,894
- [Sam] I don't want 'em
to know I'm struggling.

773
00:44:39,938 --> 00:44:41,766
- I will scan all of the
security footage

774
00:44:41,809 --> 00:44:44,333
while you're doing your testing.

775
00:44:44,377 --> 00:44:46,553
And then, we'll find out
what the what is, okay?

776
00:44:49,338 --> 00:44:51,297
- I'm sorry, I think I'm
just really stressed out.

777
00:44:52,994 --> 00:44:53,821
Hey.

778
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:57,956
You don't have to apologize to
me, ever.

779
00:45:03,918 --> 00:45:04,919
How's the bruising?

780
00:45:06,181 --> 00:45:07,487
- I don't know, I haven't
even thought about it.

781
00:45:09,402 --> 00:45:10,185
You got this.

782
00:45:12,274 --> 00:45:13,798
- You all right?
- Mm-hm.

783
00:45:15,625 --> 00:45:16,931
[William] Okay.

784
00:45:19,368 --> 00:45:20,413
[William sighs]

785
00:45:20,456 --> 00:45:22,937
[gentle music]

786
00:45:27,855 --> 00:45:30,466

[pedals whirring]
[Sam panting]

790
00:45:51,183 --> 00:45:54,534
[gentle music continues]

791
00:45:58,494 --> 00:46:00,758
- [Michelle] That doesn't look
like normal bruising, Sam.

792
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:02,977
That landing was no joke, huh?

793
00:46:03,021 --> 00:46:05,371
- Let's do another extra
tomorrow.

794
00:46:05,414 --> 00:46:08,417
[footsteps tapping]

795
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:15,947

[footsteps tapping]

799
00:46:24,085 --> 00:46:25,826
- [chuckles] Hey.
- Mommy.

800
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:26,609
[footsteps tapping]

801
00:46:26,653 --> 00:46:27,436
Hi, Busy Bee.

802
00:46:28,611 --> 00:46:29,917
Oh, I missed you.

803
00:46:31,832 --> 00:46:32,920
- How you doing?
- Hey.

804
00:46:32,964 --> 00:46:34,356
Okay.

805
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,532
[door clatters]

806
00:46:36,576 --> 00:46:37,577
[footsteps tapping]

807
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,448
- Makes our place look
like a college dorm.

808
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:41,581
[Izzy] Grandpa.

809
00:46:41,624 --> 00:46:43,365
Hey, pumpkin.

810
00:46:43,409 --> 00:46:44,497
Oh.

811
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:45,846
Look at you.

812
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:47,108
[William growls]

813
00:46:47,152 --> 00:46:47,892
Cool coat.

814
00:46:47,935 --> 00:46:48,762
Oh, you like that?

815
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:50,677
I like your hat.

816
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:51,983
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

817
00:46:52,026 --> 00:46:53,767
Hey, what happened?

818
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:54,942
- I lost a teeth.
- When?

819
00:46:56,378 --> 00:46:57,249
Mm, a few days ago.

820
00:46:57,292 --> 00:46:59,468
- Did you give this child some
money?

821
00:46:59,512 --> 00:47:00,252
[shoes thud]

822
00:47:00,295 --> 00:47:01,644
You know, Isabelle,

823
00:47:01,688 --> 00:47:02,776
right after I adopted your
mother,

824
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,038
one of the first gifts I gave
her

825
00:47:04,082 --> 00:47:05,735
was a telescope just like that.

826
00:47:05,779 --> 00:47:06,911
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

827
00:47:08,173 --> 00:47:09,565
What do you see, babe?

828
00:47:09,609 --> 00:47:11,132
Let's go talk outside.

829
00:47:11,176 --> 00:47:11,959
[footsteps tapping]

830
00:47:12,003 --> 00:47:14,483
What's wrong?

831
00:47:14,527 --> 00:47:16,094
What else?

832
00:47:16,137 --> 00:47:20,272
- [Izzy] I think, I think I see
Jupiter.

833
00:47:20,315 --> 00:47:21,055
Any stars?

834
00:47:22,361 --> 00:47:23,797
I think I see the Milky Way.

835
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,668
Oh, there you go.

836
00:47:25,712 --> 00:47:26,582
[Mark] Tell me.

837
00:47:27,801 --> 00:47:30,935
[footsteps tapping]

838
00:47:30,978 --> 00:47:31,805
I.

839
00:47:33,763 --> 00:47:38,159
I have this crazy bruising
spreading all over my body,

840
00:47:38,203 --> 00:47:41,249
and, um, I'm basically
seeing things that don't,

841
00:47:42,424 --> 00:47:43,773
that aren't actually there.

842
00:47:43,817 --> 00:47:45,253
Having these nightmares that.

843
00:47:45,297 --> 00:47:47,125
- Hey, hey, hey.
- [sighs] I don't feel good.

844
00:47:47,168 --> 00:47:49,083
Take a breath.

845
00:47:49,431 --> 00:47:52,217
- I don't know to describe
it, I don't feel like myself.

846
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:53,392
- Have you reported this
to the medical team?

847
00:47:53,435 --> 00:47:54,349
No.

848
00:47:54,393 --> 00:47:55,524
No.

849
00:47:55,568 --> 00:47:56,874
[Sam sighs]

850
00:47:57,178 --> 00:47:58,788
I can't risk not being able
to go on a mission again.

851
00:47:58,832 --> 00:48:00,442
- This is your health,
we're talking about, Sam.

852
00:48:00,486 --> 00:48:02,749
- Listen, I need to tell you
something.

853
00:48:02,792 --> 00:48:04,446
[Sam breathing heavily]

854
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:05,839
I just, I, I need-

855
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:06,927
You're scaring me.

856
00:48:06,971 --> 00:48:07,797
I just need you to promise me

857
00:48:07,841 --> 00:48:09,147
that you're gonna believe me.

858
00:48:10,409 --> 00:48:10,931
Yeah.

859
00:48:12,193 --> 00:48:13,542
Yeah, what it is?

860
00:48:13,586 --> 00:48:14,413
Um.

861
00:48:15,501 --> 00:48:16,981
I saw something not

862
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:23,074
from here.

863
00:48:23,117 --> 00:48:25,641
[pensive music]

864
00:48:25,685 --> 00:48:30,733
What are you saying?

865
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:33,040
Something

866
00:48:33,084 --> 00:48:33,911
not from

867
00:48:36,304 --> 00:48:37,088
this world.

868
00:48:38,654 --> 00:48:42,136
[Sam breathing heavily]

869
00:48:46,793 --> 00:48:47,620
Okay.

870
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:49,927
Okay.

871
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:53,756
Okay.

872
00:48:57,021 --> 00:48:58,065
I know it sounds nuts.

873
00:49:00,241 --> 00:49:01,112
That's, I mean.

874
00:49:02,678 --> 00:49:04,245
Why?

875
00:49:04,289 --> 00:49:08,641
- I was broadcasting signals
deep into space, for what?

876
00:49:08,684 --> 00:49:10,948
For, for fun?

877
00:49:10,991 --> 00:49:13,820
I don't know what they were
communicating.

878
00:49:13,863 --> 00:49:15,082
They registered sound waves

879
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:19,652
on the capsules receiver
right before they lost me.

880
00:49:21,306 --> 00:49:24,787
What if something followed me
back?

881
00:49:25,658 --> 00:49:28,748
[suspenseful music]

882
00:49:28,791 --> 00:49:30,750
Maybe I'm just exhausted.

883
00:49:30,793 --> 00:49:32,839
I think that we, uh.

884
00:49:32,882 --> 00:49:33,840
- Mommy.
- We should.

885
00:49:33,883 --> 00:49:34,841
[Izzy] I saw Pluto.

886
00:49:34,884 --> 00:49:36,060
Oh.

887
00:49:36,103 --> 00:49:37,496
[Izzy] I think I saw Pluto.

888
00:49:37,539 --> 00:49:39,367
- [Sam] That's amazing.
- I guess we're gonna have

889
00:49:39,411 --> 00:49:41,326
to get you a telescope
of your own, pumpkin.

890
00:49:41,369 --> 00:49:42,588
Please, Daddy.

891
00:49:42,631 --> 00:49:44,068
Yeah, yeah, sure, Izzy.

892
00:49:44,111 --> 00:49:46,157
- Do you mind if I borrow
mommy for a minute?

893
00:49:47,201 --> 00:49:48,898
I'll be right back.

894
00:49:48,942 --> 00:49:51,989
[footsteps tapping]

895
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:57,951
[suspenseful music]

896
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:01,041
[switches clicking]

897
00:50:02,173 --> 00:50:03,130
There, right there.

898
00:50:07,787 --> 00:50:09,093
[monitor warbling]

899
00:50:09,136 --> 00:50:09,963
Wh-

900
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:12,748
What?

901
00:50:12,792 --> 00:50:13,619
What happened?

902
00:50:14,315 --> 00:50:15,447
[William sighs]

903
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:16,622
It was right there.

904
00:50:16,665 --> 00:50:18,189
- I swear.
- Look.

905
00:50:18,406 --> 00:50:21,322
I know this process has been
tough on you, and the family.

906
00:50:21,366 --> 00:50:22,541
[Sam sighs]

907
00:50:22,584 --> 00:50:25,587
Maybe try to get some
sleep on the earlier side.

908
00:50:25,631 --> 00:50:26,458
Lots of water.

909
00:50:26,501 --> 00:50:28,068
- Dad, I'm telling you what I
saw.

910
00:50:28,112 --> 00:50:30,723
It was right there and it,
[sighs]

911
00:50:30,766 --> 00:50:31,724
looked like a.

912
00:50:33,204 --> 00:50:34,901
Sam, listen.

913
00:50:34,944 --> 00:50:36,859
Are you sure you wanna
push through another night?

914
00:50:36,903 --> 00:50:38,122
Yeah, I will.

915
00:50:38,165 --> 00:50:40,820
- All right, I gotta get back to
base. Um.

916
00:50:40,863 --> 00:50:42,343
I think the power here is good.

917
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:45,607
Don't forget to lock up.

918
00:50:45,651 --> 00:50:46,695
- Mm-hmm.

919
00:50:46,739 --> 00:50:47,957
Sam, if you need anything?

920
00:50:48,001 --> 00:50:49,568
You call me, yeah?

921
00:50:49,611 --> 00:50:50,960
[Sam] Okay.

922
00:50:51,004 --> 00:50:51,744
[footsteps tapping]

923
00:50:51,787 --> 00:50:53,311

What? [chuckles]

940
00:51:52,674 --> 00:51:54,633
Did your daddy tell you that
joke?

one up at school, huh?

Where'd she go?

953
00:52:38,024 --> 00:52:40,983

have gone far. Isabelle!

Probably environmental,

could be a change in weather
patterns.

from my capsule?

1011
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:00,705

process of running tests,

1012
00:56:00,748 --> 00:56:02,620

How's she doing?

- She's fine, she's just
exhausted.

1022
00:56:29,603 --> 00:56:31,126
- You should take her home to
rest.

1023
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:33,390
You just come home with us.

1024
00:56:33,433 --> 00:56:35,914
You know I can't.

1025
00:56:35,957 --> 00:56:37,219
It's just a few more days.

1026
00:56:38,307 --> 00:56:39,570

tonight?

So, I'll call you when we're
heading back.

- Mm-hm.

1035

yeah?

[Sam sighs softly]

1336
01:16:53,957 --> 01:16:55,611
I put too much time and
effort into getting them

1337
01:16:55,654 --> 01:16:56,568
to come back here.

1338
01:16:57,482 --> 01:16:58,875
Tell them to leave their ship.

1339

1357
01:17:45,878 --> 01:17:48,098
to follow me back down
to the house right now.

Right now.

1359
01:17:51,579 --> 01:17:52,929
- What are you gonna do, shoot
me?

1360
01:17:54,757 --> 01:17:55,888
I'm not gonna ask again.

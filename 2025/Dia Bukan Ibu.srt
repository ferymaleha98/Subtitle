Fm Movie

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Fm Movie

3
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,083
Mom!

4
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:58,416
Mom! Mom!

5
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:01,083
Mom!

6
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,291
Mom!

7
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:11,041
Mom...

8
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,208
Why is that cat eating her own child?

9
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,333
Dino!

10
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:06,041
Really...

11
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:07,458
Ever heard of gracefulness?

12
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,375
My eyesight is bad.

13
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,833
- Like your face.
- So put on your glasses, narcissist.

14
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:16,458
And stop acting like you can "see" ghosts.

15
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,541
You know I've got...

16
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,583
- "Inner Vision."
- "Inner Vision."

17
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:22,708
Okay?

18
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,125
Now shut up, and retake.

19
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,000
Vira! Dino! Let’s go.

20
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,916
Okay.

21
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:49,375
Come on.

22
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,666
Someone’s really excited for the move.

23
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,083
Yeah. Can’t wait.

24
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:13,291
- What’s with you?
- What’s with you?

25
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,500
What’s with you?!

26
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:15,958
- What the hell, dude?
- Stop!

27
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,000
Mom! I don’t wanna share a room with her!

28
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,458
As if I want to!

29
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:25,208
Sure, once you start having wet dreams.

30
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,166
"Dry" boy.

31
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,208
At the old home, I had my own room.

32
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:20,416
- Good Lord, I missed you! You got so tall!
- Yeah!

33
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,000
And there she is. Vira the Virus.

34
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:25,500
Shut up, chicken.

35
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:28,375
- How's school?
- All good.

36
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,875
Hey, I have something for you.

37
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,083
<i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i>.

38
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,500
What’s it about?

39
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:37,708
I don’t know.

40
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,000
A friend of mine was going
to throw it away.

41
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,166
- Thanks.
- So?

42
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,041
Dino.

43
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,208
Hold this.

44
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,291
Sis!

45
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,583
You're back with Dino.

46
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:14,083
We’ve finally reached
this middle-of-nowhere ugly house.

47
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,125
Could you be more negative?

48
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,291
What’s missing? Is the wording too stiff?

49
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,333
Most Indonesian movies sound stiff anyway.

50
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,666
This isn’t a movie.

51
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:47,625
Guys.

52
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:52,458
No doubt something sinister
happened here in the past.

53
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:56,625
And I'm worried
it’s going to happen again.

54
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,000
Hello...

55
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,166
What the hell are you guys up to?

56
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,250
This is Uncle Jamal.

57
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:16,875
For some reason, women find him repulsive.

58
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,000
Hey!

59
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,708
Don’t ask about his financial situation.

60
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,458
What kind of movie are you guys shooting?

61
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:25,416
Dino wants to start a horror channel.

62
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,000
That's right.

63
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:31,458
- You can see ghosts?
- You don’t know I have a sixth sense.

64
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,458
Come on. I’ll show you upstairs.

65
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,500
What you are doing
seems like a lot of fun.

66
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:40,000
- Of course.
- Can I join your horror thing?

67
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,041
Nah, you don't have what it takes.

68
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,958
What does it take?

69
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:02,875
Vira!

70
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,083
Are you coming or what?

71
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,375
This is your mom’s room.

72
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,416
It has a bathroom.

73
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,375
This is your room.

74
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,291
The bathroom’s over there.

75
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,166
Why am I staying with Vira?

76
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,291
I’m a big boy now. I deserve my own room.

77
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,958
Well, get your wet dreams started quickly.

78
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,791
Late bloomer, huh?

79
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,250
Vira.

80
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,250
How’s your mom lately?

81
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,125
She’s been weird.

82
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:49,708
Weird how?

83
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,041
She drinks a lot of milk.

84
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,083
Not to mention cutting up
live chickens for dinner.

85
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:57,166
- And--
- But she’s not like... that anymore, right?

86
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:03,458
Well, let me know if something's off.

87
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,875
What do you mean?

88
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,041
What is it, dear?

89
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:04,416
Your own salon.

90
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:08,916
It’s finally happening.

91
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,125
You’re still gambling online?

92
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,666
Aren't you tired of losing?

93
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,875
Sometimes.

94
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:36,416
But Dino-saur,
I only need to get lucky once.

95
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,500
- Give that. I have lucky hands. Yeah.
- What? For real?

96
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:41,875
- Before we begin,
- You...

97
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,458
I’d like to say a few words.

98
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,833
Since your father left us two years ago,

99
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,208
I...

100
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,250
haven't been quite myself.

101
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,500
I know it wasn’t easy for you all.

102
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:10,625
I'm sorry

103
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,875
for putting you through that.

104
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,583
But I also want to thank you

105
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:23,291
for never giving up on me.

106
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:33,708
That’s why I promised

107
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,750
to turn over a new leaf.

108
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:48,541
I'll never depend on anyone else again.

109
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,125
We’re all here for you, Mom.

110
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:58,500
You can still depend on us.

111
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:01,750
You’re such a kiss-ass.

112
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,583
I’m not who I was anymore, dear.

113
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:14,875
I’ve changed.

114
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,416
To Mom!

115
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,083
To Mom!

116
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,125
You are on a long school break, right?

117
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,541
Good timing for a move.

118
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,875
I don’t mind missing a bit of school.

119
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,416
I hear you. I skipped school too.

120
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,791
Is that why most girls
think you’re no good?

121
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,500
Want some hot soup on your face, Dino?

122
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,916
So, if you want to have a girlfriend,
you have to...

123
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:44,416
Old house. New house.
We still have blackouts.

124
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,583
- Dino.
- Yes.

125
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:51,125
Don’t you think it’s weird
Mom chose to move here?

126
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:57,083
Seems like nobody wants to live here.

127
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,000
Our neighborhood is so ugly.

128
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:07,000
So many abandoned houses.

129
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,291
And now Mom's opening a salon.

130
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,500
Who would want to come?

131
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,875
Check out that house.

132
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,541
It’s got a jungle growing inside.

133
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,458
Are you listening to me?

134
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:34,666
What’s with you?

135
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,666
I was always against moving here.

136
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,791
You were the one trying to win
Mom over and encouraging her.

137
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,375
Now that we’re here, what’s bothering you?

138
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,375
- Well, Mom is different now.
- Yeah.

139
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,916
She’s happier now.

140
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:54,500
Let’s go there.

141
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,791
What for? Now?

142
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,041
To shoot more content.

143
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,416
Scared?

144
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,125
- Dino!
- Come on!

145
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,250
Fine, let me get my phone.

146
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,208
Slow down.

147
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,916
FORBIDDEN

148
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,083
I feel the presence
of a young boy’s spirit here.

149
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,000
If someone's here,

150
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:53,125
please, call out to me.

151
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:57,250
This must’ve been
the residence of some Dutch people

152
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,208
who got evicted in the past.

153
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:02,166
I’ve also heard
from the locals here that--

154
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,250
Did that look real?

155
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:12,083
I’m the one who says "cut."
Why did you stop there?

156
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,416
- Fine, fine. Let’s retake.
- Dino.

157
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,250
I’m done over here.

158
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:19,125
- It's dangerous here. Let''s go.
- One more shot.

159
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,333
Dino, why are you doing somersaults?

160
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:26,000
This is supposed to be a horror.

161
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,666
Dino, I swear if you fall and die,
I’m walking away.

162
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:33,583
What did I tell you?
All these houses are dead!

163
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,333
- How am I supposed to get down?
- I’m going home.

164
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:36,875
Vira... Vira!

165
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:40,583
Just kidding. You’re actually scared?

166
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,625
Shut up and help me get down.

167
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,375
Guys, here’s our director.

168
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:48,875
I don't want to.

169
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:52,625
You’re better off as a camera operator.

170
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:55,791
Since you have no talents.
Not to mention you don't have...

171
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,291
"Inner Vision."

172
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,041
I knew you were gonna say that.

173
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,041
I sense something

174
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,291
residing within this tree.

175
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,708
Something...

176
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:18,208
- evil.
- Cut! Moving on.

177
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:21,250
Not yet. I wasn’t feeling it.

178
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,625
- Nah, it was good.
- No!

179
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:24,583
We got it.

180
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:27,833
No, we didn’t! It wasn’t creepy enough.

181
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,708
We’re supposed to give
our audience goosebumps!

182
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,500
Looking at you
already gives me goosebumps.

183
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,791
Stop it! We’re done! Moving on!

184
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,333
When Dad held the camera,

185
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,875
he’d let me have my takes.

186
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,875
Hold on.

187
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,333
I sense something

188
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:07,458
residing within this tree.

189
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,833
Something...

190
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:12,458
evil!

191
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,500
What’s so funny?

192
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:51,375
Too manly to share a room with me,

193
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,416
but too scared of a little...

194
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:03,583
p-p-p...

195
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:07,041
pussy!

196
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:13,916
What’s going on here?

197
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,458
Vira is cleaning my wounds, Mom.

198
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:20,125
Got scratched by a cat.

199
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:23,416
Mom! I don’t wanna share a room with Vira!

200
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:42,458
Why were you out this late?

201
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:53,083
This is your fault.

202
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:54,416
You were supposed
to look after your brother.

203
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,125
No, Mom, it’s not her fault.

204
00:22:58,291 --> 00:22:59,375
Sorry, Mom.

205
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:02,916
You two go up. Take a shower.

206
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,541
Sir, sorry to bother you.

207
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:41,333
Come check out our new salon.

208
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:43,250
It's my mom's. It’s right there,

209
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:46,416
- if you want to visit.
- Excuse me. There's a brand new salon.

210
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,333
- Excuse me. Sir.
- You can get a trim there.

211
00:25:49,416 --> 00:25:52,791
- Please feel free--
- Kid, we’re talking here. Do you mind?

212
00:26:20,916 --> 00:26:22,416
Good morning.

213
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:26,708
Morning, indeed.
How may we be of service, lady?

214
00:26:26,791 --> 00:26:28,791
I just opened a salon.

215
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:30,208
A salon?

216
00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:32,833
Maybe you want to check it out?
Here are the treatments.

217
00:26:35,208 --> 00:26:37,750
Wow, full package.

218
00:26:38,541 --> 00:26:40,208
- This is for men too?
- Of course!

219
00:26:40,291 --> 00:26:42,125
- Really?
- Do you want a hair spa?

220
00:26:42,791 --> 00:26:43,875
You can give hair spas?

221
00:26:43,958 --> 00:26:47,791
My head massages are pretty special.
I can give you discount.

222
00:26:59,208 --> 00:27:02,416
You tidied up? I wanted to help.

223
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:06,458
You can clean up later

224
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,625
when I’m busy with customers.

225
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:13,458
Sure thing, Mom. I can't cut hair.

226
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:29,625
It's only the first day,
and we just handed out the flyers.

227
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,875
Welcome.

228
00:27:35,958 --> 00:27:38,291
- I’d like a haircut.
- Of course. Have a seat here.

229
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,541
What kind of style do you have in mind?

230
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:55,500
- Morning.
- Good morning.

231
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:19,000
Eight customers on the first day, how?

232
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:24,375
Why question it? That's good, right?

233
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:26,791
This must be what they call...

234
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:29,083
beginner’s luck.

235
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:43,208
Let me do it.

236
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:44,708
You must be tired, right?

237
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:54,333
Fine, I’ll take a bath then.

238
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:56,416
When school starts,

239
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,000
how will you manage all this on your own?

240
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:02,333
I’ll manage just fine.

241
00:29:17,958 --> 00:29:19,500
Where have you been?

242
00:29:20,666 --> 00:29:22,291
Exploring the neighborhood.

243
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,666
Made a few friends.

244
00:29:32,458 --> 00:29:34,083
You move quick.

245
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:36,000
I sure do.

246
00:29:39,625 --> 00:29:41,083
But...

247
00:29:48,958 --> 00:29:52,000
They said this house was empty
because there was a murder here.

248
00:29:55,291 --> 00:29:56,833
The victim...

249
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,458
They were siblings.

250
00:30:03,666 --> 00:30:04,791
Really?

251
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:09,791
- Then...
- Dino!

252
00:30:11,166 --> 00:30:12,166
Dino!

253
00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:33,458
Mom?

254
00:30:37,416 --> 00:30:39,333
Power’s out again!

255
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:12,750
Mom?

256
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:18,958
What is it, dear?

257
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:23,708
I found a sanitary pad. Is it yours?

258
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:30,958
Leave it on the bed.

259
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:34,875
Are you on your period again?
I thought it had stopped.

260
00:31:40,666 --> 00:31:41,833
Thank you, dear.

261
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,708
Dumbass.

262
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:00,208
Why so jumpy? Light’s out again.

263
00:32:00,291 --> 00:32:02,958
I know. Why the hell
are you dripping all over?

264
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:04,625
I told you I was in the shower!

265
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:21,958
You haven't cut your hair
for a long time, huh?

266
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:24,791
Yes, it's been a while.

267
00:32:28,458 --> 00:32:30,958
Good morning. Please have a seat.

268
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,041
Vira.

269
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:37,041
Stop daydreaming.

270
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:41,333
Make tea for the new customers.

271
00:32:41,416 --> 00:32:42,875
Yes, Mom!

272
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:06,541
If you’re tired, just go.

273
00:33:07,916 --> 00:33:11,000
Not at all. I am fine!

274
00:33:11,083 --> 00:33:12,875
Sorry for the wait.

275
00:33:42,291 --> 00:33:43,458
Vira.

276
00:33:44,166 --> 00:33:45,583
You’ve been sighing too much.

277
00:33:46,916 --> 00:33:48,166
It’s annoying.

278
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:50,458
I don’t need you here.

279
00:34:00,458 --> 00:34:03,625
Keep scratching that.

280
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,083
You’ll get an infection.

281
00:34:10,666 --> 00:34:12,083
Where are your friends?

282
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:16,125
They’ve gone home.

283
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:17,750
Besides, we never play around here.

284
00:34:17,833 --> 00:34:19,333
Always outside this area.

285
00:34:24,916 --> 00:34:27,750
And she sighs again.

286
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:30,958
What’s up?

287
00:34:31,541 --> 00:34:32,833
Do I do that often?

288
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:36,666
Mom said the same thing.

289
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,083
Don’t you think it’s weird?

290
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:44,625
We live in this godforsaken place,
but Mom’s salon is packed.

291
00:34:45,791 --> 00:34:46,666
What?

292
00:34:47,541 --> 00:34:49,125
You were worried nobody would come.

293
00:34:49,708 --> 00:34:51,125
Now business is good, you're sulking?

294
00:34:55,708 --> 00:34:58,333
- What do you want now?
- You know!

295
00:34:58,416 --> 00:34:59,625
Come on.

296
00:35:00,416 --> 00:35:02,375
One cat attack isn’t enough?

297
00:35:02,458 --> 00:35:05,750
It’s getting dark now.

298
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:08,291
We can shoot some creepy stuff.
Guaranteed to be viral!

299
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:11,125
- Let's go.
- Gosh...

300
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:13,208
Come on! Run!

301
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:26,833
Vira and I are now in the Amazon jungle!

302
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:42,041
Chiropractic ghost.

303
00:35:44,916 --> 00:35:48,541
Why do Indonesian ghosts do bridges?

304
00:35:48,625 --> 00:35:50,916
Isn’t it harder to chase their victims?

305
00:36:19,375 --> 00:36:20,708
Careful, it’s slippery.

306
00:36:45,958 --> 00:36:47,875
Now this is content.

307
00:36:48,666 --> 00:36:49,750
So cool.

308
00:36:50,916 --> 00:36:52,333
- Dino...
- It's cool.

309
00:36:58,291 --> 00:36:59,875
Hurry up!

310
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:18,708
Dino, let’s call it a night.

311
00:37:19,375 --> 00:37:20,666
One more scene!

312
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:23,666
Let’s just go home. It’s so dark now.

313
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:26,000
Just one more scene, please.

314
00:37:26,083 --> 00:37:27,416
Don’t you see this place?

315
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:29,708
Wow!

316
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,375
Do they store dead bodies here?

317
00:37:39,416 --> 00:37:41,041
Start filming!

318
00:37:49,125 --> 00:37:50,083
Dino.

319
00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:53,500
Wait a second.

320
00:37:54,875 --> 00:37:55,916
What’s up?

321
00:38:01,666 --> 00:38:02,958
What?

322
00:38:23,708 --> 00:38:25,083
Run!

323
00:38:25,166 --> 00:38:27,333
What the hell! Not funny.

324
00:38:44,166 --> 00:38:46,166
Haha! Very funny!

325
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:30,833
Let’s go home. It’s dinner time.

326
00:39:33,625 --> 00:39:36,125
Take a shower right away.
You two are filthy.

327
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,166
Vira?

328
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:40,666
I peed a little.

329
00:39:51,666 --> 00:39:54,208
Mom, chicken soup again?

330
00:39:56,375 --> 00:39:58,666
Don’t we have anything else?

331
00:40:00,375 --> 00:40:02,333
I’m fine with it.

332
00:40:03,041 --> 00:40:05,041
You eat anything.

333
00:40:05,125 --> 00:40:07,125
You have no taste.

334
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,791
As if you have any.

335
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:14,666
Mom, I miss your other dishes.

336
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,750
We’ve been having the same--

337
00:40:22,333 --> 00:40:24,500
My son is so handsome.

338
00:40:37,875 --> 00:40:39,125
Dumbass.

339
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:54,583
<i>...Vira and I are now in the Amazon jungle!</i>

340
00:40:57,375 --> 00:40:58,500
<i>There are leaves.</i>

341
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:04,125
<i>Dino?</i>

342
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:09,250
<i>Dino?</i>

343
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:22,416
<i>Get up.</i>

344
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,375
<i>Dino, get some water.</i>

345
00:41:25,458 --> 00:41:28,083
<i>Dino, call Uncle Mal!</i>

346
00:41:28,166 --> 00:41:29,250
<i>Mom...</i>

347
00:41:30,416 --> 00:41:31,916
<i>What the hell are you doing?</i>

348
00:41:32,875 --> 00:41:34,625
<i>Call Uncle Mal!</i>

349
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,625
I’m going to the market.

350
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:40,833
I’m coming with you.

351
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,208
No need.

352
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:46,583
- But--
- I’ll cook for you tonight.

353
00:41:47,208 --> 00:41:48,625
Something other than chicken soup.

354
00:42:26,291 --> 00:42:27,250
Mom?

355
00:44:06,416 --> 00:44:07,375
Vira?

356
00:44:10,583 --> 00:44:11,791
What’s wrong with you?

357
00:44:52,708 --> 00:44:53,958
<i>Does it feel good?</i>

358
00:44:55,375 --> 00:44:58,291
- Here you go.
- If you like it, feel free to come back.

359
00:44:58,375 --> 00:44:59,541
Can I?

360
00:45:00,291 --> 00:45:03,166
- Of course.
- You're amazing.

361
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:06,125
- Amazing at what?
- At being pretty.

362
00:45:06,875 --> 00:45:09,666
- So pretty.
- Thank you.

363
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:12,708
Does this feel good?

364
00:45:12,791 --> 00:45:15,041
Yes, it feels good.

365
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,458
Where have you been?

366
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:24,708
Around.

367
00:45:24,791 --> 00:45:25,875
How’s the book?

368
00:45:27,875 --> 00:45:29,750
- What's the story about?
- Read it yourself.

369
00:45:29,833 --> 00:45:30,791
How lame.

370
00:45:44,416 --> 00:45:45,916
Are you here to see Mom?

371
00:45:46,875 --> 00:45:48,208
I’m here to see you guys.

372
00:45:48,708 --> 00:45:52,041
How's the past week been? You like it?

373
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,625
- We keep getting blackouts.
- What?

374
00:45:59,708 --> 00:46:01,375
We keep getting blackouts.

375
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:04,458
- What, blacks out?
- Blackouts! Lights out!

376
00:46:16,666 --> 00:46:19,458
- Mom’s salon is always crowded.
- Great then.

377
00:46:23,583 --> 00:46:25,458
Even though we’re
in the middle of nowhere.

378
00:46:50,333 --> 00:46:54,333
Did something bad
ever happen in this house?

379
00:46:57,041 --> 00:47:00,833
Vira, tell me. What’s up?

380
00:47:04,708 --> 00:47:08,791
Ever since we moved here,
Mom changed a lot.

381
00:47:09,916 --> 00:47:11,083
Don’t tell me she...

382
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:14,250
It’s not that!

383
00:47:14,875 --> 00:47:15,958
So what then?

384
00:47:16,541 --> 00:47:18,166
Mom’s better. That’s all that matters.

385
00:47:19,583 --> 00:47:21,750
When was the last time
you took Mom to the psychiatrist?

386
00:47:26,708 --> 00:47:28,000
It’s been a while.

387
00:47:29,625 --> 00:47:31,375
The doctor said your mom was better.

388
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,916
She doesn't need the meds anymore.

389
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:29,375
Vira?

390
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:32,875
Power’s out again.

391
00:48:35,833 --> 00:48:38,916
Yes, Mom, I’m coming.

392
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,333
I’m sleeping downstairs.

393
00:49:38,541 --> 00:49:39,583
Mom?

394
00:49:44,708 --> 00:49:45,750
Mom?

395
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:06,875
- What is it, dear?
- Mom?

396
00:50:07,833 --> 00:50:08,916
Mom, did...

397
00:50:13,125 --> 00:50:14,791
I just saw you out there.

398
00:50:15,666 --> 00:50:18,583
Your eyes. They’re problematic.

399
00:50:21,583 --> 00:50:23,500
You’re taking a bath this late at night?

400
00:50:24,208 --> 00:50:27,416
You’re wandering around
this late at night?

401
00:50:30,625 --> 00:50:32,250
Power’s out.

402
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:35,333
I got hot and was going
to sleep downstairs.

403
00:50:40,625 --> 00:50:41,583
Oh...

404
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:46,125
I’ll get back to bed then.

405
00:51:00,666 --> 00:51:02,583
Wanna sleep with me instead?

406
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:06,416
It’s fine, Mom.

407
00:51:21,291 --> 00:51:22,958
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome.

408
00:52:03,125 --> 00:52:04,041
Vira!

409
00:52:04,666 --> 00:52:05,666
Come on!

410
00:52:13,041 --> 00:52:14,291
Afternoon, sir.

411
00:52:16,041 --> 00:52:17,125
Excuse me.

412
00:52:22,041 --> 00:52:22,958
Hello?

413
00:52:24,125 --> 00:52:25,166
Hi.

414
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:26,458
Good afternoon.

415
00:52:27,291 --> 00:52:28,375
Good afternoon.

416
00:52:29,166 --> 00:52:31,083
What kind of glasses are you looking for?

417
00:52:31,916 --> 00:52:33,291
Thin frames

418
00:52:33,875 --> 00:52:35,083
or thick ones?

419
00:52:39,083 --> 00:52:41,250
It’s for my son. He needs new glasses.

420
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,041
Yes.

421
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:48,250
This is your son?

422
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:55,416
If he was your brother, I’d buy it.

423
00:52:58,166 --> 00:52:59,750
Looks like you need glasses too.

424
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,583
What’s with that optics guy?

425
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:10,875
Didn’t he just creep you out?

426
00:53:11,458 --> 00:53:13,958
I cringed so hard.

427
00:53:14,041 --> 00:53:16,416
What’s with you? He was nice.

428
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,458
We even got a huge discount.

429
00:53:19,583 --> 00:53:22,416
Oh, please, what he wants is so obvious.

430
00:53:23,125 --> 00:53:24,916
At least he’s not your father.

431
00:54:03,083 --> 00:54:09,375
Honey, I’m sorry. I’m sorry! I’m sorry!

432
00:54:09,875 --> 00:54:12,958
What do you want? Tell me!

433
00:54:14,583 --> 00:54:17,041
You’re not leaving us.

434
00:54:17,916 --> 00:54:20,333
Tell me what you want!

435
00:54:21,708 --> 00:54:22,833
No!

436
00:54:25,333 --> 00:54:26,875
I’ll grab a knife!

437
00:54:26,958 --> 00:54:28,791
You wanna see me kill myself?!

438
00:54:28,875 --> 00:54:32,458
Can’t you see we built all this together?!

439
00:54:33,875 --> 00:54:36,125
No!

440
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,666
<i>Do I look pretty?</i>

441
00:55:42,708 --> 00:55:44,000
You do.

442
00:55:45,416 --> 00:55:48,541
Heru says he likes girls in red.

443
00:55:49,666 --> 00:55:51,791
Is that optics guy really your type?

444
00:55:56,375 --> 00:55:57,458
What is it, Mom?

445
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,250
It’s been a while since I last did this.

446
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:23,708
- Mom? Is that a tattoo?
- Huh?

447
00:56:23,791 --> 00:56:24,958
Nonsense!

448
00:56:26,083 --> 00:56:27,833
Why would I have one?

449
00:56:30,458 --> 00:56:31,541
He’s here.

450
00:56:33,083 --> 00:56:34,375
I’m off then.

451
00:56:47,791 --> 00:56:48,791
Evening, Yanti.

452
00:56:49,541 --> 00:56:50,958
Evening, Heru.

453
00:56:53,083 --> 00:56:54,083
Ah yes.

454
00:56:55,708 --> 00:56:57,500
I brought you...

455
00:56:58,875 --> 00:56:59,708
this.

456
00:57:00,666 --> 00:57:01,958
The lenses are ready.

457
00:57:03,041 --> 00:57:04,041
That was quick.

458
00:57:04,625 --> 00:57:06,125
I also brought you...

459
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:10,666
this.

460
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,041
They’re lovely.

461
00:57:24,791 --> 00:57:26,208
Are you nervous?

462
00:57:27,875 --> 00:57:29,125
Why is your heart on the right side?

463
00:57:30,375 --> 00:57:32,458
The left side is for ordinary nervousness.

464
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:34,666
Right now, this is extraordinary.

465
00:57:38,708 --> 00:57:39,708
Shall we?

466
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,666
Where were you all night, Mom?

467
00:58:38,458 --> 00:58:41,166
<i>- Oh, you're the husband? Hello.
- Yes. Hi.</i>

468
00:58:42,166 --> 00:58:44,458
It's beginning to... Do you like my massage?

469
00:58:46,166 --> 00:58:47,416
I'm sorry...

470
00:58:53,708 --> 00:58:54,750
Hello.

471
00:59:41,125 --> 00:59:43,166
Lately the power outages
are so frequent. Why is that?

472
00:59:52,833 --> 00:59:53,791
Where’s Mom?

473
00:59:53,875 --> 00:59:57,125
With a guy who stayed over last night.

474
01:00:00,958 --> 01:00:02,583
- Are they fucking?
- Ew!

475
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:05,916
That’s disgusting!
Who taught you to talk like that?

476
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Like what?

477
01:00:13,083 --> 01:00:14,666
Where’s the guy from last night, Mom?

478
01:00:15,625 --> 01:00:16,541
We broke up.

479
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:22,791
Don’t you think you’re overdoing it
with the guys, Mom?

480
01:00:24,416 --> 01:00:25,416
Why?

481
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:30,625
Can’t you be happy for me?

482
01:00:40,416 --> 01:00:41,333
<i>Dino.</i>

483
01:00:42,125 --> 01:00:45,583
<i>I’ve been seeing things in this house.</i>

484
01:00:47,625 --> 01:00:50,208
And everything has something
to do with Mom.

485
01:00:56,375 --> 01:00:57,791
Then I saw this figure.

486
01:01:05,416 --> 01:01:06,875
Am I losing my mind?

487
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:24,416
Vira.

488
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:28,208
Pretending to be asleep?

489
01:03:32,583 --> 01:03:34,083
Did you just come out of your room?

490
01:03:37,375 --> 01:03:38,875
No, Mom.

491
01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:14,791
You love me, right?

492
01:04:47,625 --> 01:04:49,083
What’s wrong with your glasses?

493
01:04:51,791 --> 01:04:54,833
It fell when I was playing soccer.

494
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:58,541
One of the boys stepped on them.

495
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:02,083
Let’s eat.

496
01:05:06,958 --> 01:05:09,208
You’re going to wear those broken glasses

497
01:05:09,833 --> 01:05:11,000
forever?

498
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:13,166
I could wear my old ones.

499
01:05:13,791 --> 01:05:14,833
Forever.

500
01:05:22,458 --> 01:05:24,208
Why did I bother getting you new ones?

501
01:05:25,666 --> 01:05:29,166
- What's the big deal?
- Can you fix it?

502
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:32,125
Just go to that glasses guy.
What's his name?

503
01:05:32,208 --> 01:05:34,708
One of your fuck buddies.

504
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:49,791
Do you know how handsome you are?

505
01:05:56,458 --> 01:05:57,958
When you were a baby...

506
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:03,833
I often wondered

507
01:06:05,208 --> 01:06:09,125
who you would look like.

508
01:06:10,375 --> 01:06:12,083
Mom or Dad?

509
01:06:14,583 --> 01:06:16,375
Thank goodness you look like me.

510
01:06:21,875 --> 01:06:24,416
Even so, your face...

511
01:06:27,625 --> 01:06:30,250
still reminds me of your father.

512
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:40,875
I often prayed that you
wouldn’t turn out like him.

513
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:45,500
Entitled.

514
01:06:46,875 --> 01:06:48,000
Ungrateful.

515
01:06:48,625 --> 01:06:50,833
- Mom...
- Stay out of this.

516
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:00,125
Forgot how to say thank you?

517
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,958
You know how much your glasses cost?

518
01:07:09,583 --> 01:07:10,541
Sorry, Mom...

519
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,833
I’m sick of you.

520
01:07:20,416 --> 01:07:22,208
All you do is demand.

521
01:07:22,291 --> 01:07:24,000
Demand. Demand. Demand!

522
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:31,041
Where is your gratitude?

523
01:07:32,375 --> 01:07:34,291
You wanna milk your mom to death?

524
01:07:56,375 --> 01:07:58,250
Silence!

525
01:08:19,458 --> 01:08:20,833
Ever since you were born,

526
01:08:22,458 --> 01:08:23,833
my life has been rotten.

527
01:09:46,333 --> 01:09:48,375
Yeah, I’m coming.

528
01:09:48,458 --> 01:09:49,500
BOLD IN JUSTICE, COWARD IN DEBT COLLECTION

529
01:09:49,583 --> 01:09:50,916
Who is it?

530
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,500
- Uncle!
- Vira?

531
01:09:52,583 --> 01:09:55,500
- What happened?
- Mom is... Mom has been...

532
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:58,208
Mom has been... I’m not crazy. I’m not...

533
01:09:58,291 --> 01:09:59,583
Vira, calm down.

534
01:09:59,666 --> 01:10:01,708
Mom has... What Mom did...

535
01:10:01,791 --> 01:10:03,625
- Dino was...
- Vira.

536
01:10:10,916 --> 01:10:12,416
Vira, please forgive me.

537
01:10:16,458 --> 01:10:18,625
I've been stressed out since we moved.

538
01:10:19,666 --> 01:10:21,583
And I took it out on you and Dino.

539
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:31,208
I’m so sorry for everything.

540
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:33,541
I promise...

541
01:10:38,791 --> 01:10:40,458
I’ll go to the psychiatrist again.

542
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,583
For you and Dino’s sake.

543
01:10:47,291 --> 01:10:49,750
Yes, Vira, your mom told me.

544
01:10:49,833 --> 01:10:52,208
I’ll go with her to the doctor.

545
01:10:58,958 --> 01:10:59,958
Okay.

546
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:21,041
You love me, right?

547
01:11:30,458 --> 01:11:33,541
<i>I’m not sure a shrink can handle this.</i>

548
01:11:35,125 --> 01:11:36,125
Meaning?

549
01:11:41,958 --> 01:11:43,375
I’ve been seeing...

550
01:11:47,166 --> 01:11:48,291
A ghost?

551
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:54,333
- Looks like you need a shrink too.
- Dino, I’m serious.

552
01:11:56,833 --> 01:11:58,375
How can you say that?

553
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,208
After what she did to you?

554
01:12:03,458 --> 01:12:04,708
What do you expect me to do?

555
01:12:05,291 --> 01:12:07,375
Catch the ghost?

556
01:12:07,458 --> 01:12:08,958
You think this is a joke.

557
01:12:09,041 --> 01:12:11,291
Why am I the only one
who cares about everybody--

558
01:12:11,375 --> 01:12:12,458
You only care about Mom.

559
01:12:12,541 --> 01:12:14,541
Who would, if not me?

560
01:12:14,625 --> 01:12:16,708
You’re always off doing your own thing.

561
01:12:16,791 --> 01:12:19,041
Lost in your books. Making vlogs.

562
01:12:19,125 --> 01:12:20,750
I couldn’t care less
about those dumb vlogs!

563
01:12:22,791 --> 01:12:25,166
They’re just an excuse
so I can be with you!

564
01:12:25,250 --> 01:12:27,083
You’re also always off
playing soccer with your friends.

565
01:12:31,125 --> 01:12:33,583
Have you seen my clothes dirty
from playing soccer?

566
01:12:33,666 --> 01:12:35,541
Do I ever look exhausted?

567
01:12:35,625 --> 01:12:37,750
Or better yet, since when
have I ever liked soccer?

568
01:12:42,375 --> 01:12:44,875
There are no kids
in this godforsaken place.

569
01:12:49,708 --> 01:12:51,000
I have no friends.

570
01:12:53,166 --> 01:12:55,250
I’ve always been alone.

571
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:01,125
- But I’m always with you.
- Not anymore.

572
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:05,166
We used to be together.

573
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:19,083
Now you’re never with me.

574
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,125
The doctor gave me some meds.

575
01:14:20,833 --> 01:14:22,250
Your eyes are red.

576
01:14:28,958 --> 01:14:30,458
Forgive me.

577
01:14:38,375 --> 01:14:39,458
Let’s go in.

578
01:14:40,291 --> 01:14:41,541
I’m making dinner.

579
01:14:49,375 --> 01:14:52,000
Uncle Mal, what else did the doctor say?

580
01:14:53,041 --> 01:14:54,166
All good.

581
01:16:39,208 --> 01:16:42,000
- Dino! Dino! Wake up!
- What?

582
01:16:42,083 --> 01:16:43,333
Look at Mom in the bathroom now!

583
01:16:43,416 --> 01:16:44,791
Are you nuts?

584
01:16:44,875 --> 01:16:47,208
- You have to look!
- No!

585
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:53,000
You’re coming with me tomorrow.

586
01:16:53,833 --> 01:16:55,250
If I’m wrong,

587
01:16:55,875 --> 01:16:57,875
I’ll never say a word about Mom again.

588
01:16:57,958 --> 01:16:59,291
Ever.

589
01:17:00,666 --> 01:17:01,708
Fine.

590
01:17:41,416 --> 01:17:42,750
That was a long trip.

591
01:17:43,833 --> 01:17:45,166
And now we have a long wait.

592
01:17:46,375 --> 01:17:48,000
You sure this is mom’s shrink?

593
01:17:53,166 --> 01:17:54,291
Do you know

594
01:17:55,083 --> 01:17:58,708
that cats are capable
of killing their own children?

595
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:02,708
Huh?

596
01:18:05,416 --> 01:18:07,833
If the kittens are distant or sick.

597
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,666
Or if the mother is hungry.

598
01:18:15,250 --> 01:18:17,000
I’ve always hated cats.

599
01:18:30,333 --> 01:18:31,500
That’s not possible, Doc.

600
01:18:31,583 --> 01:18:33,958
I have no reason to lie, dear.

601
01:18:35,583 --> 01:18:39,333
Is this some sort
of patient privacy thing?

602
01:18:39,416 --> 01:18:41,458
This has nothing to do with that.

603
01:18:41,541 --> 01:18:43,375
It’s been over a year
since I last saw your mother.

604
01:18:49,166 --> 01:18:50,208
Who the fuck--

605
01:18:50,291 --> 01:18:52,041
- You lied!
- Vira, what...

606
01:18:52,125 --> 01:18:53,166
- Liar!
- What’s going on?

607
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:55,041
You lied!

608
01:18:55,125 --> 01:18:56,875
Where have you been
taking Mom all this time?

609
01:19:08,041 --> 01:19:09,041
Witchcraft?

610
01:19:13,791 --> 01:19:18,166
You saw what your mom was like
when your dad left you.

611
01:19:19,625 --> 01:19:21,166
I was just trying to help my sister.

612
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:22,708
Why take her to a shaman?

613
01:19:23,583 --> 01:19:25,708
Why not a shrink,
like normal people would?

614
01:19:28,333 --> 01:19:29,708
Well, actually...

615
01:19:30,375 --> 01:19:32,125
we tried that.

616
01:19:33,958 --> 01:19:35,583
But it didn’t help.

617
01:19:37,416 --> 01:19:39,625
They were just pushing their meds.

618
01:19:41,541 --> 01:19:43,291
But when I took her to a shaman,

619
01:19:45,750 --> 01:19:47,833
she got better.

620
01:19:49,083 --> 01:19:51,041
Like before.

621
01:19:53,583 --> 01:19:55,333
Like before she got married.

622
01:19:57,291 --> 01:19:59,125
Like before you two were born.

623
01:20:09,875 --> 01:20:12,083
Both of you should be grateful!

624
01:20:12,166 --> 01:20:13,625
You still have your mother!

625
01:20:14,166 --> 01:20:15,875
Look at me. I have no one!

626
01:20:22,958 --> 01:20:23,958
Please...

627
01:20:24,541 --> 01:20:26,416
Please get our mom back.

628
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:29,958
Look at me.

629
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:32,833
Please.

630
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:29,416
Mom...

631
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:40,791
You told them everything?

632
01:21:44,166 --> 01:21:45,208
Sorry...

633
01:21:58,083 --> 01:22:00,416
I was desperate, Vira.

634
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:03,625
I couldn’t function at all.

635
01:22:04,208 --> 01:22:05,583
I was scared.

636
01:22:05,666 --> 01:22:07,541
Scared I would put both of you in danger.

637
01:22:10,166 --> 01:22:11,875
The shaman helped me regain myself.

638
01:22:13,375 --> 01:22:15,833
And I was finally able
to restore my spirit.

639
01:22:15,916 --> 01:22:17,625
But it comes at a price.

640
01:22:19,208 --> 01:22:22,166
I had to maintain a certain ritual.

641
01:22:23,333 --> 01:22:24,875
And every time I’m careless,

642
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:29,458
- I become weak.
- It’s okay.

643
01:22:30,166 --> 01:22:33,541
When I’m weak, I’m not myself.

644
01:22:43,958 --> 01:22:46,166
So, what you’ve been seeing

645
01:22:47,333 --> 01:22:48,416
isn’t me.

646
01:22:50,083 --> 01:22:52,833
It’s the djinn

647
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,125
- that possessed me.
- Djinn?

648
01:22:56,208 --> 01:22:57,625
That’s what you saw?

649
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:05,708
What are we supposed to do?

650
01:23:08,791 --> 01:23:10,291
Vira, you must help me.

651
01:23:12,375 --> 01:23:13,875
You want to do that, right?

652
01:23:14,458 --> 01:23:17,000
Please...

653
01:23:17,583 --> 01:23:20,541
Please help me get
this djinn out of my body.

654
01:23:23,125 --> 01:23:24,250
Help me.

655
01:23:25,416 --> 01:23:26,541
Please, Vira, help me.

656
01:23:26,625 --> 01:23:27,958
Help your mom.

657
01:23:28,041 --> 01:23:29,166
Please help...

658
01:23:32,041 --> 01:23:33,458
Please, Vira, help me.

659
01:23:49,625 --> 01:23:50,958
Good evening.

660
01:24:00,958 --> 01:24:03,500
I only have tea. But it’s good tea.

661
01:24:08,416 --> 01:24:09,625
Please, help yourself.

662
01:24:14,708 --> 01:24:17,375
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Medea.

663
01:24:17,458 --> 01:24:19,166
How may I be of service?

664
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:21,125
My mom got possessed by a djinn.

665
01:24:21,208 --> 01:24:23,791
Please get it out.

666
01:24:27,375 --> 01:24:29,958
Your understanding of witchcraft

667
01:24:30,583 --> 01:24:33,708
is probably from
horror movies or viral threads.

668
01:24:36,291 --> 01:24:38,166
It doesn’t work like that.

669
01:24:40,458 --> 01:24:43,750
When Yanti first came here,

670
01:24:44,541 --> 01:24:47,625
she had a severe clash within her psyche.

671
01:24:49,458 --> 01:24:51,916
Between Yanti as a woman

672
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,041
and Yanti as a mother.

673
01:24:55,458 --> 01:24:59,333
<i>So, I implanted something into her</i>

674
01:24:59,416 --> 01:25:01,125
<i>to separate those two clashing sides.</i>

675
01:25:02,666 --> 01:25:06,291
But such an implant...

676
01:25:07,875 --> 01:25:09,250
requires a regular sacrifice.

677
01:25:09,916 --> 01:25:11,750
In the form of chicken blood.

678
01:25:19,583 --> 01:25:23,500
I accidentally tasted my son’s blood.

679
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:27,750
Yanti.

680
01:25:28,666 --> 01:25:30,416
I’ve warned you.

681
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:33,541
That is the one thing you must not do.

682
01:25:37,791 --> 01:25:39,541
We must pull out that implant.

683
01:25:40,708 --> 01:25:41,833
This is dangerous.

684
01:25:43,833 --> 01:25:45,166
Dangerous how?

685
01:25:47,041 --> 01:25:48,875
That implant has been contaminated.

686
01:25:49,875 --> 01:25:51,625
And it’s craving will never be satisfied

687
01:25:51,708 --> 01:25:54,666
until it has consumed
all of her children’s blood.

688
01:26:01,333 --> 01:26:02,458
Wait outside. All of you.

689
01:26:03,125 --> 01:26:04,500
Yanti, get in.

690
01:26:10,875 --> 01:26:13,833
Whatever you hear, do not come in.

691
01:30:07,166 --> 01:30:08,166
Thank you.

692
01:30:18,875 --> 01:30:20,166
Is it done?

693
01:30:41,666 --> 01:30:42,750
Let’s go home.

694
01:30:53,083 --> 01:30:54,041
Yanti.

695
01:30:54,750 --> 01:30:56,750
You screamed like
you were giving birth again.

696
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:08,708
I want to thank you both.

697
01:31:10,625 --> 01:31:12,041
You too, Jamal.

698
01:31:15,541 --> 01:31:17,666
I promise to be better.

699
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:20,750
You don’t need to be better.

700
01:31:23,416 --> 01:31:25,208
You just need to be our mom.

701
01:31:38,791 --> 01:31:40,333
You should move in with us, Uncle Jamal.

702
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:41,375
For real?

703
01:31:41,916 --> 01:31:44,041
For real. But promise us this.

704
01:31:44,708 --> 01:31:47,916
If you're going to live here,
no more online gambling.

705
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,041
- It's done.
- No more loan sharks.

706
01:31:50,125 --> 01:31:51,625
Sure, sure. I promise.

707
01:31:52,333 --> 01:31:53,333
That’s right.

708
01:31:56,291 --> 01:31:57,541
Stay here.

709
01:31:59,041 --> 01:32:00,291
Live with us.

710
01:32:05,125 --> 01:32:06,083
Alright.

711
01:32:07,958 --> 01:32:09,166
I’m going upstairs.

712
01:32:10,458 --> 01:32:12,916
I need to rest. I’m exhausted.

713
01:32:49,375 --> 01:32:50,750
Don’t stay up too late.

714
01:33:09,583 --> 01:33:12,250
- Uncle Jamal is crying.
- He's crying.

715
01:33:12,333 --> 01:33:13,625
Oh, shut up.

716
01:33:17,166 --> 01:33:18,291
Dammit.

717
01:33:19,958 --> 01:33:22,041
I forgot to say goodbye to Medea.

718
01:34:07,083 --> 01:34:09,125
- Morning.
- Where’s Uncle Jamal?

719
01:34:09,791 --> 01:34:10,791
He went home.

720
01:34:11,750 --> 01:34:14,250
- Without saying anything?
- Said he had some errands to do.

721
01:34:16,375 --> 01:34:18,166
Running away from loan sharks again?

722
01:34:19,583 --> 01:34:23,750
A debt-ridden guy who forgot his wallet.

723
01:34:25,291 --> 01:34:27,375
Even loan sharks would feel bad
if they saw this wallet.

724
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,333
Breakfast is ready.

725
01:34:42,958 --> 01:34:44,000
Take it. Take it.

726
01:34:46,166 --> 01:34:47,916
Your hair grows so fast.

727
01:34:52,583 --> 01:34:54,000
I’ll give you a trim later.

728
01:35:10,250 --> 01:35:13,125
Mom, I’m going out.

729
01:35:13,208 --> 01:35:14,208
Where are you going?

730
01:35:14,291 --> 01:35:17,250
I’m gonna shoot some footage around here.

731
01:35:18,041 --> 01:35:19,666
- Be careful.
- Okay.

732
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:24,916
Did you finish the book?

733
01:35:26,375 --> 01:35:27,458
I did.

734
01:35:31,708 --> 01:35:32,666
Good.

735
01:35:33,250 --> 01:35:34,250
It’s pretty sick.

736
01:35:35,041 --> 01:35:37,583
The main character stabs his own painting.

737
01:35:37,666 --> 01:35:38,875
But he’s the one that died.

738
01:35:40,625 --> 01:35:43,333
How come? Is the painting cursed?

739
01:35:43,416 --> 01:35:45,541
No, it’s the other way around.

740
01:35:46,416 --> 01:35:50,666
The painting bears his sins.
The protagonist is the bad guy.

741
01:35:58,916 --> 01:36:00,333
Not too short, okay, Mom?

742
01:36:01,083 --> 01:36:02,458
So demanding.

743
01:36:19,250 --> 01:36:21,541
What do you say if I color my hair?

744
01:36:23,541 --> 01:36:24,916
What color?

745
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Blue.

746
01:36:28,750 --> 01:36:30,000
How about red?

747
01:36:36,958 --> 01:36:38,791
Your mustache is growing.

748
01:36:41,083 --> 01:36:43,666
How about a shave?

749
01:36:45,333 --> 01:36:47,750
Sure. Like at those barbershops?

750
01:36:57,791 --> 01:36:59,208
Please don’t move.

751
01:37:02,291 --> 01:37:04,125
My son is so handsome.

752
01:37:04,708 --> 01:37:06,916
Too bad his eyes are problematic.

753
01:37:17,041 --> 01:37:18,125
Mom?

754
01:37:20,041 --> 01:37:21,041
Mom?

755
01:37:22,208 --> 01:37:23,250
Mom!

756
01:37:43,083 --> 01:37:44,125
Uncle Jamal?

757
01:39:58,583 --> 01:39:59,583
Dino!

758
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:13,541
Dino?

759
01:40:15,083 --> 01:40:16,083
Vira...

760
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:38,416
I’ve been bad.

761
01:40:41,333 --> 01:40:43,541
I’m an ungrateful boy.

762
01:41:03,166 --> 01:41:04,541
Mom!

763
01:41:06,375 --> 01:41:07,875
Mom!

764
01:41:37,041 --> 01:41:39,666
Din... Dino!

765
01:41:40,791 --> 01:41:41,916
Dino...

766
01:41:43,625 --> 01:41:44,583
Dino!

767
01:41:55,958 --> 01:41:58,125
Don’t fuss, dear.

768
01:42:20,041 --> 01:42:21,291
Mom...

769
01:42:32,375 --> 01:42:35,083
Do you think you know your mother?

770
01:42:44,583 --> 01:42:47,958
All her life, demanded.

771
01:42:49,625 --> 01:42:51,083
Milked dry.

772
01:42:52,750 --> 01:42:54,375
And discarded.

773
01:42:57,833 --> 01:42:59,083
If it weren’t for me,

774
01:43:00,083 --> 01:43:01,958
your mother would've died long ago!

775
01:43:09,375 --> 01:43:11,958
- Do you think you know your mother?!
- Mom!

776
01:43:12,041 --> 01:43:12,958
Mom...

777
01:43:24,916 --> 01:43:28,083
Your mother was never allowed

778
01:43:29,708 --> 01:43:31,375
to live her life.

779
01:43:36,125 --> 01:43:37,500
Only now,

780
01:43:38,958 --> 01:43:41,250
I'm taking my life back.

781
01:43:53,541 --> 01:43:57,750
Your mother had given her life to you.

782
01:44:02,083 --> 01:44:04,625
Now, are you willing
to give it back to her?

783
01:44:07,875 --> 01:44:10,125
Are you?!

784
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:20,833
Dino.

785
01:44:23,458 --> 01:44:24,625
Come here, Dino.

786
01:44:25,458 --> 01:44:26,500
Come here, dear.

787
01:44:38,333 --> 01:44:40,041
Mom!

788
01:44:51,041 --> 01:44:52,333
Dino...

789
01:44:53,541 --> 01:44:55,833
Show mommy you love her.

790
01:45:06,666 --> 01:45:08,125
Dino!

791
01:45:15,875 --> 01:45:17,083
Dino, don’t...

792
01:45:20,041 --> 01:45:20,875
I’m sorry.

793
01:45:22,250 --> 01:45:23,375
Don’t...

794
01:45:24,083 --> 01:45:25,375
Don’t...

795
01:45:44,791 --> 01:45:46,250
I’m with you.

796
01:45:49,833 --> 01:45:51,458
I’m with you. Always.

797
01:46:25,958 --> 01:46:27,458
Dino...

798
01:47:32,875 --> 01:47:34,791
I... I’m willing.

799
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,000
I’m willing.

800
01:47:41,541 --> 01:47:43,083
I’m willing, Mom...

801
01:52:58,750 --> 01:52:59,875
<i>Mom?</i>

802
01:53:01,833 --> 01:53:04,916
<i>Why did that cat eat her own child?</i>

803
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:28,458
Vira...

804
01:54:30,708 --> 01:54:32,916
She's not the mother.

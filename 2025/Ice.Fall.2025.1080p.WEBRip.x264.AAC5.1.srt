3
00:00:46,218 --> 00:00:47,805
Oh, okay. Hold on, hold on man--

4
00:00:47,806 --> 00:00:50,084
Hey, what's going on? Chill man.

5
00:00:50,912 --> 00:00:53,328
I was here 8 months ago. Can you
please just check your papers?

6
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:54,226
Okay.

7
00:00:55,124 --> 00:00:56,573
Okay, you're gonna do it or?

8
00:00:57,264 --> 00:00:58,230
Yeah.

9
00:00:58,437 --> 00:00:59,541
Like now?

10
00:00:59,542 --> 00:01:00,715
Just a second.

11
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:03,339
What do you mean a second,
I've been here like 5 minutes.

12
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:06,273
Okay.

13
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,556
This isn't my watch.

14
00:01:16,766 --> 00:01:18,457
What the fuck
are you talking about?

15
00:01:21,357 --> 00:01:23,704
No, mine is a Seiko.

16
00:01:23,945 --> 00:01:25,878
And this, is a Casio.

17
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,884
That's the fucking watch
you left here eight months ago.

18
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:35,474
I know the watch I left,
and it wasn't that one.

19
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:38,270
Now get the fuck out of
here before I call someone.

20
00:01:39,823 --> 00:01:40,721
Bloodsucker.

21
00:01:41,756 --> 00:01:43,689
- Beat it, loser.
- Fuck off!

22
00:01:45,346 --> 00:01:46,485
Hi, can I help you?

23
00:01:47,521 --> 00:01:48,384
What do you got?

24
00:01:57,634 --> 00:01:59,912
Can you put it in
the drawer, please?

25
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:02,812
Thank you.

26
00:02:11,821 --> 00:02:13,305
Mid-century French.

27
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,894
Looks like imitation.

28
00:02:17,861 --> 00:02:18,759
Not worth a lot.

29
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:25,352
Well, at least it's ticking.

30
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:32,807
Hello?

31
00:02:35,534 --> 00:02:36,535
Argh!

32
00:03:06,841 --> 00:03:07,704
Hey.

33
00:03:08,947 --> 00:03:10,982
You can be all over that,
I know you're not.

34
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:12,536
Come on, man.

35
00:03:12,537 --> 00:03:14,641
I thought she was jacking you,
to be totally honest.

36
00:03:14,642 --> 00:03:16,644
- Are you kidding me?
- Nah, I'm kidding.

37
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,925
Hands up!
Everybody out! Move! Move!

38
00:03:56,995 --> 00:03:58,685
Get the hell out on the ground!

39
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:04,899
Move! Get out! Get the fuck
down! On the ground!

40
00:04:06,729 --> 00:04:08,317
There's nothing left!

41
00:04:08,593 --> 00:04:09,939
There's nothing left!

42
00:04:10,871 --> 00:04:12,354
You have to believe me.

43
00:04:12,355 --> 00:04:16,427
We moved it all to
the headquarters this afternoon.

44
00:04:16,428 --> 00:04:17,912
You don't have to do that.

45
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:19,913
Last chance.

46
00:04:19,914 --> 00:04:21,536
I'm telling the truth.

47
00:04:21,537 --> 00:04:22,675
There's nothing left!

48
00:04:22,676 --> 00:04:23,573
Left.

49
00:04:33,031 --> 00:04:34,722
I'm telling the truth.

50
00:04:35,551 --> 00:04:36,414
Right.

51
00:04:46,596 --> 00:04:47,666
And...

52
00:04:48,357 --> 00:04:50,081
- center.
- I'll tell- I'll tell--

53
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:51,601
I'll tell you where it is.

54
00:04:51,877 --> 00:04:53,016
I'll tell you where it is.

55
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:01,956
Hurry up.

56
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:36,991
Oh!

57
00:05:39,511 --> 00:05:41,927
It won't be long before the
Albanians get here. Let's go!

58
00:05:44,758 --> 00:05:47,622
You guys don't even know who
you're stealing from, do you?

59
00:05:47,623 --> 00:05:48,899

They haven't seen shit, bro.

72
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,113
Okay.

73
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,668
- Let's move out.
- Yeah.

74
00:06:59,108 --> 00:07:01,454
Mmm. Can you smell it?

75
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:02,145
Can you smell it?

76
00:07:02,663 --> 00:07:03,595
Woo!

77
00:07:05,148 --> 00:07:07,184
- Start a new life!
- Shit.

78
00:07:07,185 --> 00:07:10,118
With this amount of money,
you could start a whole bunch of
fucking lives.

79
00:07:16,712 --> 00:07:17,781
Problems?

80
00:07:17,782 --> 00:07:19,714
Smooth as silk,
just like you planned.

81
00:07:19,715 --> 00:07:20,716
All right, everybody.

82
00:07:21,268 --> 00:07:22,511
No fuck-ups.

83
00:07:24,513 --> 00:07:26,860
Lay low. Keep to your routines.

84
00:07:27,205 --> 00:07:28,655
Don't meet one another.

85
00:07:29,207 --> 00:07:31,451
Make sure no
one's sniffing our trail.

86
00:07:31,658 --> 00:07:34,039
On the 10th,
we get across to Rez.

87
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:35,524
And as usual,

88
00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:37,697
- split the money.
- Yes!

89
00:07:37,698 --> 00:07:38,974
Woo!

90
00:07:38,975 --> 00:07:41,114
Mr. Rhodes, just to say
thank you very much for

91
00:07:41,115 --> 00:07:43,221
giving me a second chance to be
a part of this.

92
00:07:45,775 --> 00:07:46,776
Take care of the car.

93
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,571
Boom.

94
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:57,787
New pilot?

95
00:07:58,788 --> 00:07:59,789
What happened to Finn?

96
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,792
Finn is no
longer with us anymore.

97
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,276
Hmm.

98
00:08:07,763 --> 00:08:08,729
Got the last one.

99
00:08:28,231 --> 00:08:30,301
Come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on.

100
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:31,544
Easy does it.

101
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:32,994
Come on, motherfucker, come on.

102
00:08:32,995 --> 00:08:33,961
Shit!

103
00:08:37,931 --> 00:08:39,104
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

104
00:08:40,036 --> 00:08:41,244
Ugh!

105
00:08:44,662 --> 00:08:46,352
Ah!

106
00:10:47,025 --> 00:10:47,888
Ugh.

107
00:13:41,544 --> 00:13:43,132
Jesus Christ!

108
00:15:32,345 --> 00:15:33,173
How's his temp?

109
00:15:34,278 --> 00:15:37,004
- 101.
- Clinic get his meds?

110
00:15:37,005 --> 00:15:38,626
- Not yet
- Keep him cool.

111
00:15:38,627 --> 00:15:39,524
Plenty of water

112
00:15:42,355 --> 00:15:45,460
Honey, 20 years ago, I
brought your fever down.

113
00:15:45,461 --> 00:15:47,429
So don't tell me what to do.

114
00:15:49,017 --> 00:15:51,087
Thank you, Carol.
You're a lifesaver.

115
00:15:51,088 --> 00:15:53,642
He's family to
me. Both of you are.

116
00:15:56,403 --> 00:15:59,406
You know, your grandmother
would have been proud.

117
00:16:00,407 --> 00:16:03,789
Fuck no. She would've killed
me for putting on this uniform.

118
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,411
Half the Rez still wants to.

119
00:16:05,412 --> 00:16:07,206
Forget those bellyaches.

120
00:16:07,207 --> 00:16:09,002
Always complaining.

121
00:16:09,554 --> 00:16:12,212
You're doing good things, Ani.
I know it.

122
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:31,197
And I just wanted to go at it.

123
00:16:32,612 --> 00:16:34,613
But Jim dives in, chasing after

124
00:16:34,614 --> 00:16:36,166
- Mornin'!
- his favorite hook.

125
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:38,618
Ugh, fellas, this is Annie.

126
00:16:39,377 --> 00:16:41,102
- Hi.
- She's taking over Tom.

127
00:16:41,103 --> 00:16:43,794
And uh, get this, she's
real Native American.

128
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:46,143
- Oh, wow. Blackfeet?
- Blackfoot.

129
00:16:47,213 --> 00:16:48,696
Blackfoot. Right.

130
00:16:48,697 --> 00:16:51,319
Hey , well, nice to meet
you. We're just headed out.

131
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,701
- Yeah.
- Lakes closed, guys.

132
00:16:53,426 --> 00:16:56,049
- On whose authority?
- On my authority.

133
00:16:58,707 --> 00:17:00,777
Right. Come on,
cut us some slack here.

134
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:02,710
We just drove for 75 miles.

135
00:17:02,711 --> 00:17:04,263
And the ice is still blue.

136
00:17:04,264 --> 00:17:06,162
It was clear yesterday.
It'll be gray tomorrow.

137
00:17:06,163 --> 00:17:07,440
Less than four inches thick.

138
00:17:08,165 --> 00:17:08,820
Early thaw.

139
00:17:09,718 --> 00:17:11,099
Climate change, y'know?

140
00:17:11,513 --> 00:17:12,858
Climate's always been changing.

141
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:14,067
It's called weather.

142
00:17:15,137 --> 00:17:15,793
You can't go out.

143
00:17:19,797 --> 00:17:21,178
And who's gonna to stop us?

144
00:17:23,801 --> 00:17:24,629
You?

145
00:17:32,154 --> 00:17:33,085
She's cute.

146
00:17:36,365 --> 00:17:37,608
- Oh yeah!
- Yeah, boy.

147
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,334
Oh, no. Ani, Ani, Ani. Hey, Ani.

148
00:17:40,335 --> 00:17:42,751
Hey, you can't treat
any tourists this way.

149
00:17:43,786 --> 00:17:45,580
I mean,
they bring in good money.

150
00:17:45,581 --> 00:17:46,788
Are you serious?

151
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:49,101
They're good folks,
all right? Let's just

152
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:51,311
be a little bit
more accommodating.

153
00:17:51,622 --> 00:17:53,244
You want me to talk to them?

154
00:17:53,451 --> 00:17:55,590
- No.
- Hey, what the fuck, lady?

155
00:17:55,591 --> 00:17:58,836
Wait, wait, wait! Ho-hold up.
Guys, she's got a job to do,
all right?

156
00:17:59,216 --> 00:18:00,561
But look,

157
00:18:00,562 --> 00:18:02,702
I'm sure if we play nice,
she'll take it off.

158
00:18:02,943 --> 00:18:03,875
Am I right, warden?

159
00:18:05,774 --> 00:18:06,912
The choice is yours.

160
00:18:06,913 --> 00:18:08,259
You're fucking kidding me.

161
00:18:10,158 --> 00:18:11,883
Okay. No fishing.

162
00:18:13,195 --> 00:18:13,851
We get it.

163
00:18:22,515 --> 00:18:23,585
Uh,

164
00:18:24,241 --> 00:18:26,174
Jed Matuzak just called in.

165
00:18:26,726 --> 00:18:29,659
He said his truck's stuck out
there in the middle of a lake,

166
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,146
about three miles east of
the old mill. -Yeah,
I'll head out there now.

167
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,390
Oh, uh, and by the way,
a bunch of us are headed

168
00:18:36,391 --> 00:18:38,392
out to Slippery Rock tonight
if you want to join.

169
00:18:38,393 --> 00:18:39,290
Little man's sick.

170
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,259
Rain check, then.

171
00:18:54,581 --> 00:18:55,513
We're all sinners.

172
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:00,587
I was a sinner.

173
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,143
But, uh

174
00:19:04,488 --> 00:19:05,799
the Lord, he forgives a sinner.

175
00:19:08,216 --> 00:19:09,596
Luke tells us that, uh,

176
00:19:10,873 --> 00:19:12,185
sinning is human.

177
00:19:12,841 --> 00:19:14,946
But if you do sin,
then you gotta repent.

178
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,431
Like he said in that
story about the son who

179
00:19:17,432 --> 00:19:20,296
took his inheritance and
then whored and gambled

180
00:19:20,297 --> 00:19:22,436
and did all the wrong things...
He returned home,

181
00:19:22,437 --> 00:19:23,817
prodigal, he called him.

182
00:19:24,335 --> 00:19:26,474
But the father, he
welcomed the sinner son back

183
00:19:26,475 --> 00:19:28,269
and the kid, well, he repented.

184
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,926
And so they threw
a big party for him.

185
00:19:29,927 --> 00:19:30,824
Really, what I'm--

186
00:19:32,654 --> 00:19:33,827
what I'm saying is that...

187
00:19:38,004 --> 00:19:39,661
repentance can
lead to redemption.

188
00:19:41,732 --> 00:19:44,390
For our Lord has space in
his heart for sinners, for sure.

189
00:19:45,632 --> 00:19:46,702
Let us pray.

190
00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:48,531
Thank you. Thank you very much.

191
00:19:48,532 --> 00:19:49,395
Thank you.

192
00:19:53,675 --> 00:19:55,470
You have a moment
for a sinner, Father?

193
00:19:58,266 --> 00:19:59,783
No sins I can help you with.

194
00:19:59,784 --> 00:20:01,648
Oh, it's
something you definitely can.

195
00:20:04,651 --> 00:20:06,446
The tracker was tripped, Pen.

196
00:20:07,447 --> 00:20:08,621
Yesterday out on the lake.

197
00:20:14,868 --> 00:20:17,249
That plane disappeared
almost six months ago.

198
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,218
Never made it to the
other side of the Rez.

199
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:22,255
Twenty million dollars

200
00:20:22,945 --> 00:20:23,912
is under that ice.

201
00:20:25,362 --> 00:20:29,813
So, I'm thinking
the tracking device leads us
to the sunken Cessna.

202
00:20:29,814 --> 00:20:31,506
We have diving equipment.

203
00:20:31,851 --> 00:20:33,991
Go for the suitcases,
and that's it.

204
00:20:35,786 --> 00:20:37,408
Nothing against the law.

205
00:20:37,822 --> 00:20:39,685
Nothing against Jesus.

206
00:20:39,686 --> 00:20:40,860
- Nah...
- You're a native.

207
00:20:42,102 --> 00:20:43,862
So we could use you as a guide.

208
00:20:43,863 --> 00:20:45,760
Help us with
your people on the ice.

209
00:20:45,761 --> 00:20:47,038
My people...

210
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:55,737
You owe us.

211
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:00,431
Sirena and Ellis.

212
00:21:01,432 --> 00:21:02,295
Mm-hmm.

213
00:21:04,918 --> 00:21:06,782
Dax is on
the other side of the lake.

214
00:21:09,578 --> 00:21:10,959
We're a team again.

215
00:21:11,615 --> 00:21:13,305
Just like the good old days.

216
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:14,031
Come on.

217
00:21:16,136 --> 00:21:17,552
That's blood money.

218
00:21:18,794 --> 00:21:21,520
Yeah, well, there's a little
blood on every dollar bill.

219
00:21:21,521 --> 00:21:22,419
Don't you think?

He found me.

226
00:21:40,402 --> 00:21:41,886
Is that why you changed
your name to Milcham?

227
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:44,648
Milcham's a kind of phoenix.

228
00:21:46,753 --> 00:21:48,307
So you rose from the ashes.

229
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:50,964
Me too.

230
00:21:51,827 --> 00:21:52,725
Check this out.

231
00:21:55,831 --> 00:21:57,523
I've been sober three months.

232
00:21:59,594 --> 00:22:00,698
And all that other shit.

233
00:22:01,734 --> 00:22:02,735
That's great, man.

234
00:22:04,771 --> 00:22:05,876
Day at a time, right?

235
00:22:08,465 --> 00:22:09,500
Proud of you, Ellis.

236
00:22:10,605 --> 00:22:11,606
Yeah, you know, I...

237
00:22:12,538 --> 00:22:13,918
got some projects of my own now.

238
00:22:17,405 --> 00:22:18,544
Need some startup funding.

239
00:22:20,477 --> 00:22:24,446
♪ Ridin', ridin', ridin'
Born to live and die ♪

240
00:22:50,576 --> 00:22:52,543
About ten hours before
this starts melting.

241
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,443
The tracker's moving on the ice.

242
00:22:56,754 --> 00:22:58,135
Could be
the current shifting it.

243
00:23:02,933 --> 00:23:04,659
Or maybe
somebody else is out there.

244
00:23:06,108 --> 00:23:07,765
The fuck
you mean "somebody else"?

245
00:23:09,008 --> 00:23:10,665
Who'd you tell
about the money, Pen?

246
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,185
I didn't tell
anybody about the money.

247
00:23:14,634 --> 00:23:15,463
Come on, man.

248
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:20,744
Yeah, all right.

249
00:23:21,814 --> 00:23:22,642
Let's move.

250
00:23:40,522 --> 00:23:41,729
Morning.

251
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:42,731
Morning.

252
00:23:43,042 --> 00:23:44,663
I hit one of those...

253
00:23:44,664 --> 00:23:45,733
warm

254
00:23:45,734 --> 00:23:46,803
currents.

255
00:23:46,804 --> 00:23:47,736
No worries, Jed.

256
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,498
The ice gave way.

257
00:23:52,672 --> 00:23:54,191
- I can get you out of there.
- Thanks.

258
00:23:57,815 --> 00:23:58,644
How's Martha?

259
00:23:59,092 --> 00:24:00,197
Miserable.

260
00:24:00,784 --> 00:24:02,509
But she is
married to me, after all.

261
00:24:03,545 --> 00:24:04,166
That is true.

262
00:24:07,273 --> 00:24:08,101
Who's that?

263
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,207
It's Harlan.

264
00:24:11,277 --> 00:24:12,727
I passed him a ways back.

265
00:24:13,037 --> 00:24:13,693
You know him?

266
00:24:14,901 --> 00:24:16,661
I've seen him from time to time.

267
00:24:16,662 --> 00:24:18,457
- Hmm.
- He lives off the land.

268
00:24:18,905 --> 00:24:20,148
Looking for his wife.

269
00:24:22,046 --> 00:24:23,047
Yeah.

270
00:24:23,565 --> 00:24:24,704
He's a poacher, then, huh?

271
00:24:28,812 --> 00:24:31,124
- I see you got help already?
- Mm-hmm.

272
00:24:33,195 --> 00:24:34,024
You been fishing?

273
00:24:35,922 --> 00:24:36,853
Yeah.

274
00:24:36,854 --> 00:24:37,890
What'd you catch?

275
00:24:38,546 --> 00:24:40,099
A couple of walleye, a perch.

276
00:24:41,238 --> 00:24:42,826
Got a license for this?

277
00:24:43,758 --> 00:24:45,967
- Gonna take a look.
- It's just fishing gear, and...

278
00:24:48,935 --> 00:24:50,660
Uhh, no, don't--

279
00:24:51,697 --> 00:24:52,629
The fuck is this?

280
00:24:54,872 --> 00:24:55,907
I-I found it.

281
00:24:55,908 --> 00:24:57,080
You found it?

282
00:24:57,081 --> 00:24:58,911
- Where?
- It's-- It was...

283
00:24:59,567 --> 00:25:01,188
- Under the ice.
- Under the ice?

284
00:25:01,189 --> 00:25:02,948
- Okay.
- I was gonna...

285
00:25:02,949 --> 00:25:05,193
I'm gonna need you to
take off your backpack, slowly.

286
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:08,920
Hands up where I can see them.

287
00:25:11,268 --> 00:25:13,201
Place them on the cab of the
truck. No sudden movements.

288
00:25:15,928 --> 00:25:17,308
Did I do something illegal?

289
00:25:17,826 --> 00:25:18,758
Hands on the truck.

290
00:25:19,863 --> 00:25:21,278
You have any
weapons? Anything sharp?

291
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:22,693
Knife.

292
00:25:23,798 --> 00:25:24,799
Bow's in the sled.

293
00:25:29,873 --> 00:25:31,322
Hands behind your back. Come on.

294
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:36,638
Ma'am, I don't understand.

295
00:25:37,121 --> 00:25:38,019
Mm-hmm.

296
00:25:43,265 --> 00:25:44,128
Stay there.

297
00:25:45,854 --> 00:25:46,959
Jesus, boy.

298
00:25:48,236 --> 00:25:49,582
You clean out the casino?

299
00:25:50,859 --> 00:25:52,204
Sheriff Raleigh, this is Ani.

300
00:25:52,205 --> 00:25:52,930
<i>Check.</i>

301
00:25:54,035 --> 00:25:55,588
<i>I just arrested a poacher.</i>

302
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:57,382
Name of Harlan--

303
00:25:57,383 --> 00:25:58,591
What's your last name?

304
00:25:59,834 --> 00:26:00,697
Fanshaw.

305
00:26:01,836 --> 00:26:02,870
Harlan Fanshaw.

306
00:26:02,871 --> 00:26:04,285
I'm about 40 minutes out.

307
00:26:04,286 --> 00:26:05,942
Just send me your location.

308
00:26:05,943 --> 00:26:08,290
- It's no problem, Ani.
- <i>A whole suitcase full of cash.</i>

309
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,327
<i>Millions.</i>

310
00:26:10,776 --> 00:26:12,086
You said how much money?

311
00:26:12,087 --> 00:26:13,986
Yeah, a real
fucking win on the lottery.

312
00:26:14,918 --> 00:26:16,401
You expecting some more help?

313
00:26:36,249 --> 00:26:37,353
Hey folks, uh,

314
00:26:37,354 --> 00:26:38,251
lake's closed.

315
00:26:38,873 --> 00:26:39,701
Early thaw.

316
00:26:44,948 --> 00:26:46,639
You should turn
around for your safety.

317
00:26:51,092 --> 00:26:52,852
I think you've
got something of ours.

318
00:26:55,441 --> 00:26:57,269
I don't know what
you're talking about.

319
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,168
No?

320
00:27:01,378 --> 00:27:02,379
Okay.

321
00:27:04,933 --> 00:27:06,141
Get on your fucking knees.

322
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,004
Now.

323
00:27:08,005 --> 00:27:09,143
Hey, D.

324
00:27:09,144 --> 00:27:10,076
Now.

325
00:27:11,837 --> 00:27:14,079
Thought you said no violence,
man.- There is no violence.

326
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,047
Search the truck.

327
00:27:16,911 --> 00:27:19,430
- Let's just get the money--
- Search the fucking truck.

328
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:21,398
Okay.

329
00:27:27,473 --> 00:27:28,439
Who's the prisoner?

330
00:27:29,889 --> 00:27:31,028
Just a poacher.

331
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:34,273
How we lookin'?

332
00:27:35,826 --> 00:27:37,345
There's one case.

333
00:27:40,866 --> 00:27:41,901
Where's the rest of it?

334
00:27:43,523 --> 00:27:45,180
There's... there's more?

335
00:27:46,492 --> 00:27:47,389
Ah...

336
00:27:49,737 --> 00:27:50,945
You mind telling me?

337
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,325
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

338
00:27:53,326 --> 00:27:54,465
- No? Okay.
- I don't know.

339
00:27:57,779 --> 00:27:59,055
Left. Ugh!

340
00:28:46,794 --> 00:28:47,484
Go!

341
00:28:51,833 --> 00:28:54,318
Ahh!

342
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:01,153
Ah!

343
00:29:03,155 --> 00:29:04,052
Ah!

344
00:29:09,126 --> 00:29:10,196
Argh!

345
00:29:14,373 --> 00:29:15,374
Ugh!

346
00:29:41,331 --> 00:29:42,435
Well fuck me, Drake.

347
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:44,506
I thought you were dead.

348
00:29:46,888 --> 00:29:48,026
Ev--

349
00:29:48,027 --> 00:29:50,133
Everybody in the SUV.

350
00:29:50,616 --> 00:29:52,549
Looks like
the tire got hit by a bullet

351
00:29:53,653 --> 00:29:55,034
You two fix the tire.

352
00:29:55,552 --> 00:29:57,277
Serena, call Dax.

353
00:29:57,278 --> 00:29:59,487
Tell him to get to them
from the north. Yeah?

354
00:30:06,632 --> 00:30:08,185
Fuck!

355
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:11,118
They said "Where's
the rest of the money?".

356
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:13,397
Where's the rest of the money,
and who the fuck are they?

357
00:30:15,365 --> 00:30:16,331
There's a plane.

358
00:30:17,574 --> 00:30:19,471
- Plane where?
- Where I found the case.

359
00:30:19,472 --> 00:30:20,645
Under the ice.

360
00:30:20,646 --> 00:30:22,509
There's more money in the plane?

361
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,062
And you're a part of it?

362
00:30:24,063 --> 00:30:25,962
What are they doing?
Drugs? Weapons? What?

363
00:30:27,032 --> 00:30:28,447
I just live on the land.

364
00:30:28,688 --> 00:30:31,312
Yeah, Jed told me some bullshit
about your wife.

365
00:30:31,657 --> 00:30:32,968
I found the case.

366
00:30:32,969 --> 00:30:34,280
I saw the plane. That's it.

367
00:30:40,321 --> 00:30:42,254
I was supposed to
check fishing licenses,

368
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,602
not shoot and get shot at.

369
00:30:46,603 --> 00:30:48,329
I'm not made for this shit.

370
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:54,542
Hey Sirena.

371
00:30:56,544 --> 00:30:59,098
From the north?
I'm on my way, babe.

372
00:31:05,622 --> 00:31:06,691
Raleigh.

373
00:31:06,692 --> 00:31:07,900
Come in, Raleigh.

374
00:31:08,314 --> 00:31:09,245
<i>Yes Ani, talk to me.</i>

375
00:31:09,246 --> 00:31:11,076
We got multiple shooters
<i>on the ice.</i>

376
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:12,973
<i>Jed's dead.</i>

377
00:31:12,974 --> 00:31:14,285
What? You're shitting me.

378
00:31:14,286 --> 00:31:15,494
<i>Jed's dead, Raleigh.</i>

379
00:31:16,219 --> 00:31:17,495
<i>Me and the poacher got away,</i>

380
00:31:17,496 --> 00:31:20,325
but they're
coming. Send help now.

381
00:31:20,326 --> 00:31:22,535
<i>Shit, Ani.
Who the hell are they?</i>

382
00:31:22,984 --> 00:31:24,951
The poacher, is he
anything to do with this?

383
00:31:24,952 --> 00:31:26,262
I- I- I don't know. Maybe.

384
00:31:26,263 --> 00:31:27,678
Okay, listen. Uh...

385
00:31:28,438 --> 00:31:29,646
Head for station 11.

386
00:31:30,405 --> 00:31:33,062
I-I'm calling for
backup. I'm on my way.

387
00:31:33,063 --> 00:31:35,307
- <i>I'm coming.</i>
- Copy that.

388
00:31:46,594 --> 00:31:48,112
No, no, no, no, no, no.

389
00:31:48,113 --> 00:31:50,045
No. No!

390
00:31:50,046 --> 00:31:51,012
What the fuck!

391
00:31:52,393 --> 00:31:53,290
Fuck, no!

392
00:31:55,672 --> 00:31:56,535
Fuck!

393
00:31:59,607 --> 00:32:01,642
- You got a plan?
- Get to station 11.

394
00:32:01,643 --> 00:32:04,438
- How far is that?
- Two miles.

395
00:32:04,439 --> 00:32:06,959
On foot, that's too far.
We're not gonna make it.
They got wheels.

396
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,995
Any suggestions?

397
00:32:08,996 --> 00:32:10,720
We gotta split up. They
can't follow both of us.

398
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:12,033
It's not happening.

399
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:16,141
If either of us go under,
we'll both drown with these on.

400
00:32:17,004 --> 00:32:17,694
Come on.

401
00:32:19,627 --> 00:32:21,491
Got a bullet for you
if you try anything.

402
00:32:27,635 --> 00:32:28,498
Hurry.

403
00:32:30,569 --> 00:32:31,501
Okay, let's go.

404
00:32:31,811 --> 00:32:32,951
Keep 50 feet apart.

405
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:39,267
Oh, man.

406
00:32:40,613 --> 00:32:41,580
That was bad luck.

407
00:32:44,583 --> 00:32:46,067
Do you believe that bullshit?

408
00:32:50,175 --> 00:32:52,762
A long time ago, five or six
warriors were chased out here by

409
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:55,042
thirty soldiers from the
1st American Regiment.

410
00:32:57,216 --> 00:32:59,287
Soldiers had guns. The
natives knew the lake .

411
00:33:01,358 --> 00:33:03,395
Warriors pushed them
right out into the center.

412
00:33:05,362 --> 00:33:08,296
When night came, the ice had
melted. The soldiers started
to panic.

413
00:33:09,746 --> 00:33:11,092
In the middle of the night,

414
00:33:12,335 --> 00:33:14,440
God brought
his wrath down upon them and,

415
00:33:15,338 --> 00:33:16,477
they all burned to death.

416
00:33:18,237 --> 00:33:21,068
Their charred bodies found days
later, half frozen in the ice.

417
00:33:27,384 --> 00:33:31,147
You've become
a fucking bedwetter, Pen.

418
00:33:33,287 --> 00:33:35,254
You need to turn
that God shit off.

419
00:33:36,152 --> 00:33:37,153
You see,

420
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,775
I believed in him once,

421
00:33:40,363 --> 00:33:42,606
but there's money out there.

422
00:33:43,745 --> 00:33:47,300
And now that we finally get
a hit on the signal,
you want to quit?

423
00:33:47,301 --> 00:33:48,473
It's not worth it, bro.

424
00:33:48,474 --> 00:33:49,613
The fuck it isn't.

425
00:33:51,512 --> 00:33:52,375
Ready!

426
00:33:53,652 --> 00:33:56,241
You want to leave, be my guest.

427
00:33:57,587 --> 00:33:58,691
Start walking.

428
00:34:00,521 --> 00:34:03,420
But Rhodes is the devil.

429
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:06,561
And we made
a deal with the devil.

430
00:34:08,391 --> 00:34:09,633
You know the consequences.

431
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:16,743
People have lived on this land
for over a thousand years.

432
00:34:16,744 --> 00:34:18,056
We know our forest.

433
00:34:18,366 --> 00:34:19,229
We know the ice.

434
00:34:21,369 --> 00:34:23,751
Those murderers have no idea
what they're walking into.

435
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:34,624
You know how to
walk the gray ice?

436
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:35,865
The weak stuff?

437
00:34:35,866 --> 00:34:36,764
Some.

438
00:34:53,505 --> 00:34:54,299
We're clear!

439
00:35:01,306 --> 00:35:03,722
Got him. Ellis, start
the truck. Let's move!

440
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:09,210
Ellis, give us some
fucking gas, let's go!

441
00:35:11,419 --> 00:35:14,112
No, no, no. The ice
will give. Ellis, don't.

442
00:35:16,804 --> 00:35:18,530
- I'm getting out.
- No, you'll sink it.

443
00:35:21,843 --> 00:35:24,224
Ellis, stay still.

444
00:35:24,225 --> 00:35:26,192
Make a line. Hold each other's
hands.

445
00:35:26,193 --> 00:35:27,469
Furthest out on the strong ice.

446
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,334
It's going to sink
and take us with it.

447
00:35:31,784 --> 00:35:33,889
Just do as
he fucking says, okay?

448
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:36,548
Ellis, now move
slowly to the other seat.

449
00:35:39,861 --> 00:35:40,724
Slowly.

450
00:35:43,624 --> 00:35:44,935
Ugh, ah!

451
00:35:46,868 --> 00:35:48,697
I got a bad feeling about
this, Pen.

452
00:35:48,698 --> 00:35:50,595
Don't worry, stay calm.
We're getting you out.

453
00:35:50,596 --> 00:35:52,942
The Irish say a bullet's made
for each of us the day
we're born.

454
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:54,461
The Irish are born liars.

455
00:35:54,462 --> 00:35:55,773
I'm tossing
you the belt. You hang on.

456
00:35:59,295 --> 00:36:00,917
We're going to
get you out, stay calm!

457
00:36:02,021 --> 00:36:03,815
- No!
- Don't let go!

458
00:36:03,816 --> 00:36:04,817
Pull! Pull!

459
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:06,956
Holy shit!

460
00:36:06,957 --> 00:36:08,269
My foot's caught!

461
00:36:09,305 --> 00:36:11,409
Don't let go. You hear
me? Don't you let go.

462
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:15,311
Ah!

463
00:36:17,554 --> 00:36:18,727
Ahh!

464
00:36:18,728 --> 00:36:19,728
Hang on.

465
00:36:22,352 --> 00:36:23,353
Hang on, you hear me?

466
00:36:23,836 --> 00:36:25,390
Fucking pull.

467
00:36:26,253 --> 00:36:27,771
Grab it, grab
it, grab it, grab it!

468
00:36:28,738 --> 00:36:29,842
Pull!

469
00:36:47,446 --> 00:36:48,309
Hey.

470
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,416
It's this way.

471
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,903
Yes, I'm sure.

472
00:36:56,317 --> 00:36:57,870
Where'd you learn
to speak Blackfoot?

473
00:36:58,906 --> 00:36:59,769
My wife.

474
00:37:00,563 --> 00:37:01,460
So she is real.

475
00:37:03,497 --> 00:37:04,843
We're not going
to reach help in time.

476
00:37:05,775 --> 00:37:07,051
Sheriff's coming.

477
00:37:07,052 --> 00:37:09,018
We're not going to make
it to him either. Listen.

478
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:11,401
Listen, of
here. I got some gear.

479
00:37:12,057 --> 00:37:13,334
We should head there.

480
00:37:17,614 --> 00:37:19,063
Ice is melting faster that way.

481
00:37:19,064 --> 00:37:20,478
I know, but

482
00:37:20,479 --> 00:37:22,481
if we make it there, at
least we have a chance.

483
00:37:23,413 --> 00:37:24,276
By doing what?

484
00:37:26,485 --> 00:37:27,348
What I do.

485
00:37:28,107 --> 00:37:28,936
Hook.

486
00:37:30,765 --> 00:37:31,628
Come on.

487
00:37:46,574 --> 00:37:47,506
What happened?

488
00:37:48,127 --> 00:37:48,990
They're up ahead.

489
00:37:49,991 --> 00:37:51,509
Hey, they're moving quick.

490
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:53,857
We're losing a millimeter
of ice every 30 minutes.

491
00:37:55,411 --> 00:37:57,584
Yo, Dax, let's get
the snowmobile down.

492
00:37:57,585 --> 00:38:00,450
- You can get to them faster.
- Put some fucking clothes on.

493
00:38:00,657 --> 00:38:03,419
We'll take the truck around
the weak ice and meet you at
the shore.

494
00:38:09,563 --> 00:38:11,805
The hide's over there. How
many rounds you got left?

495
00:38:11,806 --> 00:38:12,704
I'm out.

496
00:38:13,394 --> 00:38:14,601
What?

497
00:38:14,602 --> 00:38:16,639
Never tell a suspect
you're out of bullets.

498
00:38:16,915 --> 00:38:17,778
Police academy.

499
00:38:18,744 --> 00:38:20,367
Whoa, wait. Shit.

500
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:24,025
The ice is too thin.

501
00:38:25,406 --> 00:38:28,029
The cars will pull us under.
We're going to have to
go around.

502
00:38:32,068 --> 00:38:33,863
Nah, let's run for it.

503
00:38:35,623 --> 00:38:36,486
Okay.

504
00:38:40,697 --> 00:38:41,526
Okay, you ready?

505
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,121
Is this your family?

506
00:39:26,985 --> 00:39:27,848
Yeah.

507
00:39:45,693 --> 00:39:47,385
I have a son about that age.

508
00:39:47,592 --> 00:39:49,456
He's at home now. He's sick.

509
00:40:03,711 --> 00:40:05,092
Here, hold this.

510
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:11,098
Where did you get these?

511
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:29,979
Do you hear that?

512
00:40:30,531 --> 00:40:31,532
Fuck.

513
00:40:38,194 --> 00:40:39,988
I only got that one
shitty arrow,

514
00:40:39,989 --> 00:40:42,060
so I got to get him off
that snowmobile if I'm going to
get a shot.

515
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,210
Get ready to run!

516
00:40:58,973 --> 00:40:59,836
Run!

517
00:41:01,804 --> 00:41:03,012
Ahhh!

518
00:41:11,158 --> 00:41:12,021
Ugh!

519
00:41:16,681 --> 00:41:17,751
Ahh!

520
00:41:26,242 --> 00:41:27,105
Gahh!

521
00:41:53,303 --> 00:41:55,582
Ah! Ahh!

522
00:42:55,987 --> 00:42:57,022
Ah!

523
00:43:03,857 --> 00:43:06,031
Now tell me where
the fucking plane is!

524
00:43:06,722 --> 00:43:09,034
Ahhhh! Ahhh!

525
00:43:17,146 --> 00:43:18,871
Ahhhh!

526
00:43:18,872 --> 00:43:20,632
Ah! Ah! Ahhh!

527
00:43:27,915 --> 00:43:30,193
Okay? Are
you okay? Are you okay?

528
00:43:31,678 --> 00:43:32,919
They're gonna come for us.

529
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:33,955
Ahh!

530
00:43:36,683 --> 00:43:37,717
Okay.

531
00:43:37,718 --> 00:43:38,857
Come on. Come on.

532
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:40,963
Come on.

533
00:43:46,071 --> 00:43:47,417
We gotta get you someplace warm.

534
00:43:49,454 --> 00:43:51,110
I know a place.

535
00:43:51,111 --> 00:43:52,008
Let's go.

536
00:44:12,132 --> 00:44:13,271
Look at the snowmobile.

537
00:44:14,824 --> 00:44:15,860
Where the fuck is he?

538
00:44:18,725 --> 00:44:19,449
Dax!

539
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:21,900
Where the fuck is he?

540
00:44:22,901 --> 00:44:23,730
Sirena?

541
00:44:37,364 --> 00:44:38,227
Dax!

542
00:44:41,161 --> 00:44:42,092
Honey!

543
00:44:42,093 --> 00:44:43,128
Honey?

544
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:44,405
Honey, hey, honey!

545
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:48,927
Ugh!

546
00:45:05,979 --> 00:45:07,774
What? What?

547
00:45:08,429 --> 00:45:10,430
It's not fucking fair!

548
00:45:10,431 --> 00:45:13,987
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey! Okay, okay.

549
00:45:14,919 --> 00:45:16,091
It's gonna be okay.

550
00:45:16,092 --> 00:45:18,093
They're gonna pay for this.

551
00:45:18,094 --> 00:45:18,992
It's gonna be okay.

552
00:45:38,494 --> 00:45:41,393
Yo, I think
they went this way. Up here.

553
00:45:59,618 --> 00:46:00,896
I can't feel my fingers.

554
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:04,312
There's a hide up
here in the forest.

555
00:46:04,313 --> 00:46:05,452
Not many know about it.

556
00:46:09,042 --> 00:46:09,870
Harlan!

557
00:46:28,924 --> 00:46:30,408
The woman!

558
00:46:32,203 --> 00:46:35,068
Not the poacher. We need
him for coordinates.

559
00:46:35,896 --> 00:46:36,586
Fuck!

560
00:46:40,107 --> 00:46:40,970
Come on.

561
00:46:42,661 --> 00:46:45,077
Ellis! Pen! Let's go!

562
00:46:48,288 --> 00:46:49,323
We're leaving a trail.

563
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:52,395
Come on, we have to lose them.

564
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:18,558
There, there. Let's go, come
on.

565
00:47:27,672 --> 00:47:29,294
She knows what she's doing.

566
00:47:29,708 --> 00:47:31,157
They're in the water!

567
00:47:31,158 --> 00:47:32,263
That way.

568
00:48:12,199 --> 00:48:14,338
This way! Come on!

569
00:48:14,339 --> 00:48:15,685
Move, let's go!

570
00:48:29,078 --> 00:48:30,941
Wait, wait, stop!

571
00:48:30,942 --> 00:48:31,943
What?

572
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:34,256
It's a medicine wheel.

573
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:35,533
Sacred.

574
00:48:37,293 --> 00:48:38,329
Yeah.

575
00:48:38,777 --> 00:48:40,331
This is a hunting ground.

576
00:48:40,745 --> 00:48:42,609
- It's bear country.
- Oh, fuck off.

577
00:48:43,299 --> 00:48:45,404
So what you're saying
is we shouldn't be here.

578
00:48:45,405 --> 00:48:47,751
Hey, I don't give a fuck
about your woo-woo shit.

579
00:48:47,752 --> 00:48:49,201
- Let's go!
- Guys, hold on!

580
00:48:49,202 --> 00:48:50,443
I'm gonna get them and I'm--

581
00:48:50,444 --> 00:48:51,617
Ahh!

582
00:48:51,618 --> 00:48:53,757
Fuck! Ahh!

583
00:48:53,758 --> 00:48:56,311
Sirena! Ah, fuck!

584
00:48:56,312 --> 00:48:59,419
- Fuck! Goddamn it.
- Get me the fuck out!

585
00:49:00,247 --> 00:49:02,111
Ahhh! Ohhh!

586
00:49:03,078 --> 00:49:06,287
- Here, get behind me.
- Fucking help me, guys!

587
00:49:06,288 --> 00:49:07,702
All right, give me your hand.

588
00:49:07,703 --> 00:49:09,359
Give me your hand! -I need
fucking help or something.

589
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:10,981
You have to pull your foot out.

590
00:49:10,982 --> 00:49:13,397
You're gonna have to pull
your foot out. -Fuck you, Pen!

591
00:49:13,398 --> 00:49:16,194
Hey! Hey! Hey! I'll pull you
out -Fuck, ah, ah! Oh my God.

592
00:49:18,196 --> 00:49:20,128
Ellis, grab her arm.

593
00:49:20,129 --> 00:49:22,406
- Here.
- Okay, okay. Okay.

594
00:49:22,407 --> 00:49:23,615
- You ready?
- Yeah.

595
00:49:24,271 --> 00:49:26,203
- Let's go.
- One, two, three.

596
00:49:26,204 --> 00:49:27,999
- Let's go!
- Ahh!

597
00:49:29,828 --> 00:49:31,037
Okay guys, let's go!

598
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,485
Okay.

599
00:49:32,486 --> 00:49:33,384
Ah!

600
00:49:34,074 --> 00:49:35,350
Fuck, okay.

601
00:49:35,351 --> 00:49:36,249
You good?

602
00:49:37,146 --> 00:49:39,390
I got it. I got it. Ah!

603
00:49:54,508 --> 00:49:55,474
Come on.

604
00:49:55,475 --> 00:49:56,476
It's up here.

605
00:49:56,717 --> 00:49:57,615
Missing fuel.

606
00:50:05,657 --> 00:50:06,555
Watch your head.

607
00:50:16,772 --> 00:50:18,532
Get your clothes
off. All of them.

608
00:50:19,706 --> 00:50:21,742
- No fire.
- They won't find us here.

609
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,055
We're too deep in the caves.

610
00:50:27,714 --> 00:50:28,784
Ah.

611
00:50:29,302 --> 00:50:31,373
Ah.

612
00:50:36,516 --> 00:50:37,413
Mhm.

613
00:50:38,449 --> 00:50:40,071
Ah, goddamn it.

614
00:50:51,669 --> 00:50:53,394
- Come on.
- Okay, come on.

615
00:50:53,395 --> 00:50:54,292
Mhm.

616
00:50:56,398 --> 00:50:57,261
Fuck!

617
00:50:59,194 --> 00:51:00,195
I got it. I got it.

618
00:51:02,266 --> 00:51:03,129
Whew.

619
00:51:04,923 --> 00:51:06,201
- All right.
- Careful.

620
00:51:06,511 --> 00:51:08,065
- Just figure this out.
- Ah!

621
00:51:09,204 --> 00:51:10,239
Turn the light on.

622
00:51:11,275 --> 00:51:12,275
Do it!

623
00:51:12,276 --> 00:51:13,415
- Alright.
- Fucking do it!

624
00:51:18,282 --> 00:51:19,352
You good? Yeah?

625
00:51:20,456 --> 00:51:21,319
Ah!

626
00:51:26,704 --> 00:51:27,600
Ah!

627
00:51:27,601 --> 00:51:28,499
Oh God.

628
00:51:29,258 --> 00:51:30,466
Oh, my God. Ah!

629
00:51:32,365 --> 00:51:33,434
Ugh!

630
00:51:33,435 --> 00:51:35,506
- Mhm...
- Almost, almost. Ugh.

631
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,404
Ah. Fuck.

632
00:51:39,475 --> 00:51:40,821
I'm gonna fucking kill them!

633
00:51:44,273 --> 00:51:45,102
We lost them.

634
00:51:46,655 --> 00:51:47,759
They're long gone by now.

635
00:51:50,279 --> 00:51:51,349
Yeah, well, fuck this.

636
00:52:00,669 --> 00:52:01,532
Come on.

637
00:52:09,816 --> 00:52:10,679
Ugh.

638
00:52:14,545 --> 00:52:15,408
Thank you.

639
00:52:16,305 --> 00:52:17,168
Thank you.

640
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:28,490
Is it true?

641
00:52:28,869 --> 00:52:30,630
- Uh?
- What Jed told me about you?

642
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:33,253
Looking for your wife?

643
00:52:38,293 --> 00:52:39,397
I'm not looking for her.

644
00:52:43,608 --> 00:52:44,471
She's dead.

645
00:52:47,578 --> 00:52:48,441
Fuck, Drake.

646
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:52,721
It's on me.

647
00:52:53,031 --> 00:52:54,619
No. Stop with that bullshit.

648
00:52:55,344 --> 00:52:56,000
We're a team.

649
00:52:58,485 --> 00:52:59,969
And we're stronger as a team.

650
00:53:01,523 --> 00:53:02,351
We'll get them.

651
00:53:03,594 --> 00:53:04,526
It was too much money

652
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:09,219
to keep everyone together
as a team, I mean...

653
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:10,773
Everyone had
their different plans.

654
00:53:14,812 --> 00:53:16,469
Me and Dax,
We were gonna...

655
00:53:19,506 --> 00:53:20,507
We were gonna...

656
00:53:20,749 --> 00:53:22,233
Hey, come on, Sirena.

657
00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:26,306
I don't see
you wiping no babies' asses.

658
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:34,970
No.

659
00:53:36,385 --> 00:53:37,938
Sure.

660
00:53:40,078 --> 00:53:41,390
She O-- ODed.

661
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:48,811
It's not like she's a
junkie, you know. She--

662
00:53:54,334 --> 00:53:56,405
We-We lost o-our daughter, Kai.

663
00:54:01,099 --> 00:54:02,687
I wa-was in Afghanistan.

664
00:54:08,693 --> 00:54:10,385
She got some kind of
infection.

665
00:54:11,351 --> 00:54:12,421
Lung.

666
00:54:15,424 --> 00:54:16,667
Her little heart just...

667
00:54:20,602 --> 00:54:21,913
Little heart just stopped.

668
00:54:29,818 --> 00:54:30,957
I-I came home...

669
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:36,065
It was like Mia
was already gone.

670
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:39,379
She wouldn't let me touch her.

671
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:44,072
She stopped talking till
the house was just

672
00:54:44,073 --> 00:54:45,074
just silent.

673
00:54:46,006 --> 00:54:46,869
It was dead.

674
00:54:49,596 --> 00:54:51,942
I mean I-I don't know what
the fuck to do with the pain.

675
00:54:51,943 --> 00:54:54,704
So i-it's like I blow
my brains out or I

676
00:54:54,705 --> 00:54:55,843
drink. So I-I--

677
00:54:55,844 --> 00:54:57,432
You know, I just stayed drunk.

678
00:55:03,438 --> 00:55:05,716
I don't know how long she's
been dead when I found her.

679
00:55:08,753 --> 00:55:09,789
She was already cold.

680
00:55:14,034 --> 00:55:15,104
This place is...

681
00:55:20,006 --> 00:55:22,353
It's the only place where
I feel close to her.

682
00:55:35,746 --> 00:55:37,334
Yeah, yeah, I know.

683
00:55:38,749 --> 00:55:40,682
But for almost fucking drowning
in that car today,
I deserve this.

684
00:55:44,996 --> 00:55:46,964
You think there's a
chance at a second life?

685
00:55:49,449 --> 00:55:51,485
You gotta grab what you
can in your first one.

686
00:55:51,486 --> 00:55:52,452
That's my opinion.

687
00:55:53,211 --> 00:55:54,454
I used to think that.

688
00:55:56,214 --> 00:55:57,354
Until I found God.

689
00:56:00,011 --> 00:56:01,944
Chances are too
high he doesn't exist.

690
00:56:08,123 --> 00:56:09,400
Now, Rhodes, though...

691
00:56:10,505 --> 00:56:11,747
He exists for sure.

692
00:56:23,172 --> 00:56:24,449
Mr. Rhodes.

693
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:25,830
Thank the heavens you're here.

694
00:56:37,014 --> 00:56:38,084
Look, Mr. Rhodes.

695
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:40,673
I know how this looks, but

696
00:56:41,018 --> 00:56:42,606
we got everything under control.

697
00:56:44,573 --> 00:56:45,712
She begs to differ.

698
00:56:47,162 --> 00:56:49,129
It's just a game
warden and a poacher.

699
00:56:53,996 --> 00:56:55,653
This was not meant to happen.

700
00:56:55,964 --> 00:56:56,896
They killed him.

701
00:56:58,242 --> 00:56:59,450
They killed Dax.

702
00:57:07,838 --> 00:57:08,908
They will pay for this.

703
00:57:22,197 --> 00:57:23,025
It's quillwork.

704
00:57:25,131 --> 00:57:25,959
It's beautiful.

705
00:57:27,651 --> 00:57:28,721
She said

706
00:57:29,722 --> 00:57:30,688
it contained her love.

707
00:57:33,553 --> 00:57:35,624
She wanted me to wear it
if I went on a mission.

708
00:57:37,074 --> 00:57:37,937
Said

709
00:57:39,594 --> 00:57:40,905
it would bring me home safe.

710
00:57:42,976 --> 00:57:44,633
Some pretty powerful medicine.

711
00:57:50,225 --> 00:57:51,260
Bear.

712
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:52,883
It's my spirit guide.

713
00:57:55,299 --> 00:57:56,611
Do you know what hers was?

714
00:57:58,682 --> 00:58:00,235
It's a bear, too.

715
00:58:02,168 --> 00:58:03,756
And you've
never felt her spirit?

716
00:58:05,792 --> 00:58:06,862
I mean I--

717
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:10,245
I-I think about
her all the time.

718
00:58:13,041 --> 00:58:16,113
My people,
we have a cleansing ritual.

719
00:58:16,354 --> 00:58:18,287
Helps us mourn our loved ones.

720
00:58:19,254 --> 00:58:20,289
And then afterwards,

721
00:58:21,187 --> 00:58:22,015
we move on.

722
00:58:23,569 --> 00:58:24,811
We keep living.

723
00:58:25,225 --> 00:58:26,503
You can't bring Mia back.

724
00:58:27,952 --> 00:58:29,644
But you can let go of the guilt.

725
00:58:31,715 --> 00:58:33,026
She wants you to live, Harlan.

726
00:58:34,338 --> 00:58:35,235
And you know that.

727
00:58:38,687 --> 00:58:41,759
You know what I've discovered
over the years of working
together?

728
00:58:42,173 --> 00:58:44,659
Is that home isn't a place.

729
00:58:44,969 --> 00:58:45,832
It's the people.

730
00:58:47,282 --> 00:58:48,801
It's what we have right here.

731
00:58:49,905 --> 00:58:50,768
Family.

732
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:53,219
And when you have family,

733
00:58:53,978 --> 00:58:54,979
you have no fear.

734
00:58:56,325 --> 00:58:58,155
You can handle
just about anything.

735
00:58:58,742 --> 00:58:59,915
Take our youngest, Ellis.

736
00:59:01,192 --> 00:59:02,711
I found you on the streets.

737
00:59:02,918 --> 00:59:03,747
Took you in.

738
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:05,645
Taught you everything.

739
00:59:07,233 --> 00:59:08,234
Yes, you're...

740
00:59:09,062 --> 00:59:11,030
you're still
a little young and wild.

741
00:59:12,272 --> 00:59:13,757
Misbehaving at times.

742
00:59:15,793 --> 00:59:19,279
But hey, that's
the privilege of youth.

743
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:24,284
But then again, loyalty is
expected even from
the cutest puppy.

744
00:59:26,114 --> 00:59:29,288
You can imagine my surprise when
I met that fag friend of yours

745
00:59:29,289 --> 00:59:31,084
in that shithole
village by the lake.

746
00:59:33,259 --> 00:59:34,605
What was his name, huh?

747
00:59:39,023 --> 00:59:39,955
Yes, Ethan.

748
00:59:42,199 --> 00:59:44,235
- Mr. Rhodes. I--
- Shh.

749
00:59:48,308 --> 00:59:49,655
After three fingers,

750
00:59:50,966 --> 00:59:53,106
he admitted that he was
here to steal the money.

751
00:59:53,831 --> 00:59:54,694
From us.

752
01:00:01,045 --> 01:00:02,806
After two more fingers,

753
01:00:04,393 --> 01:00:05,878
he told me that it was you.

754
01:00:06,844 --> 01:00:08,328
That you had planned this.

755
01:00:15,059 --> 01:00:15,922
Mr. Rhodes.

756
01:00:18,476 --> 01:00:21,893
This isn't what
it looks like. I'm sorry--

757
01:00:21,894 --> 01:00:22,791
Family.

758
01:00:23,481 --> 01:00:24,310
Should we forgive

759
01:00:25,276 --> 01:00:26,105
a misstep?

760
01:00:28,314 --> 01:00:29,314
Pen.

761
01:00:29,315 --> 01:00:30,281
What does your God say?

762
01:00:32,456 --> 01:00:34,665
Should one be
allowed to fail, to be weak?

763
01:00:35,493 --> 01:00:37,116
Isn't it truly divine

764
01:00:38,048 --> 01:00:38,980
to condone?

765
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:42,672
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

766
01:00:42,673 --> 01:00:43,777
Hey!

767
01:00:43,778 --> 01:00:44,641
It's all right.

768
01:00:45,193 --> 01:00:46,056
It's okay.

769
01:00:47,471 --> 01:00:48,437
I-I'm sorry.

770
01:00:55,824 --> 01:00:56,963
The answer is no.

771
01:00:58,482 --> 01:01:00,242
Mercy is weakness.

772
01:01:05,489 --> 01:01:07,146
And you're
a piece of shit, Ellis.

773
01:01:09,217 --> 01:01:10,355
You don't deserve to be part

774
01:01:10,356 --> 01:01:12,013
of this group of
wonderful people.

775
01:01:26,855 --> 01:01:28,270
Tomorrow we kill the warden.

776
01:01:28,892 --> 01:01:29,893
And then the poacher.

777
01:01:37,452 --> 01:01:38,418
They'll come to us.

778
01:01:40,006 --> 01:01:40,800
Don't you worry.

779
01:02:29,953 --> 01:02:32,024
You really know
your way around here.

780
01:02:32,887 --> 01:02:36,372
As a little girl, the elders
would teach us how to hunt out
in the woods.

781
01:02:36,373 --> 01:02:39,996
And we'd go back to the caves
and eat and sleep.

782
01:02:39,997 --> 01:02:41,515
You know, life was simple.

783
01:02:41,516 --> 01:02:43,551
I can't believe I never heard
about this place.

784
01:02:43,552 --> 01:02:44,553
Oz!

785
01:02:47,177 --> 01:02:48,281
You come with me.

786
01:02:52,976 --> 01:02:53,839
And you

787
01:02:54,874 --> 01:02:55,875
stay here.

788
01:02:59,914 --> 01:03:01,569
Him. He tried to kill her.

789
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:02,812
He killed her.

790
01:03:02,813 --> 01:03:04,124
No, he didn't.

791
01:03:04,125 --> 01:03:05,366
And then you take him
here to this secret spot?

792
01:03:05,367 --> 01:03:07,128
- I didn't mean to--
- It's on me to just--

793
01:03:08,336 --> 01:03:09,301
Is there a problem?

794
01:03:09,302 --> 01:03:10,200
Oz...

795
01:03:13,548 --> 01:03:15,032
They've been tracking us.

796
01:03:15,343 --> 01:03:16,446
He says he knows you.

797
01:03:16,447 --> 01:03:17,586
He doesn't like you.

798
01:03:18,622 --> 01:03:20,381
You dragged his niece
out of the community.

799
01:03:20,382 --> 01:03:22,556
- Took her to the city.
- That's not what happened.

800
01:03:22,557 --> 01:03:25,008
- Got her addicted to drugs.
- No, I-I-I--

801
01:03:27,113 --> 01:03:28,149
I-I told you, we--

802
01:03:29,150 --> 01:03:30,220
We lost our child.

803
01:03:32,084 --> 01:03:33,395
I watched Mia grow up.

804
01:03:34,672 --> 01:03:36,398
She was like family.
She was happy.

805
01:03:37,227 --> 01:03:39,400
But you,
you took her away.

806
01:03:39,401 --> 01:03:41,230
I didn't take her.
We loved each other.

807
01:03:41,231 --> 01:03:43,025
If it wasn't for you,
she'd still be alive.

808
01:03:43,026 --> 01:03:44,958
- Fuck you for saying that.
- Stop it.

809
01:03:44,959 --> 01:03:47,030
We do not have time for this.

810
01:03:47,962 --> 01:03:48,962
Oz,

811
01:03:48,963 --> 01:03:50,480
these people are chasing us.

812
01:03:50,481 --> 01:03:52,311
They're trying to
kill us. They shot Jed.

813
01:03:53,277 --> 01:03:54,969
You're kin. You have a duty.

814
01:03:59,111 --> 01:04:00,250
Not to him.

815
01:04:00,457 --> 01:04:02,045
He's my prisoner. He's with me.

816
01:04:06,187 --> 01:04:08,154
You and I share
the blood of our people.

817
01:04:09,293 --> 01:04:10,536
But when this is over...

818
01:04:15,161 --> 01:04:16,024
Come on.

819
01:04:21,167 --> 01:04:22,548
Our people believe

820
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,585
that spirits are in the
sky and in the wind.

821
01:04:26,414 --> 01:04:27,933
And under the water.

822
01:04:28,278 --> 01:04:30,107
Those are
the ones we fear the most.

823
01:04:32,523 --> 01:04:35,147
Hidden in the dark,
away from the sun,

824
01:04:36,355 --> 01:04:38,460
there's a dead
forest under this lake.

825
01:04:40,462 --> 01:04:43,638
Ten thousands years
ago before the Napikwan came.

826
01:04:44,259 --> 01:04:45,191
See that?

827
01:04:47,021 --> 01:04:50,127
It's methane. Explosive
gas in those bubbles.

828
01:04:51,197 --> 01:04:52,060
I, uh,

829
01:04:53,096 --> 01:04:54,304
think I'll go this way.

830
01:04:55,098 --> 01:04:56,064
So watch your step.

831
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:57,617
You stay close.

832
01:05:17,983 --> 01:05:18,707
What is this place?

833
01:05:19,363 --> 01:05:20,605
Ice shanties.

834
01:05:20,606 --> 01:05:22,125
They call it the Empty Quarter.

835
01:05:36,622 --> 01:05:38,417
I know you have licenses for
all this.

836
01:05:40,212 --> 01:05:41,213
It's our land.

837
01:05:43,732 --> 01:05:44,941
You know,

838
01:05:45,251 --> 01:05:47,288
my grandparents
asked me one time,

839
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:50,256
how many generations

840
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:54,743
does it take to lose
your connection with the land?

841
01:05:56,262 --> 01:05:57,643
After looking at you,

842
01:05:59,093 --> 01:06:00,438
I know the answer.

843
01:06:00,439 --> 01:06:02,993
Who are you to say
anything about my connection?

844
01:06:03,338 --> 01:06:05,443
You're a weekend tour guide.

845
01:06:05,444 --> 01:06:06,583
You sold out.

846
01:06:07,791 --> 01:06:09,654
I'm protecting our home.

847
01:06:09,655 --> 01:06:12,727
- I'm protecting what belongs to
all of us.
- Well you lost all of us.

848
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:16,661
Why don't you help yourself
to some food back there?

849
01:06:16,662 --> 01:06:18,319
Take all you want. We have lots.

850
01:06:19,147 --> 01:06:20,424
And get the hell out.

851
01:06:33,334 --> 01:06:34,300
So, um,

852
01:06:35,543 --> 01:06:36,371
where we going?

853
01:06:39,719 --> 01:06:40,997
Cleaning your mess.

854
01:06:54,838 --> 01:06:56,390
- There you are.
- Hey.

855
01:06:56,391 --> 01:06:57,565
This place.

856
01:06:58,359 --> 01:07:00,326
We could hide out here.
It's way off track.

857
01:07:01,638 --> 01:07:03,294
You know what they call us.

858
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:04,606
Sellout. Curse.

859
01:07:05,193 --> 01:07:06,367
They don't want us here.

860
01:07:07,816 --> 01:07:09,784
Listen, this
crew that's chasing us,

861
01:07:10,681 --> 01:07:12,372
they're after me because I know
where that plane is.

862
01:07:12,373 --> 01:07:14,271
There's no reason for
you to put yourself at risk.

863
01:07:14,858 --> 01:07:16,687
My land, my people,

864
01:07:17,205 --> 01:07:18,758
made a promise to protect them.

865
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:20,519
You're on my land, right?

866
01:07:21,623 --> 01:07:23,555
Besides, finally got reception.

867
01:07:23,556 --> 01:07:26,144
Sheriff Raleigh's on his way.
He's 15 minutes out.

868
01:07:26,145 --> 01:07:26,835
We're going home.

869
01:08:01,836 --> 01:08:02,699
Oz?

870
01:08:04,321 --> 01:08:05,219
I'm so sorry.

871
01:08:10,327 --> 01:08:12,467
We got some
unfinished business, aye, Chief.

872
01:08:13,848 --> 01:08:15,504
- Listen I-I wanna--
- How dare you

873
01:08:15,505 --> 01:08:18,508
bring your fucking
poison back here to my land?

874
01:08:21,476 --> 01:08:22,615
Listen, um--

875
01:08:23,754 --> 01:08:25,272
I want you to know that
the crew that's chasing us,

876
01:08:25,273 --> 01:08:29,242
they-they're looking for this
plane that's at the bottom of
the lake.

877
01:08:29,243 --> 01:08:30,313
It's filled with cash.

878
01:08:32,453 --> 01:08:35,834
Millions, probably. And they're
chasing us because I know where
it is but,

879
01:08:35,835 --> 01:08:37,216
I don't want that money.

880
01:08:38,976 --> 01:08:40,323
And I was thinking...

881
01:08:41,427 --> 01:08:44,189
You know, maybe you,
your people, Mia's tribe...

882
01:08:45,397 --> 01:08:46,260
maybe...

883
01:08:50,747 --> 01:08:51,748
So, uh...

884
01:08:53,784 --> 01:08:57,167
you think you can buy us off
and change your luck, hm?

885
01:08:59,583 --> 01:09:00,929
I'm not trying to pay you off.

886
01:09:02,621 --> 01:09:04,174
Trying to do something right.

887
01:09:10,456 --> 01:09:11,492
Ah, shit.

888
01:09:24,539 --> 01:09:25,609
Pen...

889
01:09:26,438 --> 01:09:28,612
life isn't like
a choo-choo train...

890
01:09:29,751 --> 01:09:32,685
where you can get off at any
station and then move on to
your own liking.

891
01:09:35,412 --> 01:09:38,450
My God wants us to
repent and be reborn.

892
01:09:40,831 --> 01:09:43,902
I had an interesting
conversation with Ellis about
that yesterday.

893
01:09:43,903 --> 01:09:45,249
About the

894
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:46,354
choices in life.

895
01:09:50,358 --> 01:09:52,670
I'd like to forego my share
of the money, Mr. Rhodes.

896
01:09:52,671 --> 01:09:53,705
No.

897
01:09:53,706 --> 01:09:54,844
Please. All I wanted--

898
01:09:54,845 --> 01:09:55,777
No.

899
01:09:57,469 --> 01:09:58,470
Ellis, I loved.

900
01:09:59,471 --> 01:10:00,299
You...

901
01:10:01,714 --> 01:10:02,646
I don't even like.

902
01:10:10,965 --> 01:10:13,795
Only God can forgive me or give
me the punishment I deserve.

903
01:10:15,728 --> 01:10:16,729
Well...

904
01:10:16,971 --> 01:10:18,386
whatever we have coming,

905
01:10:19,353 --> 01:10:20,285
it's coming fast.

906
01:10:24,910 --> 01:10:25,773
Oh,

907
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:27,913
Pen.

908
01:10:29,742 --> 01:10:30,640
Choo-choo!

909
01:10:44,378 --> 01:10:45,517
Jesus...

910
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:48,657
What happened here? I've
been looking all over for you.

911
01:10:48,658 --> 01:10:50,279
Five guys jumped us, they--

912
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:51,556
He play any role in this?

913
01:10:51,557 --> 01:10:54,076
- No, he helped. He helped.
- You sure?

914
01:10:54,077 --> 01:10:55,320
- Yeah, he helped me.
- Alright.

915
01:10:56,424 --> 01:10:58,494
Look, I called it in. Backup's
on the way. But we gotta go.

916
01:10:58,495 --> 01:10:59,531
Okay. How much backup?

917
01:11:00,048 --> 01:11:02,603
Enough.
So, where did it happen?

918
01:11:02,844 --> 01:11:04,811
They attacked out on
the middle-- -No, no, no.
I mean where is it?

919
01:11:04,812 --> 01:11:05,916
Where's what?

920
01:11:07,021 --> 01:11:08,712
Headquarters wants to
know where that plane is.

921
01:11:11,128 --> 01:11:12,716
How'd you know
there was a plane?

922
01:11:14,753 --> 01:11:16,064
You mentioned it when we

923
01:11:16,651 --> 01:11:18,032
were talking on the radio.

924
01:11:18,584 --> 01:11:19,620
Pretty sure I didn't.

925
01:11:26,558 --> 01:11:27,213
Listen to me.

926
01:11:29,388 --> 01:11:30,803
This is a very important moment.

927
01:11:31,356 --> 01:11:32,529
Alright?

928
01:11:33,841 --> 01:11:36,567
One that you're gonna look back
on years from now and realize

929
01:11:36,568 --> 01:11:39,467
how wise you are in telling
me exactly what I need to know.

930
01:11:39,778 --> 01:11:40,985
Not you, Raleigh...

931
01:11:40,986 --> 01:11:43,746
Come on, we can make
out real good here, Ani.

932
01:11:43,747 --> 01:11:46,024
This isn't like you.
Why are you doing this?

933
01:11:46,025 --> 01:11:49,512
Come on. It's
their money, Ani, just--

934
01:11:50,375 --> 01:11:52,100
We're giving
it back, for Crissakes.

935
01:11:52,618 --> 01:11:53,861
How much are they giving you?

936
01:11:56,139 --> 01:11:58,452
Five percent of
whatever's on that plane.

937
01:11:58,728 --> 01:12:01,695
Five percent. I'd
gladly split it with you.

938
01:12:01,696 --> 01:12:03,422
Yeah, if we give
them Harlan, right?

939
01:12:06,943 --> 01:12:08,047
You're such an asshole.

940
01:12:09,670 --> 01:12:11,327
Hey, hey, backup, backup!

941
01:12:11,568 --> 01:12:12,397
Give me the gun.

942
01:12:14,744 --> 01:12:16,918
- Stand down, Oz.
- I'm the sheriff, alright?

943
01:12:17,643 --> 01:12:19,126
Get in the goddamn
car, let's go!

944
01:12:19,127 --> 01:12:20,025
You too.

945
01:12:20,853 --> 01:12:21,682
Come on.

946
01:12:25,824 --> 01:12:26,928
Nobody try anything.

947
01:12:30,035 --> 01:12:30,898
Give me the bag.

948
01:12:31,623 --> 01:12:32,555
Give me the--

949
01:12:32,762 --> 01:12:33,590
Get in the car.

950
01:12:45,706 --> 01:12:47,949
There's nothing to worry
about here, all right?

951
01:12:48,225 --> 01:12:49,606
Everything's under control.

952
01:12:51,781 --> 01:12:52,782
It's gonna be okay.

953
01:13:03,102 --> 01:13:04,000
Where are we going?

954
01:13:06,174 --> 01:13:07,969
- Where's the plane?
- Fuck you, Raleigh.

955
01:13:17,979 --> 01:13:18,808
You good, man?

956
01:13:20,982 --> 01:13:22,398
Something take the edge off?

957
01:13:24,261 --> 01:13:25,608
Yo, man.

958
01:13:26,850 --> 01:13:28,749
It's methane, you idiot. You're
gonna blow the whole lake.

959
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:30,923
Methane?

960
01:13:33,098 --> 01:13:34,064
Hey, listen, man.

961
01:13:35,825 --> 01:13:37,171
After we get this money,

962
01:13:37,758 --> 01:13:39,069
everything will be all right.

963
01:13:44,937 --> 01:13:45,800
There.

964
01:13:54,119 --> 01:13:55,120
That's the sheriff.

965
01:13:56,949 --> 01:13:58,503
You got him to bring them here?

966
01:14:09,824 --> 01:14:10,618
Sheriff.

967
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:14,483
You realize
handing me over to them,

968
01:14:14,484 --> 01:14:16,555
you're giving up
millions of dollars.

969
01:14:17,073 --> 01:14:19,593
Why would you do that? I can
just take you to the plane.

970
01:14:28,602 --> 01:14:30,466
Okay. Where is it?

971
01:14:32,122 --> 01:14:34,158
I'm gonna need your word
that you're gonna let us go.

972
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:35,504
Yeah.

973
01:14:35,505 --> 01:14:36,713
Yeah, you have my word.

974
01:14:40,096 --> 01:14:41,994
I got a GPS
tracker in the backpack.

975
01:14:42,270 --> 01:14:43,788
It's got the coordinates in it.

976
01:14:43,789 --> 01:14:45,169
It's in the top pocket.

977
01:14:45,170 --> 01:14:46,482
If you're lying to me...

978
01:14:57,009 --> 01:14:58,045
Ahhhh!

979
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:14,613
Damn it!

980
01:15:36,221 --> 01:15:37,187
Ani, Ani?

981
01:15:43,987 --> 01:15:44,987
You okay?

982
01:15:44,988 --> 01:15:46,057
Yeah.

983
01:15:46,058 --> 01:15:47,163
- You okay?
- Fine.

984
01:15:47,370 --> 01:15:48,198
Look at me.

985
01:15:49,268 --> 01:15:50,131
Okay.

986
01:15:55,102 --> 01:15:56,034
Okay. Shh.

987
01:16:05,768 --> 01:16:06,976
Why'd you do this?

988
01:16:09,979 --> 01:16:11,048
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

989
01:16:11,049 --> 01:16:11,946
Back!

990
01:16:13,638 --> 01:16:14,603
Wait.

991
01:16:14,604 --> 01:16:15,709
You betrayed me, Ani.

992
01:16:16,882 --> 01:16:17,745
Sheriff.

993
01:16:19,333 --> 01:16:20,161
Hey.

994
01:16:20,921 --> 01:16:22,681
You don't want--

995
01:16:23,337 --> 01:16:25,856
No- Nobody...
Nobody's betrayed anyone.

996
01:16:25,857 --> 01:16:28,203
- This can't be serious.
- Don't do anything stupid.

997
01:16:28,204 --> 01:16:29,101
Why?

998
01:16:31,138 --> 01:16:33,692
Fuck! Fuck, come on. Come on.

999
01:16:36,039 --> 01:16:37,006
You shot the sheriff.

1000
01:16:37,834 --> 01:16:38,834
Poacher's mine.

1001
01:16:38,835 --> 01:16:39,698
Don't kill him!

1002
01:16:47,292 --> 01:16:48,224
Okay. Hey, stay down.

1003
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:19,012
Get the fuck over here.

1004
01:17:19,013 --> 01:17:19,911
Rhodes!

1005
01:17:21,844 --> 01:17:23,086
What do you want me to do?

1006
01:17:29,921 --> 01:17:30,852
You,

1007
01:17:30,853 --> 01:17:31,716
poacher,

1008
01:17:33,062 --> 01:17:34,028
lead us to the plane.

1009
01:17:35,478 --> 01:17:36,858
- Oh yeah?
- Now.

1010
01:17:36,859 --> 01:17:37,756
And Pen,

1011
01:17:40,794 --> 01:17:42,036
kindly dispose of the lady.

1012
01:17:44,970 --> 01:17:46,213
- But I thought that--
- Do it.

1013
01:17:53,945 --> 01:17:54,808
No.

1014
01:17:56,499 --> 01:17:57,742
Do your own dirty work.

1015
01:17:59,467 --> 01:18:00,952
The fuck, Pen?

1016
01:18:02,539 --> 01:18:04,300
You've killed over a hundred
people, and now your God won't
allow this one?

1017
01:18:09,305 --> 01:18:10,237
Fuck you, Rhodes.

1018
01:18:12,066 --> 01:18:12,929
Ah!

1019
01:18:26,494 --> 01:18:28,048
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!
- Rhodes!

1020
01:18:32,052 --> 01:18:33,363
There's a second chance.

1021
01:18:37,022 --> 01:18:38,023
There always is.

1022
01:18:42,131 --> 01:18:42,994
Ah!

1023
01:18:44,512 --> 01:18:45,512
Rhodes!

1024
01:18:45,513 --> 01:18:47,204
Your jacket! Your jacket!

1025
01:18:47,205 --> 01:18:48,413
Choo-choo.

1026
01:18:50,795 --> 01:18:51,933
Ah! Help!

1027
01:18:51,934 --> 01:18:53,797
Help! Ahh!

1028
01:18:53,798 --> 01:18:55,971
Ah! Ah!

1029
01:18:55,972 --> 01:18:56,904
Run!

1030
01:18:58,423 --> 01:19:01,150
Get on the ground, Rhodes!
Get on the ground!

1031
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:03,530
Ahh! Ahh!

1032
01:19:03,531 --> 01:19:04,429
Argh!

1033
01:19:05,430 --> 01:19:06,293
Harlan!

1034
01:19:07,501 --> 01:19:08,950
Ahhh!

1035
01:19:08,951 --> 01:19:09,951
Harlan!

1036
01:19:09,952 --> 01:19:11,505
- Ani?
- Ahhh!

1037
01:19:37,462 --> 01:19:38,359
Ani?

1038
01:19:44,987 --> 01:19:45,850
Poacher!

1039
01:19:47,127 --> 01:19:48,197
Poacher!

1040
01:19:56,377 --> 01:19:58,103
All you had to do

1041
01:19:58,932 --> 01:20:00,796
was tell us
where that plane was.

1042
01:20:02,867 --> 01:20:03,557
New deal.

1043
01:20:04,661 --> 01:20:05,835
You lead me there.

1044
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:08,458
And you both live.

1045
01:20:09,597 --> 01:20:10,529
You have my word.

1046
01:20:11,254 --> 01:20:12,152
Word of a killer.

1047
01:20:13,118 --> 01:20:14,085
Best I can do.

1048
01:20:16,087 --> 01:20:18,330
Now, where's my money?

1049
01:20:18,952 --> 01:20:19,883
Hmm?

1050
01:20:19,884 --> 01:20:21,540
Lady? Poacher?

1051
01:20:21,955 --> 01:20:23,852
J-J-Just let her go.

1052
01:20:23,853 --> 01:20:24,578
Mhm-hm.

1053
01:20:29,686 --> 01:20:31,446
- Left!
- Ah!

1054
01:20:31,447 --> 01:20:32,343
Wait, wait!

1055
01:20:34,105 --> 01:20:34,968
Ahh!

1056
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:36,590
Get up.

1057
01:20:37,384 --> 01:20:38,592
Get the fuck up.

1058
01:20:39,179 --> 01:20:40,456
- Wait. Listen.
- Look at him.

1059
01:20:41,457 --> 01:20:43,114
Fuckin' look at him!

1060
01:20:45,116 --> 01:20:47,118
Remember, he's
the one killing you.

1061
01:20:49,051 --> 01:20:51,053
- Not me.
- Y-you-you'll get what you want.

1062
01:20:51,536 --> 01:20:52,468
I-I'll show you!

1063
01:20:53,296 --> 01:20:54,641
Right!

1064
01:20:54,642 --> 01:20:55,540
Ah!

1065
01:20:57,093 --> 01:20:57,956
Ah!

1066
01:20:59,199 --> 01:21:00,131
Ugh!

1067
01:21:01,511 --> 01:21:02,374
Ugh!

1068
01:21:12,143 --> 01:21:13,109
The plane, poacher.

1069
01:21:15,111 --> 01:21:16,630
Where's the fucking plane?

1070
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:18,874
Fuck you.

1071
01:21:19,150 --> 01:21:20,116
Wrong answer.

1072
01:21:20,427 --> 01:21:21,392
Ugh!

1073
01:21:21,393 --> 01:21:22,291
Ah!

1074
01:21:50,526 --> 01:21:52,079
Last chance, poacher.

1075
01:21:54,219 --> 01:21:55,082
Where is it?

1076
01:21:58,603 --> 01:22:00,398
Where's the fucking plane?

1077
01:22:00,985 --> 01:22:02,089
Ughh!

1078
01:22:07,612 --> 01:22:08,509
Ah!

1079
01:23:40,291 --> 01:23:42,293
He's been out there on
his own for four days.

1080
01:23:44,571 --> 01:23:45,813
He's fasting.

1081
01:24:10,493 --> 01:24:12,149
Okay, Harlan.

1082
01:24:19,571 --> 01:24:21,642
It's okay to grieve.

1083
01:25:20,287 --> 01:25:21,530
Aaah!

1084
01:25:42,516 --> 01:25:43,862
<i>It's okay.</i>

1085
01:26:10,268 --> 01:26:11,821
I heard the Staties
found the plane.

1086
01:26:14,721 --> 01:26:16,171
Found four million dollars.

1087
01:26:18,656 --> 01:26:20,209
They were expecting 20 million.

1088
01:26:22,038 --> 01:26:23,247
That's a lot of money.

1089
01:26:25,904 --> 01:26:27,285
Did Harlan give it to you?

1090
01:26:30,461 --> 01:26:32,842
You know there's an
old saying that uh,

1091
01:26:33,602 --> 01:26:34,637
the earth

1092
01:26:35,673 --> 01:26:37,882
does not belong to man,

1093
01:26:38,676 --> 01:26:39,642
but man

1094
01:26:40,816 --> 01:26:42,473
belongs to the earth.

1095
01:26:43,025 --> 01:26:44,682
Hum. Aye.

1096
01:26:48,341 --> 01:26:49,445
That's a Facebook meme.

1097
01:26:51,620 --> 01:26:54,450
Where'd the money come from for
the new community hospital, Oz?

1098
01:26:55,624 --> 01:26:56,970
Oh, ice fishing.

1099
01:26:59,904 --> 01:27:01,561
You wanna see my license?

1100
01:27:06,324 --> 01:27:08,706
- And this?
- You gotta put this in here.

1101
01:27:09,085 --> 01:27:11,604
This. And then it's
gonna be in the water.

1102
01:27:11,605 --> 01:27:14,607
And the other fish is gonna
get it, on this reel. Okay?

1103
01:27:14,608 --> 01:27:15,644
And the yellow one?

1104
01:27:17,749 --> 01:27:18,578
Mommy, mommy!

1105
01:27:19,406 --> 01:27:20,614
Look what he gave me!

1106
01:27:21,305 --> 01:27:23,238
Look at all the different
baits he gave me!

1107
01:27:23,790 --> 01:27:24,653
You okay?

1108
01:27:27,897 --> 01:27:28,760
Yeah.

1109
01:27:32,005 --> 01:27:34,558
- Let's see what you got.
- So this red one is for
the big fish.

1110
01:27:34,559 --> 01:27:37,666
Oh boy! And this is for
the little fish? That's great!

1111
01:27:38,494 --> 01:27:40,771
- The blue is for the small ones.
- Oh, yeah.

1112
01:27:40,772 --> 01:27:43,015
Can I go fishing
with Harlan sometimes?

1113
01:27:43,016 --> 01:27:44,499
Is Harlan teaching you
the right way to do it?

1114
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:45,570
Please Mom, please!

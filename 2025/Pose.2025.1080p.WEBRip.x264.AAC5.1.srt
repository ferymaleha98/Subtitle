3
00:04:49,071 --> 00:04:51,682
You know, I know you
said it was remote,

4
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:53,989
but I didn't realize you
meant "no reception" remote.

5
00:04:55,817 --> 00:04:56,644
Wow.

6
00:04:58,559 --> 00:04:59,299
I got it.

7
00:05:05,174 --> 00:05:05,957
Thank you.

8
00:05:09,874 --> 00:05:10,397
This is it.

9
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:20,320
This place is
perfect. Oh my God.

10
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,105
I've seen, I've seen this
place in so many photographs.

11
00:05:23,192 --> 00:05:26,891
It's, I mean, what are
we doing here?

12
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,980
Thomas Alexander is everywhere.

13
00:05:29,067 --> 00:05:30,591
It's nice.

14
00:05:30,678 --> 00:05:32,244
He owns this place.

15
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,595
The affairs, the artistry, the,

16
00:05:35,987 --> 00:05:36,553
this tree.

17
00:05:38,294 --> 00:05:41,558
We're going to take the
perfect photograph here. Wow.

18
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:45,693
Well?

19
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:52,874
It's just the two of us now.

20
00:06:01,143 --> 00:06:02,840
Oh, wow.

21
00:06:02,927 --> 00:06:04,451
Ooh.

22
00:06:04,538 --> 00:06:06,714
Oh, this is, I think
this is a Japanese tree.

23
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:08,542
Oh, is this, is
this what you pictured

24
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:10,761
when you were
booking this place?

25
00:06:12,154 --> 00:06:14,678
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, yeah.

26
00:06:14,765 --> 00:06:16,985
It's, you know, it's exactly,

27
00:06:17,072 --> 00:06:19,335
it's exactly the vibe we're
looking for, you know?

28
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:21,337
Nobody will expect you in this-

29
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:23,600
- Okay.
- genre. It's...

30
00:06:23,687 --> 00:06:26,255
You think we can do
a good job on this one?

31
00:06:26,342 --> 00:06:27,952
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

32
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:29,998
Yeah.

33
00:06:30,085 --> 00:06:32,914
What you need to do is trust
me and stop stressing so much.

34
00:06:33,001 --> 00:06:33,871
- I am s-
- You need

35
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,786
to accept this process.

36
00:06:35,873 --> 00:06:37,440
No, I'm stressed because I
don't know what the plan is.

37
00:06:37,527 --> 00:06:39,050
Peter, I need you to
tell me what the plan is,

38
00:06:39,137 --> 00:06:40,530
because I am nervous.

39
00:06:40,617 --> 00:06:41,966
I am the plan.

40
00:06:42,053 --> 00:06:43,881
For my album cover.
You're the plan?

41
00:06:45,796 --> 00:06:47,363
Stop stressing
about this, please.

42
00:06:51,106 --> 00:06:51,672
Oh my God.

43
00:07:07,035 --> 00:07:07,688
This is...

44
00:07:11,256 --> 00:07:11,866
What? What is it?

45
00:07:11,953 --> 00:07:13,302
Tell me.

46
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:15,783
This is, this is basically

47
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,046
where Thomas
Alexander took this...

48
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:22,311
- Bit rainier?
- This is, this is where he,

49
00:07:23,704 --> 00:07:25,270
this is, this is
"Abbey Road" for me.

50
00:07:25,357 --> 00:07:27,229
This is, this wall.

51
00:07:28,404 --> 00:07:29,492
This is gonna be-

52
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:30,362
Be the perfect album cover?

53
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,494
- Yeah.
- Okay.

54
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:32,887
Yes!

55
00:07:32,974 --> 00:07:34,454
You're so cute
when you're excited.

56
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,368
It's the perfect place.

57
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,457
This is gonna be perfect.

58
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,423
Come!

59
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,860
It's just gonna be us
and Dolly here, right?

60
00:07:49,947 --> 00:07:50,992
Yeah.

61
00:08:08,357 --> 00:08:09,663
You love to be soggy.

62
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,882
Then I'm gonna
have to kill you.

63
00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:13,057
Oh!

64
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:27,289
He needs
mouth-to-mouth!

65
00:08:34,426 --> 00:08:35,558
- Hey.
- Mm-hmm?

66
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:37,081
I love you. I do.

67
00:08:41,608 --> 00:08:43,740
So how would you shoot me?

68
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:55,143
Well.

69
00:08:58,102 --> 00:09:01,149
There's this famous picture

70
00:09:01,236 --> 00:09:02,759
that Thomas Alexander took

71
00:09:02,846 --> 00:09:05,719
with this redheaded
woman floating...

72
00:09:09,374 --> 00:09:11,507
So do I inspire you?

73
00:09:11,594 --> 00:09:13,248
Or does Thomas Alexander?

74
00:09:13,335 --> 00:09:14,597
You do inspire me.

75
00:09:14,684 --> 00:09:15,946
I might as well not be here.

76
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:17,557
You do inspire me.

77
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:51,025
Are you sure you, you,
you packed those clothes?

78
00:09:51,112 --> 00:09:53,288
Yes, I packed my
own clothes, Peter.

79
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,029
No, but are you,
are you sure you packed

80
00:09:55,116 --> 00:09:57,379
those outfits you're
talking about?

81
00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:59,816
Yes. Well, the, the ones
we chose for the shoot.

82
00:09:59,903 --> 00:10:01,383
It happens
all the time...

83
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,167
Oh, for the shoots?
You don't have them?

84
00:10:03,254 --> 00:10:05,866
I know. I know I
packed them this morning.

85
00:10:05,953 --> 00:10:07,345
Because basically
back in the days,

86
00:10:07,694 --> 00:10:09,913
kings and queens used to
come here and just, just like

87
00:10:11,175 --> 00:10:12,350
have orgies-
- Orgies and stuff like that.

88
00:10:12,437 --> 00:10:14,265
- and stuff like that.
- Yeah.

89
00:10:14,352 --> 00:10:16,224
And so they, they would
write their names on windows.

90
00:10:16,311 --> 00:10:17,442
- On the windows?
- Yeah.

91
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:19,619
I really think
that someone is,

92
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:21,011
someone is watching us

93
00:10:21,098 --> 00:10:21,925
or following us-
- Nobody's watching us.

94
00:10:22,012 --> 00:10:23,840
It's like that.

95
00:10:23,927 --> 00:10:25,276
It's happened before. So why
couldn't that happen again?

96
00:10:25,363 --> 00:10:26,887
Okay, I packed my
bags this morning

97
00:10:26,974 --> 00:10:29,629
and there is, there is
someone watching us.

98
00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:31,239
There's
no one watching you.

99
00:10:32,936 --> 00:10:35,460
I'm here to manage you.
Not mother you, Patricia.

100
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,334
Okay. So there
are people here.

101
00:10:39,421 --> 00:10:40,770
Dolly, what the hell?

102
00:10:40,857 --> 00:10:41,684
I thought we had
this for the weekend.

103
00:10:41,771 --> 00:10:43,164
You know who that was?

104
00:10:43,251 --> 00:10:44,818
That was Thomas Alexander.
- Mm-hmm.

105
00:10:44,905 --> 00:10:46,602
The greatest photographer

106
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:48,299
of all time.
- Of all time.

107
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,298
Who's her?

108
00:12:14,385 --> 00:12:17,040
Hey, hey,
hey, hey. No, no, no.

109
00:12:25,353 --> 00:12:26,876
You must take you with me.

110
00:12:26,963 --> 00:12:28,399
Don't leave me alone.
- We have some friends,

111
00:12:28,486 --> 00:12:29,531
We have some friends
to go and see, love.

112
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:30,706
We have to be alone.

113
00:12:32,186 --> 00:12:34,754
- Can you leave it?
- Who's her?

114
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,627
- Don't worry about her.
- No, no, no, no, no.

115
00:12:38,714 --> 00:12:41,325
Don't take, don't
take, don't take.

116
00:12:43,197 --> 00:12:43,806
You stay.

117
00:12:45,068 --> 00:12:46,069
You stay there.

118
00:12:48,028 --> 00:12:49,899
- I'm gonna bite you.
- Fucking.

119
00:12:49,986 --> 00:12:51,422
I'm gonna bite you
if you don't take me.

120
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:52,728
- You f-
- Hey?

121
00:12:56,384 --> 00:12:57,559
Hey.
- Don't, don't, don't, don't.

122
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:38,948
I'm sorry for, uh,

123
00:13:43,518 --> 00:13:45,172
sorry for earlier.

124
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:52,135
I didn't mean to, um, stare.

125
00:13:52,222 --> 00:13:53,180
I'm a photographer. I...

126
00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:09,849
Um, I'm sorry.

127
00:14:16,072 --> 00:14:16,856
I love your work.

128
00:14:23,688 --> 00:14:25,473
Peter and Patricia.

129
00:14:27,736 --> 00:14:28,302
- Patricia.
- Hi.

130
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:29,956
I'm Thomas.

131
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:33,263
You hair is fucking beautiful.

132
00:14:34,743 --> 00:14:35,526
Thank you.

133
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,231
Okay, I, um, I don't know
what's happening here,

134
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:48,409
but, um, I'm really
sorry that we're here.

135
00:14:48,496 --> 00:14:50,759
Clearly there was some
sort of misunderstanding.

136
00:14:52,717 --> 00:14:54,850
Dolly had said that the house
was ours for the weekend.

137
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:57,026
And then clearly we've
just come into your space

138
00:14:57,113 --> 00:14:58,767
and very much
invaded your privacy.

139
00:14:58,854 --> 00:15:02,858
So, I'm sorry. We should go.

140
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:04,294
Why would you leave?

141
00:15:04,381 --> 00:15:06,166
Plenty of bedrooms.
There's room.

142
00:15:09,734 --> 00:15:11,606
- Oh...
- Hey guys. This is Jemima.

143
00:15:11,693 --> 00:15:13,173
- Hi.
- Hey, Jemima.

144
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,740
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm Patricia.

145
00:15:15,827 --> 00:15:16,916
- Hi.
- Hi.

146
00:15:18,178 --> 00:15:18,918
Oh, you play.

147
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,921
- Do I play?
- Yeah. You like playing?

148
00:15:22,008 --> 00:15:23,574
I, yeah. I play sometimes.

149
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:24,401
- Yeah?
- Hmm.

150
00:15:24,488 --> 00:15:24,967
Which play?

151
00:15:26,273 --> 00:15:27,491
Which kind of play?
- I, uh...

152
00:15:28,753 --> 00:15:29,537
You want?

153
00:15:32,322 --> 00:15:35,108
Yeah. Yeah.

154
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:40,852
Whoa.

155
00:15:42,811 --> 00:15:44,508
I, I...

156
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:45,901
- You don't wanna play?
- You should play.

157
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:47,555
- That was lovely.
- Hmm?

158
00:15:47,642 --> 00:15:48,948
-  You should play.
- No, keep playing.

159
00:15:55,432 --> 00:15:55,955
Five of us

160
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,396
in a house with three bedrooms.

161
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,184
I think we've got space.

162
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:14,756
Honestly, Jemima came all
the way from Paris, guys.

163
00:16:14,843 --> 00:16:16,236
- Yeah.
- I think

164
00:16:16,323 --> 00:16:18,455
we felt a little bit threatened.

165
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:21,241
I apologize for coming
down aggressively.

166
00:16:21,328 --> 00:16:22,677
We'll get outta
your hair tomorrow

167
00:16:22,764 --> 00:16:24,070
and you guys can
shoot your album.

168
00:16:28,857 --> 00:16:29,945
- Thank you.
- Yeah?

169
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:31,381
- Yes. Yeah.
- Thank you.

170
00:16:35,342 --> 00:16:36,430
They're gonna stay.

171
00:16:36,517 --> 00:16:37,561
I mean, they're gonna stay.

172
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,000
- Thank you, Dolly.
- Mm.

173
00:16:42,131 --> 00:16:42,914
Quite the show.

174
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:46,179
You think?

175
00:16:48,181 --> 00:16:51,401
I haven't done anything like
this since back in our day.

176
00:16:51,488 --> 00:16:53,708
I can't kind of believe it.

177
00:16:56,232 --> 00:16:57,494
Shall I fuck with you?

178
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,932
Would you like that?

179
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,803
Yeah.

180
00:17:04,197 --> 00:17:08,853
Like it's 2004.

181
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,860
I'm the one in control here.

182
00:17:18,341 --> 00:17:19,038
Okay.

183
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:30,614
It's okay.

184
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:35,793
I got you.

185
00:17:41,364 --> 00:17:42,061
Thank you.

186
00:17:43,236 --> 00:17:44,498
Thank you, Dolly.

187
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,284
You're welcome, Thomas.

188
00:18:01,993 --> 00:18:03,647
Can you play music?

189
00:18:03,734 --> 00:18:05,606
Yeah. I'm, I mean, yeah.

190
00:18:05,693 --> 00:18:06,781
I'm, I'm a singer

191
00:18:06,868 --> 00:18:08,261
and I write music.
- Yeah?

192
00:18:08,348 --> 00:18:09,914
Singer/song writer,
I guess. Yeah.

193
00:18:10,001 --> 00:18:11,655
- That's amazing.
- It's what do. Yeah.

194
00:18:11,742 --> 00:18:13,092
Yeah.

195
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:14,571
Well, I would love
to have a band,

196
00:18:14,658 --> 00:18:16,225
like be there and let you fly.

197
00:18:16,312 --> 00:18:17,748
I think he is one of-

198
00:18:17,835 --> 00:18:19,185
- I mean, I-
- the most amazing things.

199
00:18:19,272 --> 00:18:20,273
Yeah. I mean,
that's the best part.

200
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,404
You know, I would love to...

201
00:18:33,764 --> 00:18:37,072
Yeah, I guess I would just love
to play to bigger audiences

202
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:38,682
and move more people.

203
00:18:38,769 --> 00:18:39,379
I mean, that's really why...

204
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:49,389
- Yeah.
- Amazing. It is beautiful.

205
00:18:49,476 --> 00:18:51,304
- Thank you.
- Yeah. You're amazing.

206
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:53,480
-  Stop.
-  Really.

207
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,439
Um, what, what do
you, what do you do?

208
00:19:14,283 --> 00:19:15,676
I know what I want to do,

209
00:19:15,763 --> 00:19:17,504
but I, I feel like
I'm being pulled

210
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:20,159
in so many different
directions and it just, um, so.

211
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:23,901
I think art is super
complicated thing

212
00:19:23,988 --> 00:19:25,294
and it's something that

213
00:19:27,122 --> 00:19:28,863
you never know what's
right, you know?

214
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,953
Like, like-
- Yeah.

215
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,565
you have to be, like,
exploring all the time.

216
00:19:35,652 --> 00:19:39,265
And it's like maybe
in your business,

217
00:19:39,352 --> 00:19:42,224
like people want to,
to know the truth,

218
00:19:42,311 --> 00:19:44,574
but the truth is fake, you know?

219
00:19:44,661 --> 00:19:46,141
It is not any true.

220
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:48,361
And you have to
be like exploring

221
00:19:48,448 --> 00:19:50,319
and discovering it by yourself

222
00:19:50,406 --> 00:19:51,102
and doing-
- Thank you.

223
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,539
what you feel.

224
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:54,671
Fuck the people, you know?

225
00:19:54,758 --> 00:19:57,587
But you are with Peter,
you are a couple?

226
00:19:57,674 --> 00:20:00,547
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- Okay. Okay.

227
00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:02,026
I do believe that he
knows what he's doing,

228
00:20:02,113 --> 00:20:03,463
but I really had to fight

229
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,899
for him to get
this job, you know?

230
00:20:04,986 --> 00:20:07,206
And he's just so
obsessed with Thomas.

231
00:20:07,293 --> 00:20:08,990
I mean,

232
00:20:16,127 --> 00:20:17,346
he's so talented
and he really knows

233
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:18,956
what he, he could do,

234
00:20:19,043 --> 00:20:22,482
but he just, he's just
completely consumed

235
00:20:22,569 --> 00:20:24,223
with the idea of being
like Thomas and I...

236
00:20:32,187 --> 00:20:35,146
I don't know.

237
00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:51,250
- Hey.
- Hi.

238
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,259
You ready to call it a day?

239
00:21:04,045 --> 00:21:06,526
- Yeah, mine was pretty...
- Have you been crying, baby?

240
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,442
- No.
- Are you okay?

241
00:21:11,574 --> 00:21:13,968
I don't know how
to feel around them.

242
00:21:14,055 --> 00:21:15,535
What do you mean?

243
00:21:15,622 --> 00:21:17,928
- Jemima's so-
- So what?

244
00:21:21,105 --> 00:21:24,283
- Sexy, and-
- And you're not?

245
00:21:26,589 --> 00:21:30,245
And Thomas has like
this creative energy

246
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:31,942
that you're obsessed with

247
00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:34,728
and I don't really know
what I'm doing with my...

248
00:21:34,815 --> 00:21:36,817
You don't have to
worry. I have good ideas.

249
00:21:36,904 --> 00:21:37,687
Yeah?

250
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,211
Really good ideas.

251
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,648
I, I found my inspiration.

252
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:47,784
Yeah.

253
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:50,309
What's your inspiration?

254
00:21:51,788 --> 00:21:52,354
You.

255
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,315
That's a good answer.

256
00:22:07,238 --> 00:22:08,327
You're amazing.

257
00:22:11,068 --> 00:22:12,418
I haven't been a- ama- amazing

258
00:22:18,598 --> 00:22:20,339
for quite some
time, so thank you.

259
00:22:22,036 --> 00:22:23,037
Do you know,

260
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:28,564
do you know my picture,
"Strangers on the Bridge"?

261
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:33,308
After that picture came
out, everything changed.

262
00:22:34,701 --> 00:22:37,443
And for the longest
time after it,

263
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,706
everything was amazing.

264
00:22:45,886 --> 00:22:47,366
But it doesn't last,
whatever, you know?

265
00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:53,154
It does end.

266
00:22:57,941 --> 00:22:59,029
She ended.

267
00:23:03,164 --> 00:23:05,384
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

268
00:23:07,603 --> 00:23:09,170
But you've gotta fight
against that, you know?

269
00:23:09,257 --> 00:23:13,392
You've gotta fight
against those thoughts.

270
00:23:15,611 --> 00:23:19,398
I think if you let people in,

271
00:23:22,488 --> 00:23:26,579
might be a chance,
a second chance.

272
00:23:30,191 --> 00:23:34,674
I want to take a picture

273
00:23:38,242 --> 00:23:39,766
that nobody can ever take away.

274
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:46,903
And when I take
it, this weekend,

275
00:23:48,905 --> 00:23:50,124
I want you there.

276
00:23:52,213 --> 00:23:54,345
I wanna be there.

277
00:24:04,921 --> 00:24:07,271
- The house, you like?
- Yeah.

278
00:24:07,358 --> 00:24:09,230
- Yeah?
- I do. Yeah.

279
00:24:09,317 --> 00:24:10,666
In which part do
you want to take the photo?

280
00:24:10,753 --> 00:24:12,755
Yeah, I mean, I,
I had some ideas,

281
00:24:12,842 --> 00:24:14,365
but I'm gonna leave
that to Peter.

282
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:18,500
He's gonna feel it.

283
00:24:18,587 --> 00:24:21,547
Listen, for every
a hundred thousand fans,

284
00:24:21,634 --> 00:24:23,897
there's probably one stalker,

285
00:24:23,984 --> 00:24:25,899
one that's a little
bit of a wrong'un.

286
00:24:25,986 --> 00:24:27,335
Do you know what's really
frustrating about this, Dolly?

287
00:24:27,422 --> 00:24:30,773
Is that I chose you

288
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,949
because you were a woman
in a position of power

289
00:24:33,036 --> 00:24:33,602
and you were great.
- And I accepted.

290
00:24:33,689 --> 00:24:35,299
Yes.

291
00:24:35,386 --> 00:24:36,431
And you know, we got on
really well and everything

292
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:37,998
and you're great at your job,

293
00:24:38,085 --> 00:24:39,129
but you make me feel
like the crazy woman

294
00:24:39,216 --> 00:24:40,261
that people complain about.

295
00:24:40,348 --> 00:24:42,829
You work like to help her?

296
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:44,961
- Yes. Like an agent.
- Because you had a-

297
00:24:45,048 --> 00:24:45,832
SK&R.

298
00:24:47,703 --> 00:24:49,096
I'm gonna say it, okay?

299
00:24:49,183 --> 00:24:51,272
You are kind of pressing her.
- Yeah.

300
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:52,752
I'm
pressing her, am I?

301
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:54,188
I don't know if
even that's the word

302
00:24:54,275 --> 00:24:55,537
but, you know?
- Sometimes to succeed,

303
00:24:55,624 --> 00:24:56,407
Jemima, you need
a bit of pressure.

304
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,321
Yeah. You think?

305
00:24:57,408 --> 00:24:58,409
- Yes!
- Yeah.

306
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,150
You think that if you want

307
00:25:00,237 --> 00:25:03,763
to someone be like in their
best, you have to press?

308
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,373
I don't know actually
now why you took me on,

309
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,592
because my first
album was solid.

310
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:08,071
I was really proud of it.

311
00:25:08,158 --> 00:25:09,072
It was so artistic.

312
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:10,509
And now you're pushing

313
00:25:10,596 --> 00:25:12,032
this flimsy bullshit.
- Okay. Alright.

314
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:12,989
We're doing finger
pointing now, are we?

315
00:25:13,076 --> 00:25:14,121
It's my, it's my fault?

316
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:15,252
I just want you to support me.

317
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:16,515
I do nothing but support you.

318
00:25:16,602 --> 00:25:17,646
What are we doing here?
- Mm.

319
00:25:17,733 --> 00:25:19,518
I'm gonna go get ready.

320
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:27,351
Do you like to be
with Thomas here?

321
00:25:29,092 --> 00:25:32,487
Look, Peter wanted to
take Patricia's photo here.

322
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:34,533
He was very intent
on it being here.

323
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,622
He had the visions
for his photo,

324
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:38,885
so he came and I did not know

325
00:25:38,972 --> 00:25:39,973
that Thomas was gonna be here.

326
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,235
I really didn't.

327
00:25:41,322 --> 00:25:43,367
- How long?
- How long...?

328
00:25:43,454 --> 00:25:44,586
Yeah, like since when?

329
00:25:44,673 --> 00:25:46,109
Oh. I see.

330
00:25:46,196 --> 00:25:49,678
You know, oh, you
know, 20, 20 odd years.

331
00:25:49,765 --> 00:25:51,462
- Wow.
- Yeah.

332
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,639
You know, we were
both on the scene

333
00:25:53,726 --> 00:25:55,771
in the, in the noughties-
- Uh-huh.

334
00:25:55,858 --> 00:25:58,252
Just sort
of partying and stuff.

335
00:25:58,339 --> 00:26:00,297
We're just party, party friends.

336
00:26:00,384 --> 00:26:02,473
Yeah.

337
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,911
And you did a lot of
crazy things too, eh.

338
00:26:04,998 --> 00:26:06,477
We did. Yeah.

339
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:09,829
We, we had a nice time. Yeah.

340
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:12,527
And how do
you feel here with him?

341
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:14,703
I feel fine. I feel fine.

342
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,965
Thanks, Jemima.

343
00:26:16,052 --> 00:26:17,488
- Yeah?
- No, no.

344
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,708
We're not really in,
in touch anymore.

345
00:26:19,795 --> 00:26:22,537
I'm more concerned
with, uh, Patricia

346
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:24,583
and harnessing her talent.

347
00:26:25,671 --> 00:26:27,020
Do you like art?

348
00:26:28,761 --> 00:26:29,936
Do I like art? Of course.

349
00:26:30,023 --> 00:26:30,589
It's my job.

350
00:26:32,112 --> 00:26:35,942
You have like
amazing eyes, but,

351
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,339
I don't know, it's, it's
like sadness on them.

352
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:45,647
It's like I feel

353
00:26:47,518 --> 00:26:48,607
sadness in your eyes.

354
00:27:05,101 --> 00:27:06,320
Peter.

355
00:27:06,407 --> 00:27:08,975
Peter, get up.

356
00:27:09,062 --> 00:27:10,933
I really wanna just
get started today

357
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,066
so that we can get
the hell out of here.

358
00:27:13,153 --> 00:27:14,284
Okay?

359
00:28:02,768 --> 00:28:05,727
So this is interesting
in terms of, uh.

360
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:16,651
No. That doesn't work.

361
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:18,522
Let's change

362
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:19,610
What's wrong with this one
if you've got it already?

363
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:20,568
There's nothing wrong with it.

364
00:28:20,655 --> 00:28:21,482
It's just not good.

365
00:28:26,008 --> 00:28:27,270
I'm trying.

366
00:28:27,357 --> 00:28:28,402
'Cause this is a
white background,

367
00:28:28,489 --> 00:28:29,969
this is a white background.

368
00:28:30,056 --> 00:28:31,492
I love that-
- Yeah, but that background-

369
00:28:31,579 --> 00:28:32,275
we came here to end up
with a white background.

370
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,544
T- tell me exactly what it
is that you need from me.

371
00:28:40,631 --> 00:28:41,807
What is wrong with this picture?

372
00:28:45,332 --> 00:28:47,247
Okay, so let's, let's,
let's try it, okay?

373
00:28:47,334 --> 00:28:48,727
Okay. Yeah.

374
00:28:48,814 --> 00:28:49,945
- You're with me?
- Yeah.

375
00:28:50,032 --> 00:28:51,251
- I'm with you.
- I'm with you.

376
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:32,248
Okay, now look at me as if
you're about to proposed to me.

377
00:29:34,947 --> 00:29:35,774
What do you mean by that?

378
00:29:46,523 --> 00:29:47,220
Are you proposing?

379
00:29:52,181 --> 00:29:52,791
Maybe.

380
00:29:55,228 --> 00:29:57,534
I'm not asking, but if I did,

381
00:29:58,666 --> 00:29:59,580
what would you say?

382
00:30:02,452 --> 00:30:03,018
Maybe.

383
00:30:05,629 --> 00:30:06,195
But I do.

384
00:30:09,198 --> 00:30:11,461
I think there are things you
need to know about me first.

385
00:30:11,548 --> 00:30:12,506
About what?

386
00:30:17,598 --> 00:30:18,947
Well, do you think

387
00:30:19,034 --> 00:30:19,600
that you would
wanna have a family?

388
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:24,605
Like babies?

389
00:30:32,221 --> 00:30:33,614
Oh, wow.

390
00:30:33,701 --> 00:30:34,702
So, before you go.

391
00:30:39,011 --> 00:30:40,360
He should not put this to you.

392
00:30:41,578 --> 00:30:42,144
Steal it.

393
00:31:00,771 --> 00:31:03,774
I think maybe it's
not a good idea.

394
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:07,387
And I think maybe
we don't do it.

395
00:31:08,649 --> 00:31:09,824
- Um.
- Maybe.

396
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:12,522
I went to bed so sure.

397
00:31:12,609 --> 00:31:14,394
And maybe we don't do it.

398
00:31:14,481 --> 00:31:15,612
Listen, listen.

399
00:31:15,699 --> 00:31:16,526
Hey. Don't you-
- They're really

400
00:31:16,613 --> 00:31:17,484
just young people,

401
00:31:17,571 --> 00:31:19,094
they're really nice,

402
00:31:19,181 --> 00:31:20,574
they're really normal
and I don't know if-

403
00:31:20,661 --> 00:31:21,880
And you're gonna
take a great photo.

404
00:31:24,317 --> 00:31:26,493
We're not terminating,
we're doing this.

405
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,147
I'm not having you
walk out again.

406
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:31,454
We're doing it.

407
00:31:31,541 --> 00:31:32,151
It's just a picture, isn't it?

408
00:31:32,238 --> 00:31:32,891
Is it?

409
00:31:34,457 --> 00:31:35,241
Is it?

410
00:31:37,286 --> 00:31:40,202
I think we're gonna do this
and it's gonna be all right.

411
00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:42,335
All I've done is just
pictures for the last 10 years.

412
00:31:42,422 --> 00:31:45,947
This is why we're gonna do
this and it's gonna feel good.

413
00:31:46,034 --> 00:31:47,731
We used to really
believe in this stuff.

414
00:31:48,645 --> 00:31:49,429
Remember?

415
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:55,435
We used to spend so
much time building this

416
00:31:55,522 --> 00:31:57,698
and working at this
to make ourselves feel

417
00:31:57,785 --> 00:31:59,569
like we were doing something
that meant something.

418
00:31:59,656 --> 00:32:02,268
And I thought I could make

419
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,054
real things out of no things.

420
00:32:07,838 --> 00:32:09,362
Models and fucking pop stars

421
00:32:09,449 --> 00:32:13,279
and actors and
people in the street

422
00:32:13,366 --> 00:32:15,020
that meant nothing.

423
00:32:15,107 --> 00:32:16,891
And we made them something.
- I know.

424
00:32:19,285 --> 00:32:21,940
I don't know if I
can still do that.

425
00:32:24,116 --> 00:32:25,639
You can.

426
00:32:25,726 --> 00:32:26,596
And she's really good.

427
00:32:27,902 --> 00:32:28,511
And it's worth it.

428
00:32:30,035 --> 00:32:30,818
What is this?

429
00:32:32,341 --> 00:32:35,562
This is more than a picture.

430
00:32:38,304 --> 00:32:40,480
This means something.

431
00:32:43,396 --> 00:32:43,962
Right?

432
00:32:47,139 --> 00:32:48,575
I have to think it is true.

433
00:32:48,662 --> 00:32:51,360
Because if,

434
00:32:51,447 --> 00:32:53,275
because, because if it isn't,

435
00:32:53,362 --> 00:32:54,624
I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life

436
00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:55,974
just looking at that photograph.

437
00:32:57,192 --> 00:32:58,454
Of her?

438
00:32:59,629 --> 00:33:00,761
Of my whole world.

439
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,768
And if I think that that
is more than a photograph,

440
00:33:07,855 --> 00:33:08,551
I'm gonna live in it

441
00:33:11,815 --> 00:33:13,600
and never come out.

442
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:21,173
And I need to get out of it.

443
00:33:23,175 --> 00:33:24,176
I've got children

444
00:33:24,263 --> 00:33:25,742
and I've got family

445
00:33:28,658 --> 00:33:29,485
and I've got,

446
00:33:32,532 --> 00:33:34,142
people if I want 'em.

447
00:33:34,229 --> 00:33:37,058
But I need to get out

448
00:33:37,145 --> 00:33:42,020
of that fucking photograph.

449
00:33:47,199 --> 00:33:48,548
I just want to
do something good.

450
00:33:50,289 --> 00:33:51,812
And I need you for that.

451
00:33:53,509 --> 00:33:54,815
Just do this for me, please.

452
00:34:01,865 --> 00:34:05,956
Okay.

453
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:09,699
Please don't jump ship. Again.

454
00:34:15,488 --> 00:34:17,751
- Where have you been?
- Where have I been?

455
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:19,187
Where have I been?

456
00:34:20,623 --> 00:34:22,625
You know, around.

457
00:34:22,712 --> 00:34:25,150
- Have you been okay?
- What do you think?

458
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:28,414
That
you're always okay.

459
00:34:28,501 --> 00:34:30,068
Okay, great. Then
I'm always okay.

460
00:34:51,567 --> 00:34:53,787
It is fine. It's fine.

461
00:34:53,874 --> 00:34:54,440
It's fine.

462
00:34:59,401 --> 00:35:02,012
Thomas, you broke my heart.

463
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:05,668
You really broke it.

464
00:35:16,201 --> 00:35:17,289
I'm the one in control here.

465
00:35:19,943 --> 00:35:20,727
Okay.

466
00:35:36,003 --> 00:35:37,439
Do you ever get the feeling

467
00:35:37,526 --> 00:35:39,833
that you're being
watched in this house?

468
00:35:41,704 --> 00:35:43,402
We're all being watched
all the time, man.

469
00:35:56,893 --> 00:36:00,462
Did anyone die in here?

470
00:36:00,549 --> 00:36:01,159
Yeah.

471
00:36:03,552 --> 00:36:04,466
What happened?

472
00:36:06,642 --> 00:36:09,384
They let her out of
the hospital so she
could die at home.

473
00:36:28,621 --> 00:36:31,145
Truth is just a pill
sugar coated in a lie.

474
00:37:26,331 --> 00:37:30,552
-  Fucking hell.
- Hey there.

475
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:31,988
- Alright?
- Fuck's sake.

476
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,515
You're such a creep
lurking in my room.

477
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,605
You want me
lurking in your room.

478
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,869
Don't you want me
lurking in your room?

479
00:37:54,663 --> 00:37:55,403
Do you want a bump?

480
00:37:57,536 --> 00:37:58,276
Yeah.

481
00:38:10,157 --> 00:38:12,377
Mm.

482
00:38:15,205 --> 00:38:19,122
Eight years of bad s- sex.

483
00:38:19,209 --> 00:38:21,168
Another eight years.

484
00:38:21,255 --> 00:38:24,258
You've been
having bad sex for eight years?

485
00:38:24,345 --> 00:38:26,434
- Just no sex.
- I don't believe that.

486
00:38:26,521 --> 00:38:28,262
I don't think you're
telling me the truth.

487
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,526
You know,

488
00:38:34,573 --> 00:38:37,924
I wasn't upset that
you lied to me.

489
00:38:38,011 --> 00:38:38,577
Mm-hmm.

490
00:38:40,492 --> 00:38:42,450
I was upset that I could
never fucking trust you again.

491
00:38:47,455 --> 00:38:48,630
And you were scared.

492
00:38:52,852 --> 00:38:54,157
You were scared that you'd lost

493
00:38:54,244 --> 00:38:55,811
the only person that
believed in you.

494
00:39:07,475 --> 00:39:08,346
Do you know what you did?

495
00:39:12,611 --> 00:39:13,351
What did I do?

496
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:20,009
You supported me and you,

497
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:26,146
you kept telling me
I was still an artist

498
00:39:26,233 --> 00:39:27,365
when I wasn't anymore.

499
00:39:32,413 --> 00:39:34,850
Well, I loved you.

500
00:39:34,937 --> 00:39:36,286
That's what you do
if you love someone,

501
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,853
you support them no matter what.

502
00:39:43,685 --> 00:39:44,904
It's not very
truthful, isn't it?

503
00:39:44,991 --> 00:39:45,557
Mm-hmm.

504
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:50,431
- The truth will set you free.
- Will it?

505
00:39:50,518 --> 00:39:52,390
Yeah. But not until
it's fucked you right up.

506
00:39:57,307 --> 00:39:58,396
How are your nightmares?

507
00:39:59,832 --> 00:40:02,225
They've started
to be about dying.

508
00:40:05,707 --> 00:40:08,536
I don't know what comes next.

509
00:40:11,887 --> 00:40:14,455
And what if there's nothing?

510
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,284
Isn't that a relief?

511
00:40:18,241 --> 00:40:19,025
Maybe.

512
00:40:20,766 --> 00:40:22,898
Kate's in the back, we've
got Naomi in the back,

513
00:40:22,985 --> 00:40:24,987
she's in the middle and
I'm driving up the front

514
00:40:25,074 --> 00:40:27,207
and we still have not got
this picture all day long.

515
00:40:27,294 --> 00:40:29,296
Right? We have not
captured anything.

516
00:40:29,383 --> 00:40:31,690
It's a redundant
piece of imagery.

517
00:40:31,777 --> 00:40:33,387
That's all we have.

518
00:40:33,474 --> 00:40:35,998
And I just yank the
steering wheel to the left

519
00:40:36,085 --> 00:40:37,522
and we slam into
the back of the van.

520
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:41,047
I get flung to the
right of the golf buggy.

521
00:40:41,134 --> 00:40:42,875
Naomi is in the back.

522
00:40:42,962 --> 00:40:46,269
She somehow managed to fly
over the middle, over her,

523
00:40:46,356 --> 00:40:48,010
and when I look up,

524
00:40:48,097 --> 00:40:51,057
Naomi's sitting in the front
with her knees bleeding.

525
00:40:51,144 --> 00:40:54,277
Kate is on the floor and you
are completely outta sight.

526
00:40:54,364 --> 00:40:55,844
And that's the picture
that you've seen

527
00:40:55,931 --> 00:40:58,978
and that's the picture
that some people loved.

528
00:40:59,065 --> 00:41:01,850
And honestly, I think
we'd spent two days

529
00:41:01,937 --> 00:41:03,765
trying to get that image.

530
00:41:03,852 --> 00:41:06,725
And all we needed to do was
crash a fucking golf buggy.

531
00:41:06,812 --> 00:41:10,511
For me, that was a
slice of something real

532
00:41:10,598 --> 00:41:12,078
because they were damaged

533
00:41:12,165 --> 00:41:13,819
and they were hurt
and they were shocked.

534
00:41:13,906 --> 00:41:14,472
I don't know why.

535
00:41:16,386 --> 00:41:17,953
I don't know why.

536
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,215
What do you think
makes a good picture?

537
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,267
Uh, truth.

538
00:41:27,354 --> 00:41:29,791
- Okay.
- Timing,

539
00:41:31,053 --> 00:41:33,186
I would say.
- Mm-hmm.

540
00:41:33,273 --> 00:41:36,972
Uh, I don't know, it's

541
00:41:38,278 --> 00:41:39,061
I don't know much.

542
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,981
This much is
true. There we are.

543
00:41:47,374 --> 00:41:50,508
What do you think
it is about you

544
00:41:50,595 --> 00:41:52,422
that makes you a photographer?

545
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,120
Yeah, like, why?

546
00:41:54,207 --> 00:41:55,817
What is it about you that
makes you want to do it?

547
00:41:55,904 --> 00:41:57,253
Where does the
passion come from?

548
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,038
I think my, my eye.

549
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:02,171
Just a perception,
perception on life.

550
00:42:02,258 --> 00:42:03,999
You think you're special?

551
00:42:05,218 --> 00:42:07,046
No.

552
00:42:07,133 --> 00:42:08,613
You think you see things
that other people don't see.

553
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,615
I think everybody is
special in, in that way.

554
00:42:10,702 --> 00:42:13,226
- No, they're not.
- Thanks, Dolly.

555
00:42:17,012 --> 00:42:18,231
Listen, I'm
sorry for yesterday.

556
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:19,754
- No.
- No.

557
00:42:19,841 --> 00:42:21,408
No. It's all good.

558
00:42:21,495 --> 00:42:22,583
I, I know, I know, I
know, I know, I know.

559
00:42:24,106 --> 00:42:28,633
You, you made me want
to be a photographer

560
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,506
and then everything about
you is a, is a wonder.

561
00:42:32,593 --> 00:42:35,944
I just, I didn't
mean to intrude or...

562
00:42:38,164 --> 00:42:39,861
It's okay.

563
00:42:39,948 --> 00:42:41,994
I have been, gonna take
some responsibility here,

564
00:42:42,081 --> 00:42:45,127
I have been an
absolute todger to you

565
00:42:45,214 --> 00:42:50,045
and it is not something
that I wish to be anymore.

566
00:42:50,132 --> 00:42:52,744
So thank you for
saying that, Peter.

567
00:42:52,831 --> 00:42:55,529
I really, really appreciate
it and I appreciate you

568
00:42:55,616 --> 00:42:59,054
and I think you being
here is important

569
00:42:59,141 --> 00:43:01,622
and I think all of us
being here is important.

570
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:05,583
It's gonna be important.

571
00:43:09,456 --> 00:43:10,762
You okay?

572
00:43:10,849 --> 00:43:12,024
I'm sorry. Sorry.

573
00:43:12,111 --> 00:43:15,418
I'm so sorry. It's all a ruse.

574
00:43:15,505 --> 00:43:17,725
- Whoa.
- See, I knew

575
00:43:17,812 --> 00:43:19,858
that your beloved Thomas
was gonna be here.

576
00:43:19,945 --> 00:43:22,295
- Whoa. Whoa!
- I was going to show up.

577
00:43:22,382 --> 00:43:23,992
It's all been-
- Dolly.

578
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:25,385
it's all a game.

579
00:43:25,472 --> 00:43:26,168
Did you steal
all my clothes too?

580
00:43:26,255 --> 00:43:27,866
I did.

581
00:43:27,953 --> 00:43:29,737
I thought I could
trust you, but...

582
00:43:29,824 --> 00:43:31,913
- Dolly.
- Yes, Dearest.

583
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,003
I think you should
share with the group.

584
00:43:36,744 --> 00:43:39,486
Thank you very much for
talking me off a ledge

585
00:43:39,573 --> 00:43:41,314
and then putting me back on it.

586
00:43:41,401 --> 00:43:45,579
My name's Thomas and I'm
afraid of taking a photograph.

587
00:43:47,233 --> 00:43:49,191
Hi, Thomas.

588
00:43:49,278 --> 00:43:51,411
Hi, Dolly, you fucking dick.

589
00:43:57,765 --> 00:43:59,071
I've watched you
for a long time.

590
00:44:00,463 --> 00:44:02,944
I've listened to
you for a long time

591
00:44:03,031 --> 00:44:05,643
and you've touched
me for the first time

592
00:44:09,951 --> 00:44:10,648
in a very long time.

593
00:44:13,346 --> 00:44:14,652
You need something this weekend,

594
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:19,395
I need something this weekend.

595
00:44:20,788 --> 00:44:22,050
Please, let me
take your picture.

596
00:44:22,137 --> 00:44:23,617
Let me take your picture

597
00:44:23,704 --> 00:44:25,271
because otherwise
it's just fucking pop.

598
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:30,450
And I know you don't want that.

599
00:44:32,104 --> 00:44:33,105
I'm gonna take your picture.
- Oh my God.

600
00:44:33,192 --> 00:44:35,020
Look at me, in a minute,

601
00:44:35,107 --> 00:44:36,674
I am going to take
your fucking picture.

602
00:44:37,762 --> 00:44:38,545
Let him.

603
00:44:40,155 --> 00:44:41,766
I know you want him to
take your photograph.

604
00:44:41,853 --> 00:44:44,682
Not our lovely friend here.

605
00:44:44,769 --> 00:44:46,031
- Our lovely friend?
- Mm-hmm.

606
00:44:46,118 --> 00:44:47,815
Don't be a bitch.

607
00:44:47,902 --> 00:44:49,208
Am I being a bitch
or am I being honest?

608
00:44:49,295 --> 00:44:51,819
- Oh.
- You're a fucking liar.

609
00:44:51,906 --> 00:44:53,168
So where was your
offering, Peter?

610
00:44:53,255 --> 00:44:54,213
Where was your offering?

611
00:44:55,388 --> 00:44:56,868
I'm sorry, Dolly.

612
00:44:56,955 --> 00:44:57,956
Does this make you
feel important, yeah?

613
00:44:58,043 --> 00:44:59,479
Does it make you feel fulfilled?

614
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,437
I am not here to facilitate

615
00:45:01,524 --> 00:45:03,352
whatever the fuck is going
on between you and Thomas.

616
00:45:03,439 --> 00:45:05,050
You know what's
wrong with you two?

617
00:45:05,137 --> 00:45:07,705
With your little circus
and your little backstory

618
00:45:07,792 --> 00:45:09,271
and we kiss, we
fuck, we disappear,

619
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:11,230
we come back, we
play with people.

620
00:45:11,317 --> 00:45:13,362
You think you, you think you
can toy with people like that?

621
00:45:13,449 --> 00:45:14,450
Because your miserable-
- Oh, I like it.

622
00:45:14,537 --> 00:45:16,017
existence feels so empty

623
00:45:16,104 --> 00:45:18,890
that you have to
play with people.

624
00:45:18,977 --> 00:45:20,108
Why are you so obsessed
with him? It's weird.

625
00:45:20,195 --> 00:45:21,675
- I'm obsessed with him-
- Why?

626
00:45:21,762 --> 00:45:23,068
because I've been
admiring him for years.

627
00:45:23,155 --> 00:45:24,199
And I was probably wrong.

628
00:45:24,286 --> 00:45:25,287
You know what? Fuck you two.

629
00:45:25,374 --> 00:45:26,636
No, no, no, no. Come on.

630
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,377
No, no, no, no, no. I'm-

631
00:45:28,464 --> 00:45:29,596
You're right.

632
00:45:29,683 --> 00:45:31,554
You are right. You are right.

633
00:45:31,641 --> 00:45:33,469
- Don't patronize me, man.
- No, I'm not.

634
00:45:33,556 --> 00:45:35,080
Actually, I think you've said

635
00:45:35,167 --> 00:45:36,951
the first honest thing
I've heard you say.

636
00:45:37,038 --> 00:45:40,215
- Who do you think you are?
- Let me take your picture.

637
00:45:40,302 --> 00:45:41,521
- Hey, look at me.
- Let me take your picture.

638
00:45:41,608 --> 00:45:42,696
Thomas.

639
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,219
- I'm sorry, but-
- What?

640
00:45:44,306 --> 00:45:46,134
what fricking high
horse are you on?

641
00:45:46,221 --> 00:45:48,180
Why do you think I
need your help, Thomas?

642
00:45:48,267 --> 00:45:49,790
I don't need you here.

643
00:45:49,877 --> 00:45:50,878
I don't need you here, Thomas.
- I don't care.

644
00:45:50,965 --> 00:45:52,793
I don't need you here, Dolly.

645
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,362
I'm sorry, tell me what you
have done that I need from you.

646
00:45:56,449 --> 00:45:58,059
- Will you let me-
- We're not,

647
00:45:58,146 --> 00:45:59,234
we're not children, okay?
- I understand that.

648
00:45:59,321 --> 00:46:00,018
- Yeah-
- I understand that.

649
00:46:00,105 --> 00:46:01,584

00:53:20,501 --> 00:53:21,198
Can I?

714
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:25,506
Come. Come here.

715
00:55:55,961 --> 00:55:57,528
Alejandro. Alejandro.

716
00:56:02,446 --> 00:56:06,711
I'm Thomas fucking Ale-

717
00:56:19,767 --> 00:56:20,899
I will see you
around, man. Okay?

718
00:56:20,986 --> 00:56:22,379
We'll see you later.

719
00:56:32,998 --> 00:56:34,434
But I need you

720
00:56:34,521 --> 00:56:35,566
to stop being such
an asshole to Peter.

721
00:56:35,653 --> 00:56:36,915
Okay? He's a good guy.

722
00:56:37,002 --> 00:56:38,525
- Okay.
- He's a good guy

723
00:56:38,612 --> 00:56:40,222
and he's done nothing to
deserve your behavior.

724
00:56:41,441 --> 00:56:42,703
We'll
talk about that.

725
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:45,271
Oh,
please enlighten me.

726
00:56:45,358 --> 00:56:49,493
Bad art should
be punishable by jail time.

727
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:51,799
He should be doing
a lifetime stretch.

728
00:56:51,886 --> 00:56:53,410
I think it might be a crime

729
00:56:53,497 --> 00:56:55,063
to hold a camera when
you're that untalented.

730
00:56:56,761 --> 00:56:59,241
Jesus. You and you Jemima.

731
00:56:59,328 --> 00:57:00,982
I don't wanna fight, okay?

732
00:57:01,069 --> 00:57:02,941
I, we have been doing
enough of that this weekend.

733
00:57:07,685 --> 00:57:09,774
I know people probably
put you on a pedestal.

734
00:57:09,861 --> 00:57:11,515
I know what that feels like

735
00:57:11,602 --> 00:57:13,517
and I know what it feels
like to not live up to that.

736
00:57:13,604 --> 00:57:16,737
And I get that that's
frustrating and
can make you angry.

737
00:57:16,824 --> 00:57:19,610
But, fuck, you cast a lot
of aspersions on this one.

738
00:57:19,697 --> 00:57:21,350
He is so nervous

739
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:24,658
and he has tried to learn
from you this weekend

740
00:57:24,745 --> 00:57:26,399
and glean something from you

741
00:57:26,486 --> 00:57:29,358
and you just, putting him
down, humiliating him.

742
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:30,185
It's too easy for you.

743
00:57:30,272 --> 00:57:31,273
It's small.

744
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,451
You are so like her.

745
00:57:38,063 --> 00:57:38,585
Like who?

746
00:57:40,892 --> 00:57:41,458
My person.

747
00:57:51,032 --> 00:57:51,642
Yeah, Thomas, I,

748
00:57:56,211 --> 00:57:56,777
I am not,

749
00:57:59,693 --> 00:58:00,738
I'm not your person.

750
00:58:03,175 --> 00:58:04,959
And-
- Yeah.

751
00:58:05,046 --> 00:58:08,441
I'm sorry that you
experienced such a huge loss.

752
00:58:08,528 --> 00:58:09,268
I am. I really am.

753
00:58:09,355 --> 00:58:11,052
But I,

754
00:58:14,665 --> 00:58:16,493
I think you just
projected things onto me.

755
00:58:18,016 --> 00:58:19,757
I'm a pop star who
dies her hair red.

756
00:58:25,937 --> 00:58:27,199
I know.

757
00:58:27,286 --> 00:58:30,245
I mean, hearing
it back from you,

758
00:58:30,332 --> 00:58:33,379
it does actually sound really,

759
00:58:33,466 --> 00:58:36,077
um, crazy.

760
00:58:39,167 --> 00:58:40,647
I think I thought that

761
00:58:41,822 --> 00:58:44,433
you could be with me

762
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:45,957
if I'm being really honest,

763
00:58:48,873 --> 00:58:50,178
because she was
everything to me.

764
00:58:52,441 --> 00:58:53,312
I'm not your person.

765
00:58:54,574 --> 00:58:55,836
Yeah. It's not me.

766
00:58:56,968 --> 00:58:59,405
Okay. Okay.

767
00:58:59,492 --> 00:59:01,102
I think I see that.
- Mm.

768
00:59:05,498 --> 00:59:06,586
You are not my person.

769
00:59:10,285 --> 00:59:10,982
I'm really sorry.

770
00:59:12,374 --> 00:59:13,724
I've acted very
strangely. I know that.

771
00:59:14,942 --> 00:59:16,422
And it must be quite frightening

772
00:59:18,032 --> 00:59:19,556
and I'm not gonna fuck
with you guys anymore.

773
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:23,864
But I am really glad
you're still here.

774
01:00:14,001 --> 01:00:16,787
You don't need to
do this. Not now.

775
01:00:21,705 --> 01:00:23,054
You know. Not now.

776
01:00:27,885 --> 01:00:29,626
You know? Don't do it.

777
01:01:32,036 --> 01:01:32,689

784

Does it satisfy you?

785
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,108
You don't have a drink.

01:02:01,195 --> 01:02:03,458
- Champagne.
- Coming right up.

787
01:02:05,591 --> 01:02:07,419
This house has chaotic energy.

788
01:02:09,508 --> 01:02:11,162
This, madam, is for you.

789
01:02:11,249 --> 01:02:12,554
Thank you.

790
01:02:12,641 --> 01:02:13,860
How, how long have
you been here?

791
01:02:13,947 --> 01:02:14,774
Here for five years.

792
01:02:16,907 --> 01:02:18,082
What brought you to it?

793
01:02:18,169 --> 01:02:19,736
I bought it with a woman.

794
01:02:19,823 --> 01:02:22,303
We were going to transform
it and renovate it

795
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:24,610
and that didn't happen.

796
01:02:24,697 --> 01:02:27,526
And the renovation
didn't happen.

797
01:02:27,613 --> 01:02:28,832
Get the
sad violin out guys.

798
01:02:28,919 --> 01:02:30,572
Can you hear it?

799
01:02:30,659 --> 01:02:33,532
Can you?

800
01:02:33,619 --> 01:02:34,838
It's the tiniest violin.

801
01:02:36,535 --> 01:02:40,060
He doesn't
think so. You fucker.

802
01:02:40,147 --> 01:02:41,496
Jesus Christ.

803
01:02:41,583 --> 01:02:43,107
So what are we
getting up to tonight?

804
01:02:43,194 --> 01:02:46,110
You tell me. You guys
showed up unannounced.

805
01:02:46,197 --> 01:02:48,199
I'm assuming Dolly
called you guys, right?

806
01:02:48,286 --> 01:02:49,940
- We just came.
- We just came.

807
01:02:50,027 --> 01:02:51,680
We were just walking
through the forest casually

808
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,378
and we just called.

809
01:02:53,465 --> 01:02:54,945
Little helpers, little
elves from the forest

810
01:02:55,032 --> 01:02:56,294
come to help you.

811
01:02:56,381 --> 01:02:58,165
Your hiking gear
is really chic.

812
01:02:58,252 --> 01:03:01,212
Mm. Mm.

813
01:03:01,299 --> 01:03:02,779
So what have we been
doing last nights?

814
01:03:04,911 --> 01:03:06,173
We've been working
on something.

815
01:03:07,871 --> 01:03:09,829
Well, we've be making something.

816
01:03:09,916 --> 01:03:14,225
- Can we help?
- You three.

817
01:03:15,661 --> 01:03:18,142
You happy three.

818
01:03:19,317 --> 01:03:19,839
You three.

819
01:03:22,494 --> 01:03:25,540
You band of fuckers.
- I told you guys.

820
01:03:25,627 --> 01:03:27,020
You know. You know.

821
01:03:28,413 --> 01:03:29,631
You fucking know.

822
01:03:31,024 --> 01:03:34,114
We're gonna help you.

823
01:03:35,594 --> 01:03:37,901
Oh wow. Look, the
princess is here.

824
01:03:37,988 --> 01:03:39,903
- Ah.
- Woo!

825
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:41,992
This is our queen.

826
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:44,385
Queen for the night.
- Looking good.

827
01:03:44,472 --> 01:03:45,560
- Cheers.
- Looking beautiful.

828
01:03:45,647 --> 01:03:46,910
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

829
01:03:46,997 --> 01:03:48,868
- Cheers and beers.
- Cheers.

830
01:03:54,656 --> 01:03:56,484
Um, I don't like to,

831
01:03:58,182 --> 01:03:59,183
I don't often get, uh,

832
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:03,448
I'm a great admirer.

833
01:04:04,971 --> 01:04:06,625
- Of?
- Your work.

834
01:04:06,712 --> 01:04:07,713
- Okay.
- No.

835
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:09,497
- Thank you.
- No.

836
01:04:09,584 --> 01:04:12,413
Thank you so much.
It's nice to meet you.

837
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:13,850
You got
a fan, Patricia.

838
01:04:16,156 --> 01:04:17,941
Sorry. How do you know Thomas?

839
01:04:18,028 --> 01:04:18,985
- Hmm.
- All of you?

840
01:04:20,204 --> 01:04:21,683
- Oh, we just...
- We just came.

841
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:22,641
Who invited you?

842
01:04:37,177 --> 01:04:39,266
By the way, I
have one request.

843
01:04:42,356 --> 01:04:44,881
At some point,
whenever you feel it,

844
01:04:46,621 --> 01:04:48,145
I'd really love to hear you.

845
01:04:48,232 --> 01:04:51,800
Uh, well,
I would like to wait

846
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,150
for Peter to get here.
- Yes.

847
01:04:53,237 --> 01:04:54,107
Is
she gonna perform?

848
01:04:54,194 --> 01:04:55,587
Why do you need Peter?

849
01:04:55,674 --> 01:04:56,893
Oh,
you've gotta perform.

850
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:57,284
- Because?
- It's your voice.

851
01:04:58,590 --> 01:04:59,417
- Please.
-  Please.

852
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:03,595
- Okay, I'm gonna just-
- Come on.

853
01:05:03,682 --> 01:05:04,596
We wanna hear you sing.

854
01:05:38,064 --> 01:05:38,847
Where were you?

855
01:05:42,851 --> 01:05:44,331
I was, uh, outside.

856
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:47,900
With Jemima?

857
01:05:52,644 --> 01:05:53,384
Listen, I, I,

858
01:05:54,733 --> 01:05:55,777
I heard you guys,

859
01:05:56,996 --> 01:05:59,172
I was looking for you and I,

860
01:05:59,259 --> 01:06:00,086
I heard what you said.

861
01:06:05,526 --> 01:06:07,050
And, and it's okay.

862
01:06:07,137 --> 01:06:08,834
I know I'm not the greatest,

863
01:06:08,921 --> 01:06:11,010
most talented photographer
you've ever seen, but,

864
01:06:15,406 --> 01:06:15,972
I see you.

865
01:06:18,017 --> 01:06:20,019
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

866
01:06:21,716 --> 01:06:22,369
And I love you.

867
01:06:28,288 --> 01:06:29,376
That's all I care about.

868
01:06:32,075 --> 01:06:33,337
I don't, I don't care

869
01:06:33,424 --> 01:06:35,121
about any of the
rest of the stuff.

870
01:06:37,863 --> 01:06:38,864
That's all I care about.

871
01:06:40,518 --> 01:06:41,127
I love you too.

872
01:06:55,315 --> 01:06:59,493
I'm actually gonna
play an old song

873
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:03,323
and, um, it makes
more sense to me now

874
01:07:03,410 --> 01:07:04,411

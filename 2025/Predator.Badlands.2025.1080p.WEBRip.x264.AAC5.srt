Fm Movie

3
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:46,958
I sense you, brother.

4
00:02:52,917 --> 00:02:54,250
Hiding...

5
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,333
...behind your cloak.

6
00:03:01,792 --> 00:03:04,083
It is time to earn yours.

7
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,792
Still too small to take me head on.

8
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,042
Use the cave!

9
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:35,125
You fight with rage.

10
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,333
I fight like father.

11
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,792
You are not father, you are Dek!

12
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,792
Do you yield?

13
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,083
Never!

14
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,125
Good.

15
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,625
I'm still alive, brother.

16
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:15,041
Still much to prove...

17
00:05:15,042 --> 00:05:17,625
...to show who you are.

18
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,583
I am Yautja.

19
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,208
Not yet.

20
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,792
Are you holding your sword, Kwei?

21
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:31,667
No.

22
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,042
Pick it up!

23
00:06:02,542 --> 00:06:05,000
You kept this toy?!

24
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,333
You remember what happened...

25
00:06:09,292 --> 00:06:12,208
I lost my fang!

26
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,667
And you saved my life.

27
00:06:17,417 --> 00:06:20,000
You protected me.

28
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:21,958
Come here.

29
00:06:30,042 --> 00:06:32,125
Fixed it for you.

30
00:06:35,417 --> 00:06:37,708
Don't blow yourself up.

31
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,583
Today you make a vow...

32
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:59,250
...as our ancestors did before you.

33
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,000
To earn your place in the clan...

34
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,625
...you must choose your prey.

35
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,125
Bring it home...

36
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:13,000
...or never return.

37
00:07:20,542 --> 00:07:22,417
Wait - Go back!

38
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,167
Genna.

39
00:07:28,542 --> 00:07:30,667
The death planet.

40
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:35,542
Home of the un-killable Kalisk.

41
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,958
Even father fears it.

42
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:46,333
Then the Kalisk shall be my trophy.

43
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,458
Father calls me the weakest...

44
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:53,750
...so I must kill the strongest.

45
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,250
Failure means death.

46
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:02,000
Then I will not fail.

47
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,792
I cannot allow it.

48
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,417
I make my vow.

49
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,542
I make my vow!

50
00:09:11,042 --> 00:09:11,875
Father.

51
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:16,875
I welcome you with honor.

52
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,875
Why is it not done?

53
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:35,292
He deserves a hunt.

54
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:40,083
He is our clan's weakness<i>...</i>

55
00:09:41,417 --> 00:09:43,792
...weakness must be culled.

56
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:47,792
He will bring home the Kalisk.

57
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,374
Foolishness.

58
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,500
He is a runt.

59
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,875
You should have done it as he slept.

60
00:09:58,583 --> 00:09:59,667
Kill him!

61
00:10:00,542 --> 00:10:01,375
Now!

62
00:10:11,792 --> 00:10:14,708
He will only honor us in death.

63
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,750
Father.

64
00:10:44,167 --> 00:10:45,667
Kwei?

65
00:10:46,542 --> 00:10:48,958
Be brave, brother.

66
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,042
Father!

67
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,625
Kwei!!!

68
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:08,042
To forgive weakness...

69
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:11,917
...is to show weakness.

70
00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:15,708
No! Father, no!

71
00:12:23,792 --> 00:12:25,500
Get your sword!

72
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:29,792
Kwei!!!

73
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,917
<i>Launch sequence initiated.</i>

74
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:58,542
Bring it home.

75
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:02,833
Bring it home.

76
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,375
For Kwei.

77
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:07,708
Yautja hunt alone.

78
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:35,375
What happened to your legs?

79
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:26,000
You have seen the Kalisk?

80
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:16,249
Useful...

81
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,958
like tool?

82
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:40,583
I will use you, tool.

83
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,583
Don't want flies.

84
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:32,375
Name is Dek.

85
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:35,167
Now talk that way.

86
00:30:09,458 --> 00:30:12,167
How long have you been here?

87
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:35,750
Who would come?

88
00:30:50,708 --> 00:30:53,583
Sensitivity is weakness.

89
00:33:58,667 --> 00:34:00,958
I must eat.

90
00:34:13,458 --> 00:34:15,500
What is this creature?

91
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:24,833
Then it will be my food, too.

92
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:34,958
Quiet tool!

93
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:51,042
You give up too easily.

94
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,500
Kalisk?

95
00:38:49,042 --> 00:38:50,917
You give up too easily.

96
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:18,042
When I pierced its head with my sword,

97
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:22,208
and its blood rushed down my face.

98
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,333
This flesh is not sweet.

99
00:42:12,083 --> 00:42:14,417
I have no clan!

100
00:42:18,667 --> 00:42:20,417
No clan.

101
00:42:26,708 --> 00:42:29,708
I had a brother.

102
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:41,292
Father killed him.

103
00:42:47,125 --> 00:42:49,792
Grief is weakness.

104
00:42:56,292 --> 00:42:59,625
I am here for Kalisk.

105
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:04,500
Why are you here?

106
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:22,667
You should be able to survive on your own.

107
00:43:34,833 --> 00:43:37,958
Tessa is your sister.

108
00:44:08,333 --> 00:44:09,833
And legs.

109
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:14,792
Find your sister.

110
00:44:15,833 --> 00:44:17,708
And legs.

111
00:47:40,667 --> 00:47:41,708
The sun rises.

112
00:47:42,625 --> 00:47:43,792
Let's go.

113
00:47:51,125 --> 00:47:53,500
Yautja hunt alone.

114
00:47:58,833 --> 00:48:00,333
You're a tool.

115
00:48:10,792 --> 00:48:14,375
We're not in the tree now.

116
00:49:09,792 --> 00:49:11,875
Kalisk?

117
00:49:17,417 --> 00:49:19,208
It drinks here.

118
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:23,750
It drinks here?

119
00:49:26,875 --> 00:49:30,958
You are a useless tool if you don't speak.

120
00:49:57,542 --> 00:50:00,417
My brother was protecting me.

121
00:50:05,667 --> 00:50:09,000
The clan can have no weakness.

122
00:50:10,208 --> 00:50:12,750
I will show them strength.

123
00:50:38,042 --> 00:50:39,832
Wolf.

124
00:50:39,833 --> 00:50:42,958
This alpha must be a great killer.

125
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:46,125
I will hunt it too.

126
00:50:58,917 --> 00:51:00,583
I see...

127
00:51:02,875 --> 00:51:07,125
But I will be the alpha
that kills the most.

128
00:51:41,625 --> 00:51:43,458
The Kalisk's den?

129
00:52:11,875 --> 00:52:13,708
Who are they?

130
00:53:12,208 --> 00:53:13,917
Easier to walk now.

131
00:53:16,875 --> 00:53:17,708
No.

132
00:53:18,292 --> 00:53:20,667
Easier for me to walk now.

133
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:39,375
I too will remember this...

134
00:53:39,708 --> 00:53:43,583
today I become Dek of the Yautja.

135
00:53:44,333 --> 00:53:47,167
I will honor Kwei...

136
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:52,042
when I bring the Kalisk home.

137
00:53:54,083 --> 00:53:57,375
Then I taste revenge.

138
00:53:58,875 --> 00:54:02,333
You will be the first to see my trophy.

139
00:54:04,167 --> 00:54:06,125
It is a great honor.

140
00:54:07,208 --> 00:54:08,667
For you.

141
00:54:19,042 --> 00:54:19,875
What?

142
00:54:25,083 --> 00:54:28,083
I came here for the Kalisk.

143
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,417
You want my trophy.

144
00:54:41,792 --> 00:54:43,958
Where is the Kalisk?

145
00:54:48,542 --> 00:54:53,042
I use you, tool. You do not use me!

146
00:54:58,125 --> 00:55:00,625
I use you!

147
00:55:02,583 --> 00:55:05,042
Where is the Kalisk?

148
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:18,583
Then my death will be honorable.

149
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:26,333
Call your sister.

150
00:55:27,292 --> 00:55:29,542
None can stop me.

151
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,042
Save yourself, tool!

152
01:00:52,917 --> 01:00:55,417
Tool, get these off!

153
01:01:03,208 --> 01:01:05,167
You are not Thia.

154
01:01:17,583 --> 01:01:19,417
Release me!

155
01:01:22,375 --> 01:01:25,458
You are another broken tool!

156
01:01:40,542 --> 01:01:42,750
Remove these!

157
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:48,708
Or I'll rip out your spine
and crush your skull!

158
01:01:58,375 --> 01:02:02,667
You are nothing. A device.

159
01:02:03,958 --> 01:02:07,583
Made by others to do their work for them.

160
01:03:21,542 --> 01:03:24,125
You betrayed me!

161
01:07:54,333 --> 01:07:56,042
I trusted you.

162
01:08:02,208 --> 01:08:04,499
Don't like these tools.

163
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:06,999
I'm sorry. My sister is -

164
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,042
Don't like sister either.

165
01:08:16,708 --> 01:08:19,375
Tell tool you're asking about the device.

166
01:08:29,875 --> 01:08:32,333
He's asking about the device.

167
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:35,333
It's a children's toy.

168
01:08:37,125 --> 01:08:39,792
But say it's a map.

169
01:08:48,917 --> 01:08:51,708
Tell tool to look inside.

170
01:09:00,167 --> 01:09:02,041
That was a toy for children?

171
01:09:02,042 --> 01:09:03,250
Yautja children!

172
01:09:09,917 --> 01:09:10,792
Run Dek!

173
01:09:13,083 --> 01:09:14,542
Go... Go!

174
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:29,042
<i>Enter destination coordinates, Kwei.</i>

175
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,292
You saved me, brother.

176
01:12:10,583 --> 01:12:13,542
Wolf.

177
01:13:35,208 --> 01:13:37,000
Kalisk.

178
01:13:43,292 --> 01:13:46,792
Kalisk child.

179
01:20:46,042 --> 01:20:47,708
I came to rescue you.

180
01:20:56,583 --> 01:20:57,958
Wolf.

181
01:21:05,333 --> 01:21:07,083
Bone Bison.

182
01:21:17,458 --> 01:21:19,542
Not yet...

183
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:21,708
Thia.

184
01:21:40,375 --> 01:21:41,708
Kalisk!

185
01:21:47,708 --> 01:21:49,042
Kalisk child!

186
01:21:53,708 --> 01:21:55,708
They have her mother!

187
01:22:12,542 --> 01:22:14,582
You free the Kalisk.

188
01:22:14,583 --> 01:22:16,333
I get my trophy.

189
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,083
You tell me.

190
01:33:02,292 --> 01:33:04,542
That's not yours.

191
01:33:37,958 --> 01:33:40,667
Not yet.

192
01:34:33,625 --> 01:34:35,583
You've come here for revenge?

193
01:34:36,375 --> 01:34:39,208
I've come for my cloak.

194
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:45,083
What is this?

195
01:34:45,583 --> 01:34:48,333
I've completed my hunt.

196
01:34:48,833 --> 01:34:51,208
That is my trophy.

197
01:34:52,708 --> 01:34:54,124
You disgrace our clan...

198
01:34:54,125 --> 01:34:55,667
And so did Kwei.

199
01:34:58,917 --> 01:35:02,417
Get rid of him.

200
01:36:56,333 --> 01:37:00,958
Perhaps the right son did survive.

201
01:37:01,708 --> 01:37:03,957
Yield now...

202
01:37:03,958 --> 01:37:07,333
...and take your place in our clan.

203
01:37:09,042 --> 01:37:12,250
I have my own clan.

204
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,792
No.

205
01:38:36,542 --> 01:38:40,167
It's my mother.

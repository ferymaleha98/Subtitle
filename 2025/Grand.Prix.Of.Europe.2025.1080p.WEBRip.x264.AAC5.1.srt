3
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:02,125
<i>It's the under</i>
<i>mouse story of the century!</i>

4
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:05,208
<i>This riveting young driver</i>
<i>has come out of nowhere</i>

5
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:08,666
<i>and turned the whole</i>
<i>Grand Prix upside down!</i>

6
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,500
<i>And here she is!</i>

7
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:18,125
<i>She's weaving through the race</i>

8
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:21,583
<i>like a kid dodging</i>
<i>broccoli at dinner time.</i>

9
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:23,375
<i>Oh, no!</i>

10
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,833
<i>Out of nowhere, as always,</i>
<i>Edda's nemesis appears,</i>

11
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:28,541
<i>the mysterious Nachtkraab.</i>

12
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:36,166
<i>The suspense is unbearable.</i>

13
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,166
<i>And the shooting star seizes</i>
<i>her moment</i>

14
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,416
<i>and shoots off the ramp!</i>

15
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,375
<i>Edda has driven her way</i>
<i>into the history books</i>

16
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:08,250
<i>with her famous signature move!</i>

17
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:12,083
<i>The rocket ramp spin flip</i>
<i>sky ride.</i>

18
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:15,833
<i>The crowd goes wild celebrating </i>
<i>a new world champion!</i>

19
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:27,791
Edda!

20
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:29,666
What are you doing?

21
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,875
The rocket ramp spin flip
sky ride?

22
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:36,250
You're supposed
to let the customers win.

23
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,250
Oh, come on.

24
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,083
Oops.

25
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:42,833
Sorry, dad.

26
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:44,500
Won't happen again.

27
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:47,791
That was awesome!

28
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:50,833
Please, get your head
outta the clouds, Edda.

29
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:53,208
We're barely holding
the park together.

30
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,208
Sorry.

31
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,416
- Free voucher.
- Yeah!

32
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,666
Here you go.

33
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:58,333
Enjoy that.

34
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:03,750
Oh, Edda, no!
Not the big prizes.

35
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:07,625
Sorry. Good race.

36
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,250
I said sorry.

37
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:14,000
Guess we're closing early?

38
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,625
Dad, I...

39
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,750
Oh, I'll be right back!

40
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:33,250
Oof!

41
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,541
Hey!

42
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,625
Oh. Hey, Edda!

43
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:48,458
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where's the fire?

44
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,833
Today's the Grand Prix
qualifier.

45
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,041
I gotta get to the TV.

46
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,750
Ay yay yay, I nearly forgot.

47
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,958
You better get to Brain Freeze.

48
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:04,833
Hey, Edda!

49
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,000
Whoo!

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,083
Huh?

51
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:53,791
Your future looks lumpy.

52
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:54,791
Hi, Rosa.

53
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:58,791
Edda, I see all in the ball.

54
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,791
Angry hamsters
wanna take you down,

55
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:05,958
one of your legs is
plotting against the other,

56
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:08,333
or you're having waffles later.

57
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:11,083
Oh, I hope it's the waffles,

58
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:13,708
but I'll keep an eye
out for those hamsters!

59
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:17,958
Your fate takes a frosty turn.

60
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,375
Hmm?

61
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:22,791
Or you're gonna have
a milkshake tonight.

62
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:26,666
I hope I didn't miss it.

63
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,375
<i>Heated competition</i>
<i>coming into the home stretch.</i>

64
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,916
<i>It's still anybody's race.</i>

65
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,708
<i>Is this tractor--</i>

66
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,375
Uh, hi. Can I have a chocolate
milkshake but with no chocolate?

67
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:36,875
You mean vanilla?

68
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:40,083
No chocolate.
Just hold the chocolate.

69
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,958
Uh, sure.

70
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,250
<i>Out of nowhere,</i>
<i>and here comes</i>

71
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,375
<i>four time</i>
<i>Grand Prix champion, Ed.</i>

72
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:47,625
<i>He's making his move.</i>

73
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,208
- <i>He's passed Louis.</i>
- Ed!

74
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:50,916
<i>And Olivia and everyone!</i>

75
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,750
<i>He's taken them</i>
<i>on the inside, on the outside!</i>

76
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,000
On all the sides!

77
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,625
Yes, that's right. Come on!

78
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,583
Ooh-hoo! Going into fifth.

79
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,500
He's coming up.
He's past Olivia.

80
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,708
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Watch him go.

81
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,833
Come on, Ed!

82
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:10,375
<i>Ed qualifies</i>
<i>in pole position</i> <i>for the Grand Prix!</i>

83
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,833
There he goes!

84
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,500
I said no vanilla.

85
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,500
Why are you so obsessed
with this Ed guy anyway?

86
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:31,333
I don't know where you got
the idea that I'm obsessed.

87
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,083
I mean,
he's great and everything,

88
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,791
but I'm not obsessed.

89
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:38,375
Edda, sweetheart. I get it.

90
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:41,250
But if my racing days at the
Grand Prix taught me anything

91
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:45,208
is that this race is nothing
but a flashy cash grab.

92
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,625
Real racing is an art,

93
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:50,583
and the Grand Prix
isn't real racing.

94
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,625
I'd make it real if I was in it.

95
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:55,416
You know I've got what it takes.

96
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,750
I could race in the Grand Prix
and I could win if I wasn't stuck here.

97
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,666
Edda, I promise you.

98
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,875
We'll get back to your
pro training someday.

99
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,750
It's just since mom passed...

100
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,083
Sorry, I didn't mean.

101
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,916
I love this park. I do.

102
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,958
And I know how much
it meant to mom.

103
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:29,000
Well, at least
the ghosts are still working.

104
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,625
I miss you, mom.

105
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,583
It's a terribly sad situation.

106
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,833
Really, sir.

107
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:12,250
So many people borrow money
and they just can't afford to pay it back.

108
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,791
Isn't that right, mittens?

109
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,875
Painfully right, Fluffy.

110
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,916
I can pay you back.
Just not right now.

111
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,958
That's the thing though,
isn't it, sir?

112
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,083
The longer you take
to pay us back,

113
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,583
the more money you owe us.

114
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:27,000
It's a vicious circle,
isn't it, Mittens?

115
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:30,166
Ferociously vicious circle,
Fluffy.

116
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,750
One week.

117
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,708
Give me one more week
and I'll have your money.

118
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,083
One week.

119
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,625
You think this dump
is gonna bring in

120
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,458
that kind of money
in seven days?

121
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:41,958
I've been in this business
a long time.

122
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,125
I can do it.

123
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,583
All right then, prove me wrong.

124
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:49,083
But let me remind you
of our agreement, sir.

125
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:52,250
If you don't pay, uh,
what do we do

126
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,958
to his fair ground then,
Mittens?

127
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:56,500
The old rip and scrap, Fluffy.

128
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:57,791
Indeed.

129
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,458
We rip it up
and sell it for scrap.

130
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:14,500
You heard?

131
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,791
Why didn't you tell me?

132
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,541
Edda.

133
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:30,666
I'm just,
I couldn't lose the park.

134
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,291
Your mom,
it's all we have left of her.

135
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:38,208
- I had to...
- You're not gonna lose our home because we are gonna save it.

136
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:41,000
Edda, if there was a way
I'd have found it by now.

137
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,333
No one wants to come
to the fairground anymore.

138
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,583
Yes, they do.
They just don't know it yet.

139
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,583
If you've got an idea,
I'm all ears.

140
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,875
Okay, I don't have one just yet,

141
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:53,333
but when I do it,
it will be brilliant.

142
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,166
I look forward to hearing it.

143
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,875
Oh, this is all my fault.

144
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:32,458
If I hadn't been
so distracted by racing.

145
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:35,958
If I'd, if I'd
focused more on the park.

146
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,625
I won't let us
lose the park, mom.

147
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:44,375
Even, even if it means
letting go of my dream.

148
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,208
Wow.

149
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:08,958
Huh? Edda,
get over here quickly, mira.

150
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,583
The fireworks
have started already.

151
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:14,250
Oh, those Grand Prix folks
sure know

152
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,666
how to throw
a pre-race party, huh?

153
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,041
Well, it must be nice.

154
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:24,666
Edda, you'll get your
chance to race someday.

155
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,083
You don't know that.

156
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:30,708
Oh, yes, I do.
I'm the fortune teller.

157
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:34,458
I know that you will race
in the Grand Prix.

158
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:36,333
Just like I know that...

159
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:44,000
aquatic elves have been
stealing your junk mail.

160
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,041
That's it!

161
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:50,375
What's it? Aquatic elves?

162
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,875
What are they?
Fish or little guys?

163
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:54,875
Junk mail!

164
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,166
There are folks
from all across Europe at that party, right?

165
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:02,250
If I hand out park flyers
and get enough people to show up,

166
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,791
maybe my dad
can pay off his loan.

167
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:08,875
Don't worry, guys.
I'm gonna fix this.

168
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:17,375
Welcome to the Grand Prix
of Europe.

169
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,833
What a day. What a city.

170
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,208
What a tower. What a party.

171
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:28,750
What a race!

172
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,083
You can feel the air
sizzling with excitement.

173
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,625
Aye, Peri?

174
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,375
Well said, old boy.

175
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:39,583
And now, introducing
former Grand Prix winner

176
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:44,000
and Grand Prix League president,
Cindy!

177
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:48,458
Thank you Enzo,
and thank you, Paris.

178
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,833
Today we celebrate
the best drivers

179
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:54,875
all across the world
ahead of tomorrow's race.

180
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,583
The best race in the world.

181
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:59,666
The Grand Prix.

182
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:08,458
Why watch racing
when you can come to our park and race for real?

183
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:14,375
Our track makes the Grand Prix
look like a driving lesson with grandma.

184
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:20,708
So, are you ready to welcome
your Grand Prix stars?

185
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,666
They're gonna blow our minds
in France, Germany

186
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:31,083
and Switzerland,
Italy and England.

187
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,916
How about we meet the drivers?

188
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,041
First up the goat
who knows no fear.

189
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:42,375
It's Bockli!

190
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,916
Hello, Paris!

191
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,666
Cindy, I have a gift for you.

192
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,333
How wonderful!

193
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:58,416
A luxury box
of exquisite Swiss...

194
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,541
Cheese for everyone.

195
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:01,625
Cheese.

196
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,958
Give it up for Bockli!

197
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:09,791
Next up is the bear
who always comes in second,

198
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:15,750
but is always a great
sport about it, Magnus!

199
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,875
Naturally, Magnus
is starting position

200
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:23,625
in tomorrow's race
will be number two.

201
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,791
Yes, yes. Thank you!

202
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:28,458
I'm just happy to be here
and be part of the...

203
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:32,125
And finally, he is the
four time Grand Prix champion

204
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,333
and on his way
to becoming a living legend

205
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:39,041
if he makes it
to number five, it's Ed!

206
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,083
Yay.

207
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,833
Our youngest driver.

208
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,541
And fastest.

209
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,541
I love you, Ed!

210
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:07,250
I love you, Ed.

211
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:08,708
I love you too!

212
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,375
Ed, anything you want
to say to your fans?

213
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,083
Sure.

214
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:17,583
I'd like to compliment them
on their excellent taste.

215
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:22,083
I just died.

216
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:25,458
Ladies and gentlemen, Ed.

217
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:29,041
Have you ever seen
anyone else as cool?

218
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,791
I haven't.

219
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:35,291
And I hang out with racing
drivers in a literal zeppelin.

220
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,458
Oh, no!

221
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:37,875
No, no, no. Come back!

222
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,583
Let's have a look
at the other drivers.

223
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,291
Come back!

224
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:48,125
Oh, its Ed's car.

225
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:02,833
Well, there's no harm
in looking or touching.

226
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,166
Wow.

227
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:13,458
As long as I don't...

228
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,958
Ed! Ed!

229
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,541
Can I get a selfie, please?

230
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:23,875
Will you sign my face?

231
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,625
Hi. Hi there. Hi.

232
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:28,125
It's real pleasure.
Thank you so much.

233
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,041
- Hey.
- You are too kind.

234
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,833
This is-- My car?

235
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,833
- Huh?
- Excuse me. Sorry.

236
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,166
Ed! Ed, please!

237
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,208
Look somebody
more famous than me.

238
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,625
More famous?

239
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,583
Can I smell them?

240
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,916
No, no, no! Hey!

241
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,750
This is unbelievable!

242
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,666
Wait!

243
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,208
Stop that car!

244
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:52,458
Whoa, ah!

245
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,583
Whoo-hoo!

246
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,458
Who the high octane tank
are you?

247
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,166
Oh, my gosh.
You're my greatest fan!

248
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,375
I mean, I'm your biggest hero!
I mean, uh!

249
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,000
Get out of my car.

250
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,666
You're so different on TV.

251
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,541
Your real life voice
is so angry.

252
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:16,000
Stop this car and get out!

253
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,791
Okay. Okay.

254
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:21,083
Uh, where's the off switch?

255
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,958
Push that!

256
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,083
Uh, eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

257
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:26,416
I pick you!

258
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:35,750
I can't believe
I'm driving with the Ed!

259
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:42,208
I can't believe this either.

260
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,750
Drive back to the garage.

261
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,458
Okay!

262
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,416
How did you do that?

263
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,083
Oh, that's nothing compared
to that time in Madrid

264
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,916
when you were behind Nachtkraab
and you took that ramp.

265
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,125
Okay, I get it.
You know my work.

266
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,083
Can I show you
just one more thing?

267
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:13,083
No! back to the garage now.

268
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,166
Whoo!

269
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:58,958
I just saved Ed's life
with my driving skills.

270
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,125
I'm a hero.

271
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,041
Oh, you're a monster!

272
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:10,750
Cheese balls.

273
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:14,583
Do you see what you've done?
I can't drive like this!

274
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:18,916
Thanks to my biggest
fan, ah, I can't drive!

275
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,416
Then let's go to a hospital
and get you fixed up.

276
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,500
I'll drive.

277
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,000
No. No hospitals.

278
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,291
An injury is a disqualification.

279
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,041
Please, no one can know.

280
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,250
Okay, but you need help.

281
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,541
Oh, I have an idea.

282
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,541
Here we are. Home sweet home.

283
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,916
Wait, you live here?

284
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,125
Uh-huh.

285
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,291
On purpose?

286
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:52,875
Any fried food sludge gets
on these shoes, I'm sending you the bill.

287
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:57,583
Huh? This is the worst
breakage I've ever seen.

288
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,416
Your arms like a noodle.

289
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,250
I'm over here.

290
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,416
Ah, there's your arm.

291
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:08,916
You shouldn't tip your
limbs in such dark places.

292
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,708
Oh, congratulations.
It's not broken.

293
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:19,958
But un-congratulations.
It's badly sprained.

294
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,000
Quite painful, probably.

295
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,583
Oh, you think?

296
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:27,125
No driving for a few weeks.

297
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,416
Weeks?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

298
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,666
I have to drive.
I have to drive tomorrow.

299
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,208
Are you even a doctor?

300
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,625
Better than that?
I'm a fortune teller.

301
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:42,583
I foresee frustration
and annoyance in your future.

302
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,250
No, this isn't fair!

303
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:55,458
My prophecy is confirmed.

304
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,375
Hey, Edda.

305
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,041
It's tough
to save the park, aye?

306
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,583
Oh! Ow!

307
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,291
You're not Edda!

308
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:11,750
How dare you not recognize
the world's greatest racer!

309
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:15,375
Huh, we do kinda look alike.

310
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:20,083
Not our faces,
but same size, same build.

311
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,375
Same little piece of hair
that sticks up.

312
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,000
Ah, ow!

313
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:27,000
You, you, you weirdos!

314
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,791
You've ruined my life.

315
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:32,166
Okay, this guy
is coco like a loco. All right, Edda.

316
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,833
Why are we helping him again?

317
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:37,208
He's a tortured genius.
He can't be great and sweet.

318
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,250
Well, you are.

319
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:43,333
Actually, I'm great, sweet
and a genius.

320
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:46,333
I'll drive
in Ed's place tomorrow.

321
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,250
Do you really think that you...

322
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:56,416
Wait, if we look alike,
but you can't drive and I can.

323
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,708
No, no, no. No way.

324
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:01,750
I'm just saying
I could take your place.

325
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:05,083
Who would know?
I'd be wearing your helmet.

326
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,875
I am more than a helmet.

327
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:10,375
I am the world's
greatest racing driver.

328
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:12,041
No one would fall for it.

329
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,416
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You are right.

330
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,375
It was a stupid idea.
You should just drop out.

331
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:20,291
Give up
on that fifth championship.

332
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:23,541
I mean, who cares
if you become a living legend?

333
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:26,916
I care.

334
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:28,750
All right.

335
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:31,250
But I guide you through
with an earpiece.

336
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:32,958
You do exactly what I tell you.

337
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:34,916
Of course, of course.
Whatever you want.

338
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,500
Also, you give me
half your prize money.

339
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:38,583
Huh? What?

340
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:41,083
I'm saving your career.

341
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:43,500
You endangered my career.

342
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:46,333
I need that money. We need it.

343
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:49,875
If I don't save the park,
there's no deal.

344
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:52,458
Okay. Okay, fine.

345
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:56,416
As long as I never have to come
near any of you ever again.

346
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:01,625
I can't believe I'm gonna
drive in the Grand Prix.

347
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:04,791
No, neither can I.

348
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:06,875
Yeah!

349
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:11,500
Worst idea in history.

350
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:15,916
I'm gonna save the park, Mom.

351
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:18,833
My way.

352
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:37,041
Ooh, my muffins.

353
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,791
And now my sabotage.

354
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:45,958
When an undetectable
quick drying grease slick

355
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:49,833
hits the course that stuck up
Ed won't know what hit him.

356
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:03,500
Race fans,
only a few hours to go

357
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:06,083
until the start of their
biggest race of the year

358
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:10,000
with the 40 best drivers
on the planet!

359
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:12,500
But they don't just
have to beat each other.

360
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:15,250
They also have to survive
a gauntlet of traps,

361
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:17,958
each more fiendish
than the last.

362
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:23,166
Welcome to the Grand Prix
of Europe!

363
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:26,208
Let's see if we can grab
some of our drivers.

364
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:28,000
Magnus. Hey, Magnus!

365
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:31,333
Hello there, Cindy.
Lovely to see you as always.

366
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:34,458
So, Magnus, you haven't made it
to the top of the podium yet.

367
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,541
You know, for me, it's about
being part of the action,

368
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:40,500
not about winning, because...

369
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:45,416
is absolutely
not about the winning.

370
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,583
We're gonna try anything
different, Magnus?

371
00:24:47,666 --> 00:24:49,625
And he tricks up
those furry sleeves?

372
00:24:49,708 --> 00:24:51,375
Oh, oui, oui, oui, oui, oui.

373
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:57,250
Do tell us. How do you plan
to underwhelm us all today?

374
00:24:57,333 --> 00:25:00,458
Ed, any thoughts
from our front runner?

375
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:01,500
Hi.

376
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,250
Oh, and who's this all cozied up

377
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:05,958
to the Grand Prix
diehard lone mouse.

378
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:07,333
Uh.

379
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:09,166
Uh, yeah.

380
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:12,458
This is my biggest super fan.

381
00:25:12,541 --> 00:25:15,666
They won a contest for
the VIP meet and greet

382
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:20,291
lasting the entire
duration of the Grand Prix.

383
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:23,208
And you know
I'm all about my fans.

384
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:26,291
How did I not know
about this contest?

385
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:30,416
Oh, okay. Any thoughts
from Ed's luckiest fan?

386
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,250
- I...
- Nope.

387
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:40,625
Wow the zeppelin
is bigger than I thought.

388
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Oh, there's Olivia.

389
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:47,291
Are she and Louie
really sworn enemies or is it all just an act?

390
00:25:47,375 --> 00:25:50,166
I have no idea.

391
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,666
Bockli!

392
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,166
Oh, play it cool. Play it cool.

393
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,083
Is he as nice in real life?

394
00:25:56,166 --> 00:25:57,250
I dunno.

395
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:02,291
Nachtkraab, the night raven.

396
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:04,500
Is it true he's a servant
of darkness

397
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:07,875
and sworn to destroy
all who's stand in his way?

398
00:26:07,958 --> 00:26:09,541
How would I know?

399
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:12,416
Well, you've been racing
with these people for years.

400
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,291
Don't you know
anything about them?

401
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:17,916
No. And I plan on keeping it
that way.

402
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,875
I've been watching you, Edward.

403
00:26:19,958 --> 00:26:23,708
You've lost your edge.
You've become too confident.

404
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:25,500
Cocky people make mistakes,

405
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:30,500
and people who make
mistakes have accidents.

406
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:33,250
That was totally a threat.

407
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:36,166
I still really want
his autograph though.

408
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,500
<i>Eighteen hours</i>
<i>until the first race in Paris.</i>

409
00:26:40,583 --> 00:26:43,333
So where's next on the tour?

410
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:57,875
Hmm, graceful.

411
00:26:57,958 --> 00:27:01,000
Just because you're dressed
like me,

412
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:06,666
doesn't mean you can be me.

413
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,958
I bet I can.

414
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:11,541
You're on.

432

So, you really are obsessed
with me.

433
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:50,583
I think I've got everything.

434
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:53,375
Even down
to how you scratch your butt.

435
00:27:53,458 --> 00:27:56,958
Were you born this annoying
or did you take classes?

436
00:27:57,041 --> 00:28:00,000
Wait, was that a genuine smile?

437
00:28:00,083 --> 00:28:02,458
Oh, is your face okay?

438
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:05,125
Right, yeah.

439
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:07,791
Anyway, I will direct
your every move

440
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:10,083
via this earpiece.

441
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:13,625
What for?
I know how to drive like you.

442
00:28:13,708 --> 00:28:15,833
Hang back, but not too far.

443
00:28:15,916 --> 00:28:18,833
Wait for inspiration,
then seize your moment

444
00:28:18,916 --> 00:28:20,125
and zoom to the front.

445
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:23,083
Wrong! Inspiration?

446
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:25,875
You think I wait to feel
something so I can make a move?

447
00:28:25,958 --> 00:28:28,583
No, I feel nothing.

448
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:29,583
Ow!

449
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,125
Well, you felt that.

450
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:34,541
And nothing I do in a race
is based on emotion.

451
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:36,791
Everything I do
is meticulously pre-planned

452
00:28:36,875 --> 00:28:39,083
based on an in-depth
analysis of my opponents,

453
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:41,833
their vehicles, the course,
the weather conditions.

454
00:28:41,916 --> 00:28:44,625
So complicated. Sheesh.

455
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:46,458
Why don't you just drive?

456
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:50,625
Because I am not a driver.
I am a winner.

457
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:52,333
<i>Drivers, get ready!</i>

458
00:28:52,416 --> 00:28:54,541
It's time.

459
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:05,166
Oh, yes. This way.

460
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:08,625
The Grand Prix of Europe,
Race One.

461
00:29:08,708 --> 00:29:10,708
Are you as excited
as I am, Peri?

462
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,583
Whoa. Settle down there,
old boy.

463
00:29:13,666 --> 00:29:14,708
Give my ears a rest.

464
00:29:14,791 --> 00:29:16,458
The racing
hasn't even started yet.

465
00:29:16,541 --> 00:29:18,500
Now, let's break it down.

466
00:29:18,583 --> 00:29:19,791
There'll be four races,

467
00:29:19,875 --> 00:29:21,416
each one in a different country.

468
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,291
Forty drivers start today.

469
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:25,458
But in each race,
they last 10 drivers

470
00:29:25,541 --> 00:29:28,083
to the finish line
will be eliminated,

471
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,333
which means
only 10 drivers will be left

472
00:29:30,416 --> 00:29:33,833
to compete in the final race
in London next week.

473
00:29:33,916 --> 00:29:36,291
But these aren't
your grandma's races.

474
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:37,583
Isn't that right, Cindy?

475
00:29:37,666 --> 00:29:39,041
That's right, Enzo.

476
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:41,125
These action packed contests

477
00:29:41,208 --> 00:29:45,291
come with pulse pounding,
over the top traps, tricks,

478
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:47,750
and treachery on the tracks.

479
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:49,375
Yes, indeedy.

480
00:29:49,458 --> 00:29:53,000
And Cindy is the diabolical
wizard behind it all.

481
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:58,625
And you won't believe
the obstacles I've crafted for today's race.

482
00:29:58,708 --> 00:30:03,125
So, let the pandemonium begin.

483
00:30:12,916 --> 00:30:15,041
I can do this.

484
00:30:15,125 --> 00:30:16,416
No, I can't.

485
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,750
No, no, no. I can't.

486
00:30:19,166 --> 00:30:20,458
Why are you breathing
like that?

487
00:30:20,541 --> 00:30:22,333
You better be okay.

488
00:30:22,416 --> 00:30:23,375
I'm great.

489
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:24,625
I'm, I'm perfect.

490
00:30:24,708 --> 00:30:26,833
Your voice is shaking.

491
00:30:26,916 --> 00:30:29,166
Shaking with excitement.

492
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:32,500
Remember, all you've
got to do to move on

493
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:35,458
to the next race is
finish in the top 30 cars.

494
00:30:35,541 --> 00:30:37,666
We just need to stay outta
the last 10.

495
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:41,166
Oh, boy,
this is really happening.

496
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:46,958
<i>And last but never</i>
<i>least in pole position, Ed!</i>

497
00:30:51,291 --> 00:30:54,625
That's you. Oh, I mean me.

498
00:30:54,708 --> 00:30:55,791
That's us.

499
00:30:56,625 --> 00:30:57,666
Oh, mousetrap.

500
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,916
Drivers, are you ready

501
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,916
for the 50th Grand Prix
of Europe?

502
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,041
Then let's get
this party started!

503
00:31:09,958 --> 00:31:13,416
So, the 40 drivers are lined up on the starting grid.

504
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,875
It's animal and machine
in perfect harmony.

505
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:18,875
Uh.

506
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:21,541
Um.

507
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:23,291
The red one.

508
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:28,666
A thousand
kilometers of high octane,

509
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,541
hyped up havoc on the highway.

510
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:35,625
These are the craziest
races Europe has ever seen.

511
00:31:38,458 --> 00:31:40,166
Go!

512
00:31:45,208 --> 00:31:46,541
Wa-hoo-hoo!

513
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:48,708
I must be dreaming.

514
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:52,041
I'm driving in the Grand Prix!

515
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,541
Hello, Ed.

516
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:59,291
You seem a bit nervous.
Be careful.

517
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,750
One mistake
can cost you a victory.

518
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:05,500
Winning is not the most
important thing. Right, Ed?

519
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:08,375
Well, in this case, it is.

520
00:32:08,458 --> 00:32:12,000
What's up, folks?
Can you tell me one thing?

521
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:14,750
How do I look from behind?

522
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:16,458
Very nice, Olivia.

523
00:32:16,541 --> 00:32:19,583
Ed's being passed
by Olivia, Magnus, Bockli,

524
00:32:19,666 --> 00:32:22,125
and now every one else.

525
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:25,458
What a move
on the inside by Louie!

526
00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:27,291
Great use of barriers.

527
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:34,083
And here's Richard.
That ain't Pond. Richard Pond.

528
00:32:35,541 --> 00:32:38,875
Close behind the surprisingly
ever helpful Bockli

529
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:41,416
Your tires are smoking, Richard.

530
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,250
Probably because
I'm going so fast.

531
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:46,875
You sure
your hand brake isn't on?

532
00:32:46,958 --> 00:32:50,625
I knew that.
Part of my strategy.

533
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:56,000
Back of the front,
Louie is being hounded by Wolf.

534
00:32:56,083 --> 00:32:58,791
It's high speed and low cunning.

535
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:03,083
Ah.

536
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:16,541
A wolf in sheep's clothing.

537
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:19,333
Watch your line.
They're passing you.

538
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:24,250
It looks like Ed
might be suffering some sort of mechanical issue.

539
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:27,458
It's a masterclass in losing.

540
00:33:27,541 --> 00:33:30,041
No more cars
are getting past me.

541
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:32,708
True. Seeing as you're
now in last place.

542
00:33:32,791 --> 00:33:34,125
Oh.

543
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,458
How's it looking
up there, Cindy?

544
00:33:36,541 --> 00:33:41,875
It's looking way
too easy, Enzo.

545
00:33:43,833 --> 00:33:45,750
The atmosphere's electric.

546
00:33:45,833 --> 00:33:47,916
Feel the crackle
of anticipation.

547
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,708
Wait, that's not anticipation.

548
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:52,875
It's lightning!
Actual lightning!

549
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:56,375
Did it get dark all of a sudden?

550
00:33:58,708 --> 00:34:00,750
Ooh, shocking.

551
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:06,041
Forget the lightning.
Just focus on the road ahead.

552
00:34:09,458 --> 00:34:11,625
There's an opening ahead.
Now's your chance.

553
00:34:11,708 --> 00:34:15,375
To do what, get fried?
I can't see anything.

554
00:34:15,458 --> 00:34:17,125
I'll guide you.

555
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:20,125
Get into the middle of the road,
you'll glide right through them.

556
00:34:21,541 --> 00:34:23,875
Whoa.
Would you look at this?

557
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:27,125
Ed's powering on
fast as grease lighting,

558
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:30,041
like a bolt out the blue.

559
00:34:30,125 --> 00:34:31,291
It worked!

560
00:34:31,375 --> 00:34:32,791
You sound surprised.

561
00:34:36,458 --> 00:34:37,916
And here comes Ed.

562
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,083
Can he pull it back after
that terrible start?

563
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:43,750
He's bearing down on Magnus.

564
00:34:47,625 --> 00:34:48,958
Now all you have to do is,

565
00:34:53,708 --> 00:34:55,125
Donuts?

566
00:34:55,208 --> 00:34:56,666
Why are you doing donuts?

567
00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:00,166
I don't know what's happening.

568
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:03,583
I do.
A sloppy driver is happening.

569
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:05,625
You're losing.

570
00:35:05,708 --> 00:35:07,416
Which means I'm losing.

571
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,875
And I don't lose.

572
00:35:19,916 --> 00:35:22,583
Is Magnus
about to take the lead?

573
00:35:22,666 --> 00:35:26,833
Is this the moment
he finally wins, oh, of course he isn't!

574
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,833
Victory goes to Nachtkraab!

575
00:35:36,791 --> 00:35:37,958
Oh!

576
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,500
And superstar Ed
will be all the way back.

577
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:46,958
Yeah!

578
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:49,083
In last position.

579
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:54,666
Let's have
a look at the highlights.

580
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:56,750
I see victory.

581
00:35:56,833 --> 00:35:59,875
Oh, geez,.
I can't be sure.

582
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:04,500
Sorry, got distracted by Ed's
terrible uninspired driving.

583
00:36:04,583 --> 00:36:09,500
So is this the secret TV
watching stand or the ice cream stand?

584
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:11,583
Um, both?

585
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:14,875
Turn it off.
Where is Edda, anyway?

586
00:36:14,958 --> 00:36:19,375
There is no Edda at the moment.

587
00:36:19,458 --> 00:36:23,000
Okay, very helpful. Thanks.

588
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:27,541
Ah, brain freeze!

589
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:30,625
As advertised.

590
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:35,625
This is all because you did
that stupid stunt and lost control.

591
00:36:35,708 --> 00:36:38,625
There was something on the
course that made me spin out.

592
00:36:38,708 --> 00:36:40,750
Yeah. A bad driver.

593
00:36:40,833 --> 00:36:43,333
It, it wasn't on purpose.
It, it was...

594
00:36:43,416 --> 00:36:46,083
Oh, spinning round
and round for no reason.

595
00:36:46,166 --> 00:36:48,250
That doesn't make it okay.

596
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:52,125
Oh, oh, no. You were right.

597
00:36:52,208 --> 00:36:54,166
I can't do this.

598
00:36:56,291 --> 00:36:58,791
What is this? What's happening?

599
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:01,666
I'm not up to it.

600
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:04,250
I'm not good enough.

601
00:37:04,333 --> 00:37:05,750
Hey.

602
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:08,416
That's not true.
Well, not completely true.

603
00:37:09,916 --> 00:37:12,916
Well, no, no, no, no.
I didn't mean it.

604
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,666
You, you can do this.

605
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:19,375
I honestly, desperately
need you to believe that.

606
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:22,833
Maybe I am just
a fairground nobody.

607
00:37:22,916 --> 00:37:25,625
Maybe my dream
should have stayed a dream.

608
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:34,833
There, there?

609
00:37:34,916 --> 00:37:36,458
Uh.

610
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:39,666
Look, take some time.

611
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,250
Take as much time as you need.

612
00:37:41,333 --> 00:37:44,500
I'll give you some space
while I go

613
00:37:44,583 --> 00:37:46,833
and make excuses
for your terrible driving.

614
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:09,000
Oh, wow.

615
00:38:12,041 --> 00:38:17,791
Roger, my magnificent
machine is crinkled.

616
00:38:17,875 --> 00:38:19,833
Crinkled!

617
00:38:19,916 --> 00:38:23,583
Are you sure it's not your
giant ego that's crinkled?

618
00:38:23,666 --> 00:38:27,500
Guys, my car's leaking
a strange liquid.

619
00:38:27,583 --> 00:38:30,041
That's
windscreen cleaner, honey.

620
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,541
<i>A cleaning</i>
<i>team to Richard, please.</i>

621
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:35,333
Hey, you. Super fan!

622
00:38:35,416 --> 00:38:39,166
You star drove like day
old derriere out there!

623
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,833
<i>Pourquoi?</i>

624
00:38:40,916 --> 00:38:44,375
I don't know maybe I,
uh,.

625
00:38:44,458 --> 00:38:49,208
I, he just wasn't as good
as he thought he was.

626
00:38:49,291 --> 00:38:51,916
No one's as good as
that chap thinks he is.

627
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,541
Well, I'm, I'm sure it was
just a mechanical problem.

628
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,458
The next race will go better.

629
00:38:58,541 --> 00:39:01,625
I promise. He promises.

630
00:39:01,708 --> 00:39:04,083
Your hero should be careful.

631
00:39:04,166 --> 00:39:05,833
Very careful.

632
00:39:05,916 --> 00:39:07,166
- Yes.
- You got that right.

633
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,333
He should.

634
00:39:08,791 --> 00:39:12,541
So, you're the fan
who can't get enough of Ed?

635
00:39:12,625 --> 00:39:16,416
Yeah, yeah. He's great.

636
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,416
You haven't spent much
time with him yet, have you?

637
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,791
There you are.

638
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:22,833
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

639
00:39:22,916 --> 00:39:24,666
I was just talking to...

640
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,208
And now you are finished.

641
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:29,625
Ed, if you ever need
to talk about anything.

642
00:39:29,708 --> 00:39:31,041
Oh, I won't.

643
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,833
What were you doing
talking to the other drivers?

644
00:39:40,916 --> 00:39:43,041
You'll blow our cover.
Stay away from them.

645
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:45,416
Why are you so mean to everyone?

646
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,500
The others hang out
and help each other.

647
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:49,333
Yeah, where's that got them?

648
00:39:49,416 --> 00:39:50,916
Behind me.

649
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,083
Great drivers don't need help.

650
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:57,625
- Want me to get that?
- No.

651
00:40:01,625 --> 00:40:04,333
See, I'm absolutely fine.

652
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,041
But don't you ever get lonely?

653
00:40:07,125 --> 00:40:08,500
I have thousands of fans.

654
00:40:08,583 --> 00:40:10,916
How could I possibly be lonely?

655
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,125
You better be ready for this.

656
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:34,000
I've studied the route,
the other drivers,

657
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:35,875
their bad habits,
Cindy's favorite obstacles

658
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:38,375
and Bockli's top three
flavors of ice cream.

659
00:40:38,458 --> 00:40:39,791
Bockli?

660
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:41,750
I'm on the lookout
for a new role model.

661
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:44,250
Yeah, but Berkeley?

662
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,583
Welcome to the German
and Swiss Bliss

663
00:40:48,666 --> 00:40:50,125
you don't wanna miss.

664
00:40:50,208 --> 00:40:51,916
All through the Alps, forests,

665
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,208
mountains, alpine villages
and snow, snow,

666
00:40:55,291 --> 00:40:58,333
and you guessed it,
even more snow.

667
00:40:58,416 --> 00:41:00,250
It's so beautiful.

668
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:02,750
But things could get ugly
if our racers

669
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:05,791
can't handle today's obstacles.

670
00:41:05,875 --> 00:41:08,708
Today I wanna be in the top 10.

671
00:41:08,791 --> 00:41:11,166
<i>Losing doesn't feel good,</i>
<i>does it?</i>

672
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:12,833
Maybe you'll listen to me today.

673
00:41:13,958 --> 00:41:15,333
I guess I should.

674
00:41:15,416 --> 00:41:17,958
I mean, you're on my pajamas
for a reason.

675
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:20,041
I'm on your what?

676
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:21,375
Ten have fallen.

677
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:22,666
Thirty remain.

678
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:25,541
Who am I going
to knock out today?

679
00:41:25,625 --> 00:41:27,625
As we wait for the signal, Peri,

680
00:41:27,708 --> 00:41:30,375
do you think Ed will
be back in form today?

681
00:41:30,458 --> 00:41:34,333
Or will his slump spell doom
for his hopes of a fifth win?

682
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,833
Absolutely.

683
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:43,125
Another controversial opinion
from Peri.

684
00:41:43,208 --> 00:41:45,666
That's why he makes
the big bucks.

685
00:41:46,458 --> 00:41:48,875
<i>Now, just stay behind</i>
<i>the cars in front of you.</i>

686
00:41:48,958 --> 00:41:51,458
We'll make a move later.
For now, just drive.

687
00:41:51,541 --> 00:41:53,791
Drivers, get ready.

688
00:41:53,875 --> 00:41:56,375
It's race time!

689
00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:02,666
And the drivers are off!

690
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:05,750
First, we race through
the beautiful forest.

691
00:42:13,083 --> 00:42:14,291
Oh, we lost one already.

692
00:42:15,458 --> 00:42:17,500
Oh, whoa.

693
00:42:17,583 --> 00:42:19,333
You know what they say, folks,

694
00:42:19,416 --> 00:42:20,958
when you're lost in the forest,

695
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:22,916
make sure you stick to the path.

696
00:42:28,666 --> 00:42:32,333
Now we go through the mountain
tunnels into the Swiss Alps.

697
00:42:33,375 --> 00:42:36,291
So Cindy, what's in store
for our drivers today?

698
00:42:36,375 --> 00:42:39,208
They're about
to find out, Enzo. Haha.

699
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:43,083
Oh, pretty.

700
00:42:48,208 --> 00:42:50,666
Ah, pretty dangerous!

701
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:53,291
Oh, Cindy, that is not cool!

702
00:42:53,375 --> 00:42:54,666
That's cold.

703
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:57,000
Oh, I don't like this.

704
00:42:57,083 --> 00:42:58,583
You're not supposed to like it.

705
00:42:58,666 --> 00:43:00,583
You are supposed to avoid it.

706
00:43:00,666 --> 00:43:02,541
Oh, great advice!

707
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,708
Richard, what are doing?

708
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:07,916
Ha ha. It's okay.

709
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,791
It's all a trick.

710
00:43:09,875 --> 00:43:14,916
They're not real snow balls!

711
00:43:15,375 --> 00:43:17,500
Chill out and enjoys
the ride, my friend.

712
00:43:23,541 --> 00:43:25,708
Don't mind if cocka-doodle-doo!

713
00:43:26,166 --> 00:43:28,625
It looks like
our favorite rooster

714
00:43:28,708 --> 00:43:30,791
has activated his booster!

715
00:43:33,041 --> 00:43:34,250
Oh, wait a second.

716
00:43:34,333 --> 00:43:35,666
What is this?

717
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,541
It stopped!
What's happening now?

718
00:43:37,625 --> 00:43:41,000
Out of the way road hog,
beep beep.

719
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,791
You got a new
trick up your sleeve, Cindy?

720
00:43:48,875 --> 00:43:52,291
It's not me,
Enzo, but I like it.

721
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:54,750
Did you see that?

722
00:43:54,833 --> 00:43:57,208
I think someone's
interfering with the race.

723
00:43:58,333 --> 00:44:00,375
Maybe that's why I spun out
in Paris.

724
00:44:00,458 --> 00:44:02,458
You're imagining things.

725
00:44:02,541 --> 00:44:05,166
It seems like I've got a
very powerful imagination!

726
00:44:07,416 --> 00:44:09,666
I gotta shake these things.

727
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:11,250
Ignore it. Just drive.

728
00:44:11,333 --> 00:44:14,541
That's easy for you to say.
It's gaining on me!

729
00:44:16,291 --> 00:44:18,458
That's it. I can fix this.

730
00:44:18,541 --> 00:44:20,375
No, no. No stunts!

731
00:44:31,166 --> 00:44:35,666
I call that move the
rocket spin flip sky ride!

732
00:44:40,416 --> 00:44:43,958
Find a line on
the left. You'll make it!

733
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:46,333
And the ice cold stunt driving

734
00:44:46,416 --> 00:44:49,375
has put Ed back
amongst the contenders.

735
00:44:49,458 --> 00:44:51,333
Ha, dunno what's got
into this Ed clown

736
00:44:51,416 --> 00:44:54,250
but he's driving better
than he has in years.

737
00:44:54,333 --> 00:44:59,291
But there is no Ed
at the moment.

738
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:05,291
This is bananas.
I can't breathe.

739
00:45:05,375 --> 00:45:07,541
Magnus and Nachtkraab
are neck and neck.

740
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,458
Could the bear
finally break his streak

741
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:11,875
and actually win a race?

742
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,541
Yes. Yes.

743
00:45:14,625 --> 00:45:15,708
Yes!

744
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:21,291
Unbelievable!

745
00:45:21,375 --> 00:45:22,958
No!

746
00:45:26,833 --> 00:45:29,375
This is why
I love the Grand Prix.

747
00:45:30,791 --> 00:45:33,000
Nobody could have seen that
coming.

748
00:45:33,083 --> 00:45:34,666
Peri is losing it!

749
00:45:37,916 --> 00:45:39,416
Yes. We made it!

750
00:45:40,541 --> 00:45:41,625
Woo-hoo!

751
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:55,166
Oh, so nice to be back home.

752
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:58,041
With my favorite, cheese fondue.

753
00:45:58,125 --> 00:45:59,208
Hmm.

754
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:02,708
I love fondue.

755
00:46:02,791 --> 00:46:06,416
I just wish
it wasn't so painful to eat.

756
00:46:08,458 --> 00:46:10,666
Did you see how amazing
I was out there today

757
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:12,333
with those snow boulders?

758
00:46:12,416 --> 00:46:15,916
Sweetie, they're
called hashtag sno-lders.

759
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,708
Get with the time.

760
00:46:17,791 --> 00:46:19,125
Whatever they're called,

761
00:46:19,208 --> 00:46:21,583
they seem to have a mind
of their own.

762
00:46:21,666 --> 00:46:23,041
What's that called?

763
00:46:23,125 --> 00:46:26,666
When inanimate objects
suddenly come alive?

764
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:29,125
Starts with an S.

765
00:46:29,208 --> 00:46:30,750
Sabotage.

766
00:46:30,833 --> 00:46:34,500
Uh, I think he meant sentient,

767
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:37,625
Ed head, not sabotage.

768
00:46:37,708 --> 00:46:39,958
You think there was foul play?

769
00:46:40,041 --> 00:46:41,791
But who would do that?

770
00:46:41,875 --> 00:46:43,416
I'll tell you who.

771
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,958
Please do.

772
00:46:47,041 --> 00:46:49,125
Hmm?

773
00:46:49,208 --> 00:46:52,791
I, uh, I don't want
to disturb your meal.

774
00:46:52,875 --> 00:46:57,083
Are you sure
you don't want to join us?

775
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:03,458
Nachtkraab's sabotaging
the race. I know it.

776
00:47:03,541 --> 00:47:06,666
Edda, take a breath. Sit down.

777
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:11,625
He's evil and he's got a
very threatening cheese fork.

778
00:47:11,708 --> 00:47:14,583
Relax. It's just the
pressure of the Grand Prix.

779
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:18,708
It's completely normal to
be paranoid and delusional.

780
00:47:18,791 --> 00:47:19,916
Is it?

781
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,333
No. I'm trying
to make you feel better.

782
00:47:22,416 --> 00:47:24,750
You told me to be nice, right?

783
00:47:25,458 --> 00:47:27,541
Yeah. Okay.

784
00:47:27,625 --> 00:47:29,541
I mean, I guess it's a start.

785
00:47:29,625 --> 00:47:32,916
Not a good start,
but you're trying.

786
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,375
I'm not paranoid though.

787
00:47:34,458 --> 00:47:37,083
Hmm. Nachtkraab
is up to something.

788
00:47:37,166 --> 00:47:38,375
I know it.

789
00:47:43,666 --> 00:47:44,833
Oh, oh.

790
00:47:46,375 --> 00:47:51,250
I said Rocky Road Ice cream,
not sockey road.

791
00:47:51,333 --> 00:47:53,208
I'm terribly sorry.

792
00:47:53,291 --> 00:47:56,458
Jorge! What did I say
about taking off your socks at work?

793
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:58,583
Nobody wants to see your hooves.

794
00:47:58,666 --> 00:48:02,500
Rosa? Why are you doing this?
Where's Jorge?

795
00:48:02,583 --> 00:48:04,166
Wow. Look at that
beautiful move.

796
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:06,916
Did you see that? Ha.

797
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,583
Why do you even bother
hiding the TV at this point?

798
00:48:10,666 --> 00:48:12,583
Honestly, you're as bad as Edda.

799
00:48:12,666 --> 00:48:14,208
Say, where is Edda?

800
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:15,583
Laundromat.

801
00:48:15,666 --> 00:48:17,250
- Gym?
- Yeah.

802
00:48:17,333 --> 00:48:20,416
She's, she's doing that, uh,
dirty laundry workout.

803
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:25,083
Hey, only one person
I know can pull off a hairpin back flip dash.

804
00:48:25,166 --> 00:48:28,833
Oh, that wasn't
a hairpin back flip dash.

805
00:48:28,916 --> 00:48:30,458
Uh-uh. No way.

806
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:34,458
It was a wheeze moth
undercarriage sachet.

807
00:48:34,541 --> 00:48:36,458
- No.
- Hm-mm.

808
00:48:36,541 --> 00:48:39,166
But even if it was,
I also only know one person can pull off

809
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,375
a wheeze moth
undercarriage sachet.

810
00:48:41,458 --> 00:48:43,458
My daughter.

811
00:48:43,541 --> 00:48:48,500
I need to go and polish
my nose ring collection. Yeah, I got one of them.

812
00:48:48,583 --> 00:48:52,416
And I need to get my
crystal ball.

813
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,916
Freeze.

814
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,791
Ah, nice going in you
big mouth pot house.

815
00:48:56,875 --> 00:49:00,166
Okay, out with it.
What's going on?

816
00:49:08,291 --> 00:49:10,458
What are you up to?

817
00:50:06,708 --> 00:50:09,333
<i>And Erwin has taken the win.</i>

818
00:50:09,416 --> 00:50:12,041
<i>Can anyone stop this mouse?</i>

819
00:50:12,125 --> 00:50:15,916
<i>And today, Erwin,</i>
<i>the legendary driver...</i>

820
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,666
Dad.

821
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:20,166
<i>is leaving</i>
<i>the Grand Prix of Europe.</i>

822
00:50:21,791 --> 00:50:25,541
Talented racer. Friend of yours?

823
00:50:25,625 --> 00:50:27,791
Actually, he's my, uh.

824
00:50:27,875 --> 00:50:31,208
Uh, no. I don't know him.

825
00:50:31,291 --> 00:50:33,333
Are you following me?

826
00:50:33,416 --> 00:50:36,583
No, no, no, no.
I just happen to be walking in the same direction

827
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:38,916
and slightly behind you.

828
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,416
That's all.

829
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,166
Good.

830
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:46,208
People who don't stay in their
own lane tend to get hurt.

831
00:50:54,833 --> 00:50:59,208
Wait, and my daughter
has actually been racing as Ed this whole time?

832
00:50:59,291 --> 00:51:01,208
Hmm-mm. Yes.

833
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:04,708
And you saw everything
you just told me in your crystal ball?

834
00:51:04,791 --> 00:51:07,583
Yes, I know all that

835
00:51:07,666 --> 00:51:13,166
just as I know a peculiar
shade of blue

836
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:16,833
is going to ruin
your lunch late next week.

837
00:51:16,916 --> 00:51:18,291
Impressive.

838
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:20,958
Especially since
that's a grapefruit, Rosa.

839
00:51:21,041 --> 00:51:23,416
Jorge, just because
you are a bull

840
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,583
doesn't mean
you can give me any. - Hey.

841
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:28,166
As a bull, I find that
a little offensive. Okay?

842
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:32,208
But anyway, the truth,
Edda told us all of it

843
00:51:32,291 --> 00:51:34,458
and wanted us to keep
it a secret from you.

844
00:51:34,541 --> 00:51:35,791
Oh, please don't hate us.

845
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,875
We're about to lose the park
and she runs off the drive in the Grand Prix of Europe?

846
00:51:40,958 --> 00:51:44,958
Hey, Rosa,
anything in that crystal ball of yours about us being fired?

847
00:51:45,041 --> 00:51:46,625
And she didn't feel
like she could

848
00:51:46,708 --> 00:51:50,458
even tell her own father
because who am I kidding?

849
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:54,083
I wouldn't listen anyway,
all I think about is the business.

850
00:51:54,166 --> 00:51:55,666
We should start packing, right?

851
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:58,875
No one's getting fired.
We're her family.

852
00:51:58,958 --> 00:52:01,083
We should be together,
shouldn't we?

853
00:52:01,166 --> 00:52:02,208
Well, shouldn't we?

854
00:52:02,291 --> 00:52:03,541
- Yes.
- Of course.

855
00:52:03,625 --> 00:52:05,041
I thought
you were asking yourself.

856
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:06,500
Yes. Together is better.

857
00:52:06,583 --> 00:52:08,708
We should. Then it's settled.

858
00:52:08,791 --> 00:52:10,791
And more importantly,

859
00:52:10,875 --> 00:52:14,666
I am not missing
my daughter driving in the Grand Prix of Europe.

860
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:17,041
- Would you?
- Of course not.

861
00:52:17,125 --> 00:52:18,625
Hm-mm.

862
00:52:18,708 --> 00:52:20,583
But how are we gonna get there?
It's really far.

863
00:52:37,208 --> 00:52:39,458
My snow-lder plan failed.

864
00:52:40,708 --> 00:52:44,500
But after this next trick,
I'm bound to win.

865
00:52:44,583 --> 00:52:46,500
My career will be on fire.

866
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:52,166
Oh, no. Actual fire!

867
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,666
Everyone stay calm.

868
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:58,166
We have everything
under control.

869
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:00,000
There is no danger.

870
00:53:00,083 --> 00:53:01,500
What the heck is going on?

871
00:53:01,583 --> 00:53:03,041
We're all gonna die!

872
00:53:03,125 --> 00:53:05,708
Um, your mic is still on.

873
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:09,833
Oh. Ha-ha!

874
00:53:09,916 --> 00:53:14,416
We're all gonna die
trying to stop this so no one die dies.

875
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,250
Ha-ha-ha!

876
00:53:18,666 --> 00:53:22,166
Magnus, what is going on here?

877
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:25,458
Oh, just a little baking mishap.

878
00:53:25,541 --> 00:53:27,875
I accidentally
burned some muffins.

879
00:53:27,958 --> 00:53:31,541
The worst part, I was
making them for all of you.

880
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:32,958
Aw.

881
00:53:36,458 --> 00:53:37,458
Hmm.

882
00:53:37,541 --> 00:53:38,708
What's this?

883
00:53:38,791 --> 00:53:41,666
It's my muffin
icing caramalizer.

884
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:44,250
It's what accidentally
caused the fire.

885
00:53:44,333 --> 00:53:47,375
I don't see any burnt muffins.

886
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:50,958
They disintegrated.

887
00:53:51,041 --> 00:53:53,708
It's the settings on
this crazy caramelizer.

888
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:55,333
Must be faulty.

889
00:53:57,125 --> 00:53:59,208
Ow. Faulty.

890
00:53:59,291 --> 00:54:00,250
See?

891
00:54:00,333 --> 00:54:01,875
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

892
00:54:01,958 --> 00:54:05,041
Okay, crisis over.
Back to your suites, everyone.

893
00:54:05,125 --> 00:54:06,708
Thank you all.

894
00:54:06,791 --> 00:54:10,541
Now I think I lie down
and take a good long nippy nap

895
00:54:10,625 --> 00:54:13,208
to be ready for tomorrow.

896
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:14,958
Good call.

897
00:54:15,041 --> 00:54:20,250
You'll need plenty of rest
to almost come in first again.

898
00:54:24,166 --> 00:54:26,083
I'll show them.

899
00:54:26,166 --> 00:54:29,166
No more Mr. Nice bear.

900
00:54:30,666 --> 00:54:35,166
Ed and Nachtkraab
are going down hard.

901
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:38,333
And then I will
finally be victorious.

902
00:54:40,541 --> 00:54:41,625
Ow.

903
00:54:43,875 --> 00:54:45,166
It's him!

904
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:46,583
It's him!

905
00:54:47,708 --> 00:54:49,000
It's him!

906
00:54:49,083 --> 00:54:50,541
What are you talking about?

907
00:54:50,625 --> 00:54:53,583
Nachtkraab is sabotaging
the race.

908
00:54:53,666 --> 00:54:55,250
First he threatens me

909
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:58,250
and now he's trying to put
the blame on poor Magnus.

910
00:54:58,333 --> 00:54:59,750
Where's your proof?

911
00:55:00,333 --> 00:55:04,791
Well, I don't have
any actual evidence,

912
00:55:04,875 --> 00:55:07,125
but what I do have
is better than that.

913
00:55:07,208 --> 00:55:08,416
What?

914
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,750
A really strong feeling
I'm right.

915
00:55:10,833 --> 00:55:12,916
So we have
to do something about it.

916
00:55:14,291 --> 00:55:15,625
How about this?

917
00:55:15,708 --> 00:55:17,291
Let's focus on this next race,

918
00:55:17,375 --> 00:55:19,666
and if there's any hint
of sabotage this time,

919
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:22,458
I promise to help you find
whoever it is.

920
00:55:22,541 --> 00:55:25,458
Really? You'd do that?

921
00:55:25,541 --> 00:55:28,791
Whether I like it or not,
we're a team.

922
00:55:30,875 --> 00:55:33,000
Thank you.

923
00:55:33,666 --> 00:55:35,208
You really promise?

924
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:36,916
Hm-mm.

925
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,875
Okay, because if you don't,
I swear, when I get home,

926
00:55:40,958 --> 00:55:43,708
I'll replace all your
posters with Bockli's.

927
00:55:43,791 --> 00:55:45,750
Okay, that's going too far.

928
00:55:45,833 --> 00:55:49,500
And I'll ask him
to sign all my pillow cases.

929
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,958
Buckle up folks,
with 20 racers

930
00:56:00,041 --> 00:56:02,750
revving their engines, there's
no time to stop at admire

931
00:56:02,833 --> 00:56:04,958
the gorgeous Italian coast.

932
00:56:11,416 --> 00:56:12,666
Don't overtake yet.

933
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:14,333
He's right there.

934
00:56:14,416 --> 00:56:15,708
Remember our deal.

935
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:18,458
Do as I say.

936
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,166
This is so frustrating.

937
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:21,708
How do you think I feel?

938
00:56:21,791 --> 00:56:22,958
Hmm.

939
00:56:23,041 --> 00:56:24,458
Vain? Big-headed?

940
00:56:24,541 --> 00:56:26,458
Worried about
your receding hairline?

941
00:56:26,541 --> 00:56:29,125
My hair is thick and lustrous.

942
00:56:29,208 --> 00:56:32,208
Made you check though.

943
00:56:32,291 --> 00:56:34,166
Is it true what they say, Peri?

944
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:37,458
Is Italy really
the land of romance?

945
00:56:38,708 --> 00:56:39,916
Whoa. Easy there, Peri.

946
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,291
Children are watching.

947
00:56:41,375 --> 00:56:44,208
So, Cindy, it's about
time for some obstacles.

948
00:56:44,291 --> 00:56:47,291
What are we gonna see
from you on the tracks today?

949
00:56:47,375 --> 00:56:51,041
How about some sea monsters?

950
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:07,666
Wow, they really need
to cut Cindy's budget.

951
00:57:14,708 --> 00:57:15,791
Whoa!

952
00:57:20,458 --> 00:57:21,583
Whoa.

953
00:57:27,708 --> 00:57:29,500
Nice driving!

954
00:57:29,583 --> 00:57:32,041
Ed, is that a compliment?

955
00:57:32,125 --> 00:57:34,250
Enjoy it.
There won't be another one.

956
00:57:34,333 --> 00:57:36,958
Now keep left into this hairpin.

957
00:57:37,041 --> 00:57:38,958
Whatever you say, boss.

958
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,541
Ooh, I went left.

959
00:57:43,625 --> 00:57:45,500
Left him in the dust.

960
00:57:55,458 --> 00:57:57,750
Oh, nice try, fish breath!

961
00:57:57,833 --> 00:58:00,166
That's off the scale.

962
00:58:01,083 --> 00:58:02,625
You are kraken me up.

963
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,041
In the lead,
a thrilling clash unfolds

964
00:58:08,125 --> 00:58:10,416
between Nachtkraab and Magnus.

965
00:58:15,833 --> 00:58:18,375
Okay, team
captain, what's the play?

966
00:58:18,458 --> 00:58:20,958
You know what, Edda?
Do your thing.

967
00:58:21,041 --> 00:58:22,666
You've got this.

968
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:24,416
Seriously? You mean it?

969
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,291
Don't make me say it twice.

970
00:58:26,375 --> 00:58:28,958
If I swallow any more pride,
I'll choke.

971
00:58:29,041 --> 00:58:31,375
Okay, watch this.

972
00:58:31,458 --> 00:58:33,958
And Ed suddenly enters
the scene

973
00:58:34,041 --> 00:58:35,625
ready to shake things up!

974
00:58:35,708 --> 00:58:37,291
Go, Ed!

975
00:58:37,375 --> 00:58:41,250
Surely the race
belongs to one of these three.

976
00:58:41,333 --> 00:58:45,666
Oh, what's that smell?
Smells familiar.

977
00:58:48,208 --> 00:58:49,333
What are you doing?

978
00:58:49,416 --> 00:58:50,375
It's, it's not me!

979
00:58:50,458 --> 00:58:52,166
It's like I'm being blown back

980
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:55,625
by an invisible burst
of air or something!

981
00:58:55,708 --> 00:58:59,541
What the.

982
00:59:07,166 --> 00:59:08,291
Nachtkraab!

983
00:59:09,958 --> 00:59:11,291
It's got to be you.

984
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,333
Is between Magnus
and Nachtkraab!

985
00:59:15,416 --> 00:59:16,916
The bears slipping behind.

986
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,708
He's gotta be raving mad.

987
00:59:18,791 --> 00:59:19,958
No!

988
00:59:20,041 --> 00:59:23,291
Nachtkraab comes in first!

989
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:32,541
What are doing?

990
00:59:32,625 --> 00:59:34,250
How did you come third?

991
00:59:34,333 --> 00:59:36,166
That was the worst.

992
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:37,916
But, but where are you going?

993
00:59:38,833 --> 00:59:40,000
Stop it.

994
00:59:40,083 --> 00:59:41,708
This is against the rules.

995
00:59:41,791 --> 00:59:43,375
So is sabotage.

996
00:59:43,458 --> 00:59:47,333
There's gotta be some sort
of jet or air cannon or...

997
00:59:48,583 --> 00:59:50,208
Didn't you promise you'd help me

998
00:59:50,291 --> 00:59:53,125
if there was even a hint
of sabotage?

999
00:59:53,208 --> 00:59:56,791
The only saboteur
I see right now is you.

1000
00:59:58,583 --> 01:00:01,583
You may want to stop
doing that to my car

1001
01:00:01,666 --> 01:00:04,083
because if Cindy sees you.

1002
01:00:05,916 --> 01:00:08,708
My office now!

1003
01:00:08,791 --> 01:00:12,416
Oops. Too late.

1004
01:00:16,833 --> 01:00:18,625
Magnificent job, Jorge.

1005
01:00:18,708 --> 01:00:21,041
This is the best thing
you've built

1006
01:00:21,125 --> 01:00:23,500
since the amusement park rides.

1007
01:00:23,583 --> 01:00:25,583
Gracia.

1008
01:00:25,666 --> 01:00:28,291
Of course it did help that I got
to build it using the amusement park rides.

1009
01:00:29,916 --> 01:00:32,416
And just in time
to make it to the final race.

1010
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:35,958
Rosa, do you foresee any
disaster on the water for us?

1011
01:00:37,541 --> 01:00:39,500
None.

1012
01:00:39,583 --> 01:00:42,666
But it looked like the earth
got a few more equator lines. Hmm.

1013
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:45,458
London. Here we come!

1014
01:00:45,541 --> 01:00:47,250
Whoo-hoo!

1015
01:00:48,083 --> 01:00:51,083
Ed, Ed, Ed, Ed, Ed, Ed, Ed!

1016
01:00:52,208 --> 01:00:54,500
Look, I get it's
a stressful time.

1017
01:00:54,583 --> 01:00:56,291
Though most people deal
with stress

1018
01:00:56,375 --> 01:00:58,125
by overeating or nail biting.

1019
01:00:58,208 --> 01:01:01,125
Not tearing apart
an opponent's race car

1020
01:01:01,208 --> 01:01:03,500
in front of 50,000 fans!

1021
01:01:03,583 --> 01:01:07,000
You are just lucky as the
biggest star of the racing world

1022
01:01:07,083 --> 01:01:09,916
that I need you
as much as you need me.

1023
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,625
Give me your word this
will never happen again.

1024
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:18,708
In the final race, you will have

1025
01:01:18,791 --> 01:01:21,250
to start in the penalty box.

1026
01:01:21,333 --> 01:01:26,083
Meaning you'll start one minute
later than everyone else.

1027
01:01:26,166 --> 01:01:28,166
Is that clear?

1028
01:01:35,166 --> 01:01:38,375
Well, well, well, if
it isn't the Ed head.

1029
01:01:38,458 --> 01:01:40,833
You must be super bummed.

1030
01:01:40,916 --> 01:01:43,875
Cindy's still chewing
him out in there, no?

1031
01:01:43,958 --> 01:01:47,000
Now that you've spent
time with him, sweetie,

1032
01:01:47,083 --> 01:01:48,833
you can tell us.

1033
01:01:48,916 --> 01:01:50,625
Ed's a real pain, right?

1034
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:52,083
Yeah.

1035
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:55,375
What's it like to work
for such a, how you say,

1036
01:01:55,458 --> 01:01:57,250
radioactive poo poo head.

1037
01:01:58,625 --> 01:02:00,041
Hey, hey. Come on, guys.

1038
01:02:00,125 --> 01:02:01,875
Don't put him
on a spot like that.

1039
01:02:01,958 --> 01:02:04,250
There's a rumor
the reason Ed doesn't talk

1040
01:02:04,333 --> 01:02:08,375
to anyone is because he's
embarrassed about his breath.

1041
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:11,583
Supposedly, he smells
like foot cheese.

1042
01:02:11,666 --> 01:02:12,791
Is that true?

1043
01:02:25,458 --> 01:02:29,750
One minute behind. One minute!

1044
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:32,958
And for what? Some crazy
hunch about Nachtkraab?

1045
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:35,666
It wasn't a crazy hunch.

1046
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:39,333
It was a a very strong feeling.

1047
01:02:39,416 --> 01:02:42,583
Feelings.
Feelings don't win races.

1048
01:02:42,666 --> 01:02:44,166
I told you that.

1049
01:02:44,250 --> 01:02:46,791
And now they're gonna
lose me the championship.

1050
01:02:46,875 --> 01:02:49,208
I know, I'm sorry,
but I'll find a way to fix it.

1051
01:02:49,291 --> 01:02:50,750
I know I can.

1052
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:52,666
No, you won't.

1053
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:54,625
I'm fed up
with you fixing things.

1054
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,416
Give that back.

1055
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:17,916
What's this?

1056
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,708
Right now!

1057
01:03:19,791 --> 01:03:22,000
I'm your friend.

1058
01:03:22,083 --> 01:03:23,625
I don't have friends.

1059
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:31,250
You're right. You don't.

1060
01:03:39,083 --> 01:03:41,625
That guy thinks
his exhaust doesn't stink!

1061
01:03:41,708 --> 01:03:43,208
So arrogant.

1062
01:03:43,291 --> 01:03:47,208
Has he always been this
weird and butt-headed?

1063
01:03:47,291 --> 01:03:49,291
And what's with that sketchbook?

1064
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:53,958
The arrogance I can
only guess is a shield

1065
01:03:54,041 --> 01:03:57,583
to keep people
from getting close.

1066
01:03:57,666 --> 01:04:02,416
But the sketchbook
I know quite well.

1067
01:04:04,041 --> 01:04:07,250
Ed grew up in an orphanage.

1068
01:04:07,333 --> 01:04:10,125
It was actually
a pretty happy place

1069
01:04:10,208 --> 01:04:13,125
and all the kids became friends.

1070
01:04:13,208 --> 01:04:15,333
Who's the best road trip crew
by far?

1071
01:04:15,416 --> 01:04:18,083
<i>♪ We are. We are! ♪</i>

1072
01:04:18,166 --> 01:04:21,125
Who sticks together
just like glue?

1073
01:04:21,208 --> 01:04:25,208
<i>♪ We do! We do! ♪</i>

1074
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,750
Ed and his fellow orphans
all dreamed

1075
01:04:36,833 --> 01:04:41,041
of becoming
a racing team together when they grew up.

1076
01:04:41,125 --> 01:04:43,750
We'll be
the best racing team ever.

1077
01:04:45,041 --> 01:04:50,041
But then, as each of his
friends found a new home,

1078
01:04:51,666 --> 01:04:57,708
Ed's dream team became
smaller and smaller until

1079
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,666
it wasn't even a team at all.

1080
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,583
Who's the best road trip crew
by far?

1081
01:05:26,666 --> 01:05:31,041
<i>♪ We are. We are ♪</i>

1082
01:05:31,583 --> 01:05:34,208
Ed decided from that day forward

1083
01:05:34,291 --> 01:05:38,500
to not depend on anybody
except himself.

1084
01:05:38,583 --> 01:05:40,750
How do you know all of this?

1085
01:05:42,041 --> 01:05:45,666
Because I was one of them.

1086
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:52,291
When Ed and I met years
later on the circuit,

1087
01:05:52,375 --> 01:05:55,375
he wanted nothing to do with me.

1088
01:05:59,375 --> 01:06:01,833
And he still doesn't.

1089
01:06:25,041 --> 01:06:26,416
What?

1090
01:06:34,875 --> 01:06:36,083
Ha ha!

1091
01:06:38,375 --> 01:06:39,750
Healed.

1092
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:42,291
Time to drive

1093
01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:45,500
Poor Ed.

1094
01:06:49,166 --> 01:06:52,833
That smell. I know that smell.

1095
01:06:54,458 --> 01:06:56,958
This is the smell
I smelled during the race.

1096
01:06:57,958 --> 01:07:03,666
And that means the smell
should lead me right to

1097
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:06,458
Nachtkra!

1098
01:07:09,333 --> 01:07:10,916
Magnus' suite?

1099
01:08:02,833 --> 01:08:06,458
Whatever it is,
it's here somewhere.

1100
01:08:10,125 --> 01:08:12,125
You're number two.

1101
01:08:17,916 --> 01:08:19,208
You did fine.

1102
01:08:21,583 --> 01:08:22,750
So, so.

1103
01:08:24,458 --> 01:08:26,416
First place, just kidding.

1104
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:31,041
Oh, who am I kidding? There's
no way it's Mag-.

1105
01:08:32,333 --> 01:08:34,791
A secret laboratory?

1106
01:08:36,125 --> 01:08:37,208
I knew it.

1107
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:42,166
Invisible grease, Paris race.

1108
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:45,125
Air blaster, Italy race.

1109
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,458
The same smell.

1110
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:53,250
I was so right
and I was so wrong.

1111
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:56,416
Magnetic drone, London.

1112
01:08:57,458 --> 01:09:00,041
This must be the next
sabotage he's planning.

1113
01:09:00,125 --> 01:09:01,958
I need to get this to Cindy.

1114
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,458
Oh!

1115
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:32,333
I-- I must have lost my key.

1116
01:09:32,416 --> 01:09:34,250
Hey, it happens to everybody.

1117
01:09:34,333 --> 01:09:35,750
I must get in there.

1118
01:09:35,833 --> 01:09:37,166
No problem.

1119
01:09:38,041 --> 01:09:38,958
Just a second.

1120
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:40,625
Thank you.

1121
01:09:40,708 --> 01:09:43,583
I could have sworn I had
my key with me when I left.

1122
01:09:43,666 --> 01:09:45,458
My pleasure.

1123
01:09:46,291 --> 01:09:47,500
What?

1124
01:09:54,541 --> 01:09:56,416
Everyone loves Magnus,

1125
01:09:56,500 --> 01:10:00,208
the good old bear
who always comes second.

1126
01:10:00,291 --> 01:10:04,458
But tomorrow
I'll be second to none!

1127
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:20,916
Okay, I admit I was
wrong about Nachtkraab.

1128
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,166
He's not a cheater.

1129
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:23,541
That's very big of you.

1130
01:10:23,625 --> 01:10:25,125
And why did you decide that?

1131
01:10:25,208 --> 01:10:27,458
Because I now know Magnus is!

1132
01:10:27,541 --> 01:10:28,791
Magnus?

1133
01:10:28,875 --> 01:10:30,541
Even I like Magnus.

1134
01:10:30,625 --> 01:10:32,625
Oh, he is the last one
I'd suspect.

1135
01:10:32,708 --> 01:10:34,958
You've been hanging around
car exhaust too long.

1136
01:10:35,041 --> 01:10:36,583
Ed, Ed! I saw it. Something.

1137
01:10:36,666 --> 01:10:39,083
I don't know what Magnus'
final sabotage will be,

1138
01:10:39,166 --> 01:10:41,458
but now I know
he has one planned.

1139
01:10:41,541 --> 01:10:42,916
Hm-mm. You're fired.

1140
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,125
You bet I'm fired! Fired up!

1141
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:47,541
I feel so alive.

1142
01:10:47,625 --> 01:10:51,250
This time I saw proof
with my own eyes.

1143
01:10:51,333 --> 01:10:52,750
No, you are fired fired.

1144
01:10:52,833 --> 01:10:54,875
I don't need you
to drive as me anymore.

1145
01:10:56,625 --> 01:10:57,916
See?

1146
01:11:00,833 --> 01:11:02,416
So.

1147
01:11:04,375 --> 01:11:07,791
Oh, that's great.

1148
01:11:07,875 --> 01:11:09,833
But what about saving
the park, and...

1149
01:11:09,916 --> 01:11:12,750
Once I win, you'll be paid
accordingly for your time.

1150
01:11:12,833 --> 01:11:16,333
Now, if you'll excuse, I need
to focus on today's race.

1151
01:11:18,166 --> 01:11:20,083
It's not about the money.

1152
01:11:20,166 --> 01:11:22,666
Well, well, some of it's
about the money.

1153
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:24,166
But how can you be like this

1154
01:11:24,250 --> 01:11:26,125
after all we've been through?

1155
01:11:26,208 --> 01:11:27,833
I thought we were getting close.

1156
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:30,833
You are a good guy deep
down, very deep down.

1157
01:11:30,916 --> 01:11:32,208
But it's there.

1158
01:11:32,291 --> 01:11:33,958
I believed in you, Edda.

1159
01:11:34,041 --> 01:11:37,125
You just couldn't let go of
this whole conspiracy thing.

1160
01:11:37,208 --> 01:11:39,208
You could have been
one of the greats,

1161
01:11:39,291 --> 01:11:42,375
not off the charts once in
a lifetime great like me,

1162
01:11:42,458 --> 01:11:44,166
but, you know, regular great.

1163
01:11:46,166 --> 01:11:49,583
Don't do to me what all your
orphan friends did to you.

1164
01:11:49,666 --> 01:11:51,708
You don't wanna close
that door, Ed.

1165
01:11:51,791 --> 01:11:53,958
Maybe on my dream,
I can deal with that.

1166
01:11:54,041 --> 01:11:55,625
But not on our friendship

1167
01:11:55,708 --> 01:12:00,291
or any friendship
in your case, do you?

1168
01:12:16,083 --> 01:12:18,958
Welcome to London
and the thrilling final race

1169
01:12:19,041 --> 01:12:20,916
of the Grand Prix!

1170
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,500
Outta 40 drivers,
there's only 10 left.

1171
01:12:23,583 --> 01:12:24,958
And I've gotta say, Peri,

1172
01:12:25,041 --> 01:12:27,000
it's been
an unusual one this year.

1173
01:12:27,083 --> 01:12:28,625
What do you think about it all?

1174
01:12:30,166 --> 01:12:32,666
Whoa! Chillax Peri!

1175
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:34,416
I've never seen you so excited,

1176
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:35,833
but who can blame you?

1177
01:12:35,916 --> 01:12:37,291
Let's go now to Cindy,

1178
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:39,750
who'll take us through
today's thrilling route.

1179
01:12:39,833 --> 01:12:42,958
That's right, Enzo.
We've prepared a wild one.

1180
01:12:43,041 --> 01:12:45,541
Drivers will first encounter
Tower Bridge,

1181
01:12:45,625 --> 01:12:47,333
then onto Big Ben,

1182
01:12:47,416 --> 01:12:50,208
and beware drivers don't
let this bus catch you.

1183
01:12:50,291 --> 01:12:54,291
Oh, nein. They really
need to cut Cindy's budget.

1184
01:13:01,791 --> 01:13:04,750
The race is about to start.
Look, there she is.

1185
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:09,083
Edda!

1186
01:13:09,166 --> 01:13:11,208
Woo-hoo-hoo!

1187
01:13:14,666 --> 01:13:16,333
Edda. Huh?

1188
01:13:16,416 --> 01:13:17,666
Edda?

1189
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:20,125
Dad, fancy seeing you here.

1190
01:13:20,208 --> 01:13:24,125
Jorge and Rosa told me
you are driving for Ed.

1191
01:13:24,208 --> 01:13:26,333
And you are not mad?

1192
01:13:26,416 --> 01:13:29,416
Of course I'm mad at myself.

1193
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:32,791
I just wanted to keep you
at home a little longer.

1194
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:35,291
You are a brilliant driver,
Edda.

1195
01:13:35,375 --> 01:13:37,166
I should have supported you.

1196
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:39,666
And that's what I'm
going to do from now on.

1197
01:13:41,458 --> 01:13:42,750
Can you forgive me?

1198
01:13:42,833 --> 01:13:45,458
I got everything so wrong.

1199
01:13:45,541 --> 01:13:47,541
Maybe I'm not cut out
for racing.

1200
01:13:47,625 --> 01:13:51,708
Of course you are,
talking of which, why aren't you in your car?

1201
01:13:51,791 --> 01:13:56,125
I kind of got fired,
made some big mistakes

1202
01:13:56,208 --> 01:13:57,750
and now Ed's in danger.

1203
01:13:58,708 --> 01:13:59,916
They all are.

1204
01:14:02,541 --> 01:14:06,458
The cars ready and the
race is about to begin.

1205
01:14:07,250 --> 01:14:09,708
Just one more thing
to take care of.

1206
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:12,333
It's the penalty box.

1207
01:14:12,416 --> 01:14:15,833
Ed has to stay in there
for one minute.

1208
01:14:24,166 --> 01:14:29,833
Now we can ready, set, go!

1209
01:14:29,916 --> 01:14:32,541
And they're off!

1210
01:14:41,041 --> 01:14:43,375
Ed. Ed!

1211
01:14:43,458 --> 01:14:44,916
It's me, Edda.

1212
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,958
Ed, please believe me
about Magnus.

1213
01:14:47,041 --> 01:14:49,166
- Oh, I believe.
- Oh, you do?

1214
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:54,166
You are the most annoying
individual I have ever met.

1215
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:57,666
Ed. Ed, can you hear me?

1216
01:15:00,416 --> 01:15:01,875
Ed's penalty is over.

1217
01:15:01,958 --> 01:15:05,458
And there he goes, yeah!

1218
01:15:06,625 --> 01:15:08,375
Yeah!

1219
01:15:09,583 --> 01:15:11,333
This is unbelievable.

1220
01:15:11,416 --> 01:15:12,583
Excuse me. Sorry.

1221
01:15:12,666 --> 01:15:14,666
Mind me, coming through.

1222
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:17,583
He's taken Louis
and he's coming up on Carlos.

1223
01:15:18,541 --> 01:15:20,458
Time to wrap this up.

1224
01:15:20,541 --> 01:15:22,666
Whoo-hoo!

1225
01:15:31,750 --> 01:15:33,125
Not quite.

1226
01:15:36,916 --> 01:15:38,208
Welcome to the bus stop.

1227
01:15:40,666 --> 01:15:43,208
Now that's what I call
a fair dodger.

1228
01:15:44,416 --> 01:15:47,666
Hm.

1229
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:48,750
Need a lift?

1230
01:15:51,708 --> 01:15:52,625
Eric.

1231
01:15:52,708 --> 01:15:55,125
It's a brutal race folks.

1232
01:15:55,208 --> 01:15:56,916
Magnus has to be behind
that crash,

1233
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,125
but I can't see how.

1234
01:15:58,208 --> 01:16:00,875
What's next?
Anyone got crystal ball?

1235
01:16:02,791 --> 01:16:07,458
Oh, I, I'm getting something.

1236
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:16,000
Danger below
will threaten triumph above.

1237
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:20,291
Look down. Look down.

1238
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:22,125
Look down.

1239
01:16:23,291 --> 01:16:25,250
A drone.

1240
01:16:25,333 --> 01:16:29,250
That's it. Magnus must have
drones underneath the track.

1241
01:16:30,458 --> 01:16:32,208
Rosa was right.

1242
01:16:32,291 --> 01:16:36,666
I was?
I mean, aye, of course I was.

1243
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:39,166
But what is he using them for?

1244
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:41,041
And how do we stop them?

1245
01:16:44,166 --> 01:16:48,125
You're gonna need these.
You go Edda, save the day.

1246
01:16:52,166 --> 01:16:53,708
Now all I have to do is,

1247
01:16:55,708 --> 01:16:57,375
breathe through my mouth.

1248
01:16:59,916 --> 01:17:01,666
Ha ha.

1249
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:02,791
Balloon gas tank.

1250
01:17:12,625 --> 01:17:14,416
Whoa. Okay.

1251
01:17:24,333 --> 01:17:29,041
Whoa, whoa!

1252
01:17:29,125 --> 01:17:30,833
Edda, are you there?

1253
01:17:30,916 --> 01:17:33,208
Drones? He's got drones.

1254
01:17:33,291 --> 01:17:36,541
I've got eyes on a whole swarm
of drones down here in the sewer.

1255
01:17:36,625 --> 01:17:37,750
You are in the sewer?

1256
01:17:37,833 --> 01:17:39,750
And what are you talking
about drones?

1257
01:17:39,833 --> 01:17:41,458
Right under you.

1258
01:17:41,541 --> 01:17:43,458
Magnus is using these things
to control the cars above.

1259
01:17:43,541 --> 01:17:45,166
Shockingly, I don't believe you.

1260
01:17:45,250 --> 01:17:46,750
I'll prove it.

1261
01:17:49,291 --> 01:17:51,875
There should be a car up
there spinning out of control.

1262
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:53,875
Yes. Mine!

1263
01:17:53,958 --> 01:17:56,041
I believe you. I believe you!

1264
01:17:56,125 --> 01:17:58,875
Uh-oh, I don't think
they like to be punched.

1265
01:17:58,958 --> 01:18:01,166
Ah, they can shoot lasers.

1266
01:18:02,125 --> 01:18:04,333
Okay. I'll deal
with Magnus up here.

1267
01:18:04,416 --> 01:18:06,666
And I'll deal
with the drones down here.

1268
01:18:13,833 --> 01:18:15,625
That's a knockout.

1269
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:17,791
Ed, you're all clear.

1270
01:18:18,416 --> 01:18:20,791
Ha-ha!

1271
01:18:23,166 --> 01:18:24,750
Hi.

1272
01:18:28,375 --> 01:18:30,291
What? What?

1273
01:18:30,375 --> 01:18:32,208
Let's pump things up.

1274
01:18:36,083 --> 01:18:39,000
This cheating
is getting very tiresome.

1275
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:58,958
Would you like your ice cream
in a cone or in your face?

1276
01:19:07,083 --> 01:19:09,458
No! My drones!

1277
01:19:09,541 --> 01:19:10,791
What happened?

1278
01:19:10,875 --> 01:19:13,583
Computer, show me
what we have left.

1279
01:19:13,666 --> 01:19:17,166
I will take care of you,
whoever you are.

1280
01:19:18,708 --> 01:19:20,916
Ed's back in the action.

1281
01:19:23,666 --> 01:19:26,416
Okay, let's get this race
back on track.

1282
01:19:30,250 --> 01:19:31,708
Huh?

1283
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:42,458
Come on.
Can't a bear just sit in peace?

1284
01:19:42,541 --> 01:19:45,041
This is a dream come true

1285
01:19:45,125 --> 01:19:48,041
for the best driver of all time.

1286
01:19:50,791 --> 01:19:52,000
Ed!

1287
01:19:52,083 --> 01:19:53,166
Edda?

1288
01:19:56,125 --> 01:19:58,166
Um, is that
an underground train

1289
01:19:58,250 --> 01:20:00,250
rising into the sky?

1290
01:20:00,333 --> 01:20:02,458
That's a change from
the scheduled service.

1291
01:20:05,916 --> 01:20:07,666
Edda, I'm coming. Hold on.

1292
01:20:11,583 --> 01:20:14,041
Wait, what is Ed doing?

1293
01:20:14,125 --> 01:20:17,583
I win. I'm first!

1294
01:20:24,166 --> 01:20:26,000
What is happening?

1295
01:20:31,208 --> 01:20:32,500
Edda, are you all right?

1296
01:20:32,583 --> 01:20:33,791
Uh, yeah.

1297
01:20:34,666 --> 01:20:36,166
No, not really.

1298
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:38,791
Oh, no. The train's
heading for the stand.

1299
01:20:38,875 --> 01:20:41,291
Oh, I'll never make it in time.

1300
01:20:42,583 --> 01:20:44,000
Okay.

1301
01:20:44,083 --> 01:20:46,541
Thank goodness no one's
ever cut Cindy's budget.

1302
01:21:23,708 --> 01:21:24,833
Hmm, ah!

1303
01:21:25,708 --> 01:21:28,500
I said no vanilla!

1304
01:21:32,583 --> 01:21:35,708
How on earth
did you pull that move off?

1305
01:21:35,791 --> 01:21:39,208
You mean the pendulum
Whack River jump Surprise?

1306
01:21:43,791 --> 01:21:48,833
I just didn't think about
it like someone I know.

1307
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:51,375
Hmm.

1308
01:21:53,958 --> 01:21:56,958
In all the
excitement, it's easy to forget

1309
01:21:57,041 --> 01:22:00,583
we've got
a first time winner, Magnus.

1310
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:01,708
I won!

1311
01:22:03,833 --> 01:22:06,416
Finally.

1312
01:22:23,958 --> 01:22:27,000
Oh, Magnus, how could you?

1313
01:22:27,083 --> 01:22:28,250
Oh.

1314
01:22:29,083 --> 01:22:31,916
Look, Edda, they've got him.

1315
01:22:39,208 --> 01:22:40,791
You were so close.

1316
01:22:41,791 --> 01:22:44,166
Saving me cost you
becoming a legend.

1317
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:47,000
I got something
far more valuable.

1318
01:22:47,083 --> 01:22:50,416
You gave me back my dream
to be part of a team.

1319
01:22:59,833 --> 01:23:03,541
You both did great.
That was a real race.

1320
01:23:07,083 --> 01:23:09,958
Bring it in, my old friend.

1321
01:23:11,125 --> 01:23:13,625
Bockli!

1322
01:23:21,583 --> 01:23:24,333
With Magnus disqualified,

1323
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:30,250
the trophy goes
to second place, Nachtkraab!

1324
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,666
Where is he? He was just...

1325
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:35,166
I'm here.

1326
01:23:36,208 --> 01:23:38,916
I really need to know
how you do that.

1327
01:23:40,458 --> 01:23:42,375
Thank you, Cindy.

1328
01:23:42,458 --> 01:23:46,708
But there's someone here
who deserves this trophy more than I.

1329
01:23:48,250 --> 01:23:52,125
In a world full
of egoism and selfishness,

1330
01:23:52,208 --> 01:23:56,583
you can recognize true
heroes by their team spirit,

1331
01:23:56,666 --> 01:24:00,916
their courage
and their self-sacrifice

1332
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,750
in standing up
for what is right.

1333
01:24:09,583 --> 01:24:12,458
Your daughter is an
excellent driver, Erwin.

1334
01:24:12,541 --> 01:24:13,958
Wait, you know?

1335
01:24:15,208 --> 01:24:19,958
I recognize a rocket
ramp spin flip sky ride when I see one.

1336
01:24:20,750 --> 01:24:25,583
Oh, I dunno what
to say other than, sorry.

1337
01:24:25,666 --> 01:24:27,291
I thought you were the bad guy.

1338
01:24:27,375 --> 01:24:30,041
Yes. I get that a lot.

1339
01:24:30,125 --> 01:24:32,833
I have no idea why.

1340
01:24:34,208 --> 01:24:37,125
Oh, thank you Nachtkraab.

1341
01:24:37,208 --> 01:24:39,916
And thank you Ed.

1342
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,583
Thank you Grand Prix of Europe!

1343
01:24:52,875 --> 01:24:55,208
I have no idea
who this mouse is,

1344
01:24:55,291 --> 01:24:58,166
but I'm pretty sure we
will see much more of her.

1345
01:24:59,791 --> 01:25:01,500
In my whole career,

1346
01:25:01,583 --> 01:25:05,166
I have never seen
a Grand Prix like this.

1347
01:25:05,250 --> 01:25:06,291
What about you Peri?

1348
01:25:06,375 --> 01:25:09,166
Oh, my gosh. No. Never!

1349
01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:11,291
I mean, that was,
that was just, I mean,

1350
01:25:11,375 --> 01:25:12,666
that was incredible.

1351
01:25:12,750 --> 01:25:15,041
I mean, oh, Peri,
it was mind blowing.

1352
01:25:15,125 --> 01:25:17,833
I mean, you know,
Enzo, get away with me.

1353
01:25:17,916 --> 01:25:19,500
Okay, come on. Get away with me.

1354
01:25:19,583 --> 01:25:21,625
Oh, I've never felt so alive!

1355
01:25:21,708 --> 01:25:23,791
- And there you have it, folks.
- Come on.

1356
01:25:23,875 --> 01:25:25,875
Peri is a complete loss
for words.

1357
01:25:25,958 --> 01:25:28,041
Get away from me, Enzo!
Come on!

1358
01:25:39,833 --> 01:25:44,541
That prize money
changed everything, Edda.

1359
01:25:44,625 --> 01:25:47,458
Even if you did have
to give half of it to Ed...

1360
01:25:47,541 --> 01:25:48,583
He wouldn't take it.

1361
01:25:48,666 --> 01:25:50,166
Really? Why not?

1362
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:52,041
Well, he said
the only thing he wanted

1363
01:25:52,125 --> 01:25:54,916
was for me
to be part of his racing team.

1364
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,708
You said no?

1365
01:25:56,791 --> 01:25:59,041
Dad, I'm needed here.

1366
01:26:00,250 --> 01:26:02,500
Do you want to be here?

1367
01:26:02,583 --> 01:26:07,041
Of course, I don't wanna be
traveling all over the world

1368
01:26:07,125 --> 01:26:11,875
tag team racing with Ed
winning trophies all the time.

1369
01:26:13,291 --> 01:26:16,458
Oh, okay.
Yeah. Obviously I want that.

1370
01:26:16,541 --> 01:26:19,416
But look how happy
everyone is here.

1371
01:26:19,958 --> 01:26:22,500
This is my family.

1372
01:26:22,583 --> 01:26:25,541
But, you know,
we'll always be here.

1373
01:26:25,625 --> 01:26:27,291
What are you saying?

1374
01:26:27,375 --> 01:26:30,041
I'm saying that if you find
yourself with an opportunity

1375
01:26:30,125 --> 01:26:32,416
to do something
you've always dreamed of,

1376
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:36,583
it's okay to go if you want to.

1377
01:26:36,666 --> 01:26:38,041
It's too late anyway.

1378
01:26:38,125 --> 01:26:41,125
I told him no
and he left for good.

1379
01:26:41,208 --> 01:26:46,416
And I told him to wait for me
to change your mind.

1380
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:49,875
Wait, where?

1381
01:27:08,291 --> 01:27:14,166
So I was thinking we should
call ourselves Team Edda.

1382
01:27:15,833 --> 01:27:19,500
Absolutely not.

1383
01:27:19,583 --> 01:27:22,083
It's just two more letters.

1384
01:27:22,166 --> 01:27:23,458
- Nope.
- Hmm.

1385
01:27:23,541 --> 01:27:28,125
Well how about team Edda
and friend?

1386
01:27:28,208 --> 01:27:29,708
Stop it.

1387
01:27:29,791 --> 01:27:34,291
What about the Ed-dorables?

1388
01:27:34,375 --> 01:27:36,291

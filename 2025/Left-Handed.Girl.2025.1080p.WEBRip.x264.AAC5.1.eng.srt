3
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:05,625
LEFT-HANDED GIRL

4
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:27,333
Oh, look!

5
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:30,833
Can you sit up? So crowded…

6
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:33,083
You make it crowded.

7
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:35,666
- Jeez, how am I--
- You both shut up, okay?

8
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:48,083
It feels like a magical place.

9
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,083
Where are we?

10
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:52,125
Okay, stop yapping.

11
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:11,125
So much traffic!

12
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:13,625
So annoying.

13
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,416
- She's not listening.
- I want to help.

14
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,333
- Take this.
- Go inside, there are a lot of cars.

15
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:28,875
You two go inside.

16
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:30,541
Hurry up.

17
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,000
- No standing here.
- Okay.

18
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,541
Slow down.

19
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:53,041
This is a lot smaller than the photo.

20
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,916
This is so delicious.
Can we eat this every day?

21
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,333
Let me tell you.

22
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,458
Some guy in Japan…

23
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,916
He ate instant noodles
every day for a year.

24
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:20,958
Then he died.

25
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:22,916
Really?

26
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,250
Are you trying to give her nightmares?

27
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,750
And you know what happened in the end?

28
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:28,875
What?

29
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,625
There are so many preservatives
in the noodles,

30
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,708
so his body never decayed.

31
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,500
Nobody realized he had died.

32
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,125
Eat up, I-Jing. You have school tomorrow.

33
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,500
Oh, okay.

34
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,166
Do you still want to eat instant noodles
every day?

35
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,958
It's falling out.

36
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,250
Everyone, we have a new classmate today.

37
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,750
Her name is Cheng I-Jing.

38
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,000
She's five years old.

39
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,416
She's in our senior class.

40
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,291
This is her first day,
so she is a little nervous.

41
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,500
So you have to be good friends to her.

42
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:23,416
Okay.

43
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,750
If she wants to go to the restroom,
what do you do?

44
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,333
Show her the way.

45
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,875
Great. Let's sit down first.

46
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,583
I-Jing, you sit here today.

47
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,333
And you just keep lining them up.

48
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:45,625
When you are done,
ask me to check them, okay?

49
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,291
This one?

50
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,083
Here it is.

51
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,291
This is the stand.

52
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,375
This stand is at the best location.

53
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:57,916
This is it!

54
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:01,500
This stand is at the best location.
Look at the length.

55
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,583
This one is spacious.

56
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,750
You have something smaller and cheaper?

57
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,666
The stainless steel sink,
fridge and freezer.

58
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,000
They are all good to use.

59
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,375
You can start making money
as early as this Friday.

60
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:14,916
If you fail to pay?

61
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,333
Excuse me, you will be shut down.

62
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,041
I'm so bored.

63
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,833
When will we get there?

64
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:25,833
I'm so bored.

65
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,000
When will we get there?

66
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,208
Are we there yet?

67
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,083
We arrived. This is it.

68
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:56,333
When you see grandparents,
remember to say hi. You heard me?

69
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,416
Oh, okay.

70
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,583
Do you remember Grandma?

71
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:06,375
You were this small when I visited.

72
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,208
You don't remember me?

73
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,125
It's okay, no problem.

74
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,666
So cute.

75
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:18,333
I-Ann.

76
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:21,166
Your shirt and shorts are way too short.

77
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,958
There are lots of perverts and psychos
out there.

78
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,375
It's dangerous to dress like that.

79
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,250
No worries, I wear these every day.

80
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,250
I told her many times.
She wouldn't listen.

81
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:30,500
And look at you…

82
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,583
You're looking haggard, you know?

83
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,875
Are you getting enough sleep?

84
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:39,541
We just paid the deposit.
We can start on Monday.

85
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,750
Why can't we run a fruit stand?

86
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,250
Isn't it easier to wash the fruits
and display them for sale?

87
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,958
Do you know that fruits are easily rotten?

88
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:55,333
You have to spend twice the money and time
to prepare the food for the noodle stand.

89
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,750
Is it truly a better deal?

90
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,041
If you make money, you can have opinions.

91
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,500
Okay. I will go make money myself.

92
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:05,958
I'll make more than you do.

93
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:07,958
Please, please.

94
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,541
No fighting while eating, okay?

95
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,833
She thinks she knows it all.
She didn’t even graduate high school.

96
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:16,833
Seriously.

97
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,958
Is that my fault?

98
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,666
This is our first family dinner.
Watch your attitude.

99
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,833
Aren't you the problem?

100
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,041
Wait a second.

101
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,666
Why is she eating with her left hand?

102
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,833
Don't worry about it, okay?

103
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,750
Give me a break and eat your dinner.
So annoying.

104
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,333
How come you didn’t buckle up the helmet?

105
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,625
Sister, look. What is that?

106
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,625
Sis, I got a prize at school today.

107
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:18,916
What are you doing?

108
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,500
Wait until we get home, not now!

109
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,208
I am telling Mom you ran the red light!

110
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,375
If you get there fast,

111
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,458
I won't call you out for farting.

112
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,833
We're almost there.

113
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,083
Whether it's water spilling,

114
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,875
or any other liquid,

115
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:47,333
let me tell you, its absorption is super.

116
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:48,958
You really don't want to try?

117
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:51,041
Uncle, you can use it as a diaper.

118
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:54,083
Inflation is out of control right now.
Only your salary didn't increase.

119
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,625
Hi, Johnny!

120
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:56,916
Hi.

121
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,208
Let me introduce my loyal customer.

122
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,125
Come, I-Jing, let me pick you up.

123
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,208
Oh, getting heavy!

124
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,833
Did you eat too much?

125
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:09,708
Come tell everyone
how useful this Magic Sponge is.

126
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,041
It is very useful!

127
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,583
How useful?

128
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:15,458
It is the best sponge in the world.

129
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,250
You'll regret not buying it.

130
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,250
Did you hear that?

131
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,125
You'll regret not buying it.

132
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,333
Thanks to my special guest.

133
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:25,000
Hurry back to Mommy.

134
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,041
Special price today!
Buy one, get one free.

135
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,333
Mom.

136
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,625
- Did your sister pick you up on time?
- No, but she told me to say that she did.

137
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:45,750
Three.

138
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,125
But I still think
you need to dress a little sexier.

139
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:52,250
But I thought
what I wear is very revealing.

140
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,625
Six.

141
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,250
Revealing doesn't mean sexy.

142
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:58,083
The idea is to create a sexual fantasy
for the customer.

143
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:00,833
Seven.

144
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:02,833
Five.

145
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,875
Queen.

146
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,500
Wait, let me introduce.

147
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:11,666
Hello.

148
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,708
I-Ann, this is Xiao-Ping.

149
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,708
Xiao-Ping, this is I-Ann.

150
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,833
- Who is this?
- I told you. Her name's Xiao-Ping.

151
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,583
Hello. I'm Xiao-Ping.

152
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,833
Why is she here?

153
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,041
I told you I'm hiring a new girl.

154
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,916
That girl Xiao-Mei with her stone face.
Ruined my business.

155
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,958
So I called her and fired her.

156
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,666
Not my business.

157
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,500
This is your business.
I need you to show her the ropes.

158
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,750
Mom, is this the last dish?

159
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,041
Do you need other help?

160
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,208
No, no more.

161
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:45,125
Okay.

162
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,458
- Go do your homework.
- Okay.

163
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,208
This is betel nut. Betel flower. Red lime.

164
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,666
Get some red lime.

165
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,833
Put it in the center of the betel nut.

166
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:04,708
Add a betel flower.

167
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:05,708
This one is done.

168
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,750
- Hi, boss!
- I-Jing is here!

169
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:19,458
Our champion I-Jing is here!

170
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,291
Ten in a box.
You have to make 300 at once.

171
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,000
Put them in the fridge immediately
to keep fresh. Got it?

172
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,875
You're so skilled.
How long have you been doing this?

173
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,208
Don't be too mean. Be nice.

174
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,625
Don't scare her.

175
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,291
I am very nice.

176
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,416
I explain things very clearly, okay?

177
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,166
$2,000 increase is way too much.

178
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,583
- Mom, look!
- $2,000 increase…

179
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,166
Uncle Ding is out of cigarettes.

180
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,125
Go get two packs of Long Life for him.

181
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,333
Good girl. Thank you.

182
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,916
We also increased the prices.
What else is there to do?

183
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,666
What do you want?

184
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,708
One hundred?

185
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,875
Take a cup for me.

186
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,583
Here is your spit cup.

187
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:29,708
- What time are you off work?
- Huh, what?

188
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:32,541
- What's the matter?
- Want to ask you out to sing.

189
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:36,125
No, I am busy after work.
I have to teach the new girl.

190
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,708
How about when I am done?
Then we'll go singing together.

191
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:41,125
- Did you wrap this one?
- Yes. Isn't it good?

192
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,583
- Super sweet.
- Thank you.

193
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:45,333
- I will pick you up after work.
- You are such a smooth talker. Bye.

194
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:46,416
Bye-bye.

195
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,541
- Greenies, two hundred.
- Greenies are in the boxes.

196
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:54,875
Get four boxes.

197
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,375
Give them to the customer.

198
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,875
Here. Thank you. Bye-bye.

199
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,833
Count the money,
then put them in this box.

200
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,375
Got it?

201
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,166
How was it?

202
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,333
Nervous? Feeling scared?

203
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,958
Hey, boss lady.

204
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:22,291
Your employee is sleeping on the job.

205
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,125
You have to dock her pay.

206
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,041
This is for you.

207
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,666
Magic Sponge.

208
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,166
No, thanks.
You save them for your customers.

209
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,625
Don't be so polite with me.

210
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,875
I have a lot in stock.

211
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:39,916
Take it.

212
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,666
So…

213
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,083
How is the business these days?

214
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:48,791
Mediocre.

215
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:50,750
How about this?

216
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,333
This is a free gift for you.

217
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:56,333
Help me with promotion next time.

218
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:57,708
Okay?

219
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,916
It's a deal.

220
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,208
Ali, you close up.

221
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,291
- Okay, bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

222
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:16,541
You going back?

223
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,125
- Say goodbye to uncle.
- Goodnight.

224
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,916
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

225
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:25,666
Mom, can I have a dog?

226
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,708
Huh?

227
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,666
Can I have a dog?

228
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,166
Have a dog?

229
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,083
No way.

230
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,916
Dogs are dirty.

231
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,750
Your mum is dog-tired every day.
You should take care of me.

232
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:39,291
Stop looking.

233
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,208
Hello?

234
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,666
Yes, this is she.

235
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,416
Did you take my cell phone again?

236
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,125
Don't even ask?

237
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:02,833
I got a call this morning.

238
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,416
And?

239
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,541
Your father is in the hospital.

240
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:13,791
So?

241
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,791
So I’m going to the hospital to see him.
You are coming with me.

242
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,125
How is that my business?

243
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,750
I don't want to argue with you.

244
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,125
Okay. I am not arguing.
I am just not going.

245
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:31,666
I am telling you to go, so you will go!

246
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,958
What about you, after what he did to you?

247
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:40,541
After all the shit he put you through.

248
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,083
Why are you going to see him?

249
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,583
Not going to answer?

250
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,458
What an idiot.

251
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:01,625
What did you say?

252
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,458
Nothing.

253
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,208
Who's in the hospital?

254
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,916
Thanks.

255
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:25,166
Here.

256
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,625
- Thanks.
- No problem.

257
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,541
You can't talk now?

258
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,125
Didn't I tell you not to smoke so much?

259
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,791
Here you go.

260
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,333
- Boss, why are you so late today?
- I am waiting for you to get off work.

261
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,250
Waiting for me to get off work?
You're so sweet.

262
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:39,166
There is still a long time to go.
Okay, ride safely. Bye.

263
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,916
Do you have two for 200 special?

264
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,625
You're too much. You said you were going
to be late, but an hour and a half hours?

265
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,125
- What the hell?
- Something to take care of at home.

266
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,750
You got things going on at home every day.
Thank God for Xiao-Ping.

267
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,500
- She worked two extra hours.
- They're jumbo.

268
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:55,791
- Why don’t you give her more hours then?
- All you know how to do is talk back?

269
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:00,125
What?

270
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,083
2 for 200.

271
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,291
You idiot, you can't do that.

272
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:05,750
What if he were a cop?

273
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:07,541
What's wrong now?

274
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,916
She is acting like an idiot.

275
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,250
More money, more problems.

276
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:30,333
I-Ann. Go pick up I-Jing at school today.

277
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,500
Then help Ali open the stand.

278
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,250
Why me?

279
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:40,666
How much time are you spending
at the hospital?

280
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,666
He has very little time left. He's dying.

281
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,541
He deserves it.
It has nothing to do with you.

282
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:52,166
If you were in the hospital today,
he would just abandon you.

283
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:58,166
Okay. If you must go,

284
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,875
you better find out exactly
how much he made these ten plus years.

285
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:04,875
Even if he just made one dime,

286
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,375
it belongs to us.

287
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,291
You get it?

288
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,708
Are you done?

289
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:10,958
Not yet.

290
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,166
Are you done?

291
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,125
Not yet.

292
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,375
Who made a dime?

293
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:16,791
Shush. None of your business.

294
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,291
Didn't Mom tell you,
never interrupt when adults are talking?

295
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,083
Got it?

296
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:28,750
Grandpa loves me.

297
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:31,083
Always loves me.

298
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,208
The class is over. Let's go have snacks.

299
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:36,125
Okay.

300
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:45,083
How come you didn't buckle up?

301
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:52,041
I want an extra-large bubble milk tea.

302
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,416
So I have energy to work.

303
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,125
Let me try. Let me show you. Look!

304
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:58,750
That's gross.

305
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,125
Come on, one, two.

306
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:02,250
- Come on.
- Two balls only.

307
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:04,000
Let's compete. Hurry up.

308
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:06,166
- Hurry up.
- Wait for me.

309
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,958
Hurry up.

310
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:09,666
- You don't wait for me.
- You saw that?

311
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,333
- I-Ann.
- No wonder you don't have friends.

312
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:12,500
You got customers.

313
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,541
- Their noodle is delicious.
- Okay.

314
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,333
I am the champion.

315
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:17,708
Wonton soup.

316
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:20,916
One dried noodle, one wonton soup,
and one blanched veggies.

317
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,958
Eat here.

318
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,250
One dried noodle--

319
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,833
Dried noodle, wonton soup,
blanched veggies.

320
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:27,291
Thanks.

321
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:29,791
Wait a moment.
The food will be ready right away.

322
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:35,625
I-Ann. How come
you haven’t come here for so long?

323
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,875
I am working at a betel nut stand now.

324
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,916
Put it here?

325
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,166
Yes, right here.

326
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,666
Oh. You work at the betel nut stand.
Your mom is okay with that?

327
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,125
I don't care about her.
Anyway, I’ll end up earning more than her.

328
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:52,333
You don't know how to cook, stop it.

329
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,500
- Okay, you do it, whatever.
- You get out.

330
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,000
What a mess.

331
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:59,833
Come check it out. Multifunction brush.
There are four types of brushes.

332
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:02,208
You can brush the glass,
the toilet, the tiles, the cracks.

333
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:04,250
Solve all the problems
with just one bottle.

334
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:05,541
Hey, hey, hey.

335
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:06,875
You cheated again.

336
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:08,541
"You cheated again."

337
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:10,541
You cheated again. One more time.

338
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:14,583
Hurry up.

339
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:17,750
I haven’t finished the hey, hey, hey part.
You cheated.

340
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:20,375
Okay, play on your own.
Do your drawings. Be good.

341
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:23,708
- Are you leaving?
- I am leaving.

342
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:25,375
Bye-bye.

343
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:27,750
What is this?

344
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:30,625
Hey, who did this?

345
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:34,375
I saw some kids
spitting the tapioca balls earlier.

346
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:36,416
Today's youth… Unbelievable.

347
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,708
This has gone too far!

348
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:41,041
I have a brush. Let me help you clean.

349
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,000
Pissing me off.

350
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:45,958
Don't I have enough work to do?

351
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:53,041
Let me help. Let me help.
Let me tell you, this tool is amazing.

352
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:54,916
I have four types of brushes.

353
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,916
You can brush glass, brush the toilet…

354
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:07,041
Go sit over there first.

355
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:13,250
Wait here. Got it?

356
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:39,750
Can't speak?

357
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,541
That's great.

358
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,333
No apologies or explanations.

359
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:56,166
Save the trouble.

360
00:24:58,208 --> 00:25:00,083
I'm not here to converse with you.

361
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:04,666
I just want to say one thing.

362
00:25:08,583 --> 00:25:10,583
I told you I am not going to read it.

363
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:15,750
Sis, I want to use the restroom.

364
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:31,583
Are you surprised?

365
00:25:32,791 --> 00:25:35,000
Do you think Mom
would foolishly wait for you?

366
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:39,375
She had already met another man
in Taichung.

367
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:43,500
Next time my mother comes in here,

368
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,666
I want you to tell her
not to come visit you again.

369
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:49,041
You heard me?

370
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:53,791
You heard me?

371
00:25:54,916 --> 00:25:57,000
Sis, who's he?

372
00:25:57,708 --> 00:25:59,291
Who's he?

373
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,750
Who's he?

374
00:26:01,833 --> 00:26:03,833
You are so annoying!

375
00:26:03,916 --> 00:26:05,958
Why are you being aggressive?

376
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:07,750
If you dare tell Mom we came here,

377
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:09,125
you will be fucked.

378
00:26:09,208 --> 00:26:11,166
I will throw out all your crayons.
You heard me?

379
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,875
What are you crying about? Answer me!

380
00:26:18,416 --> 00:26:19,541
Okay.

381
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:12,000
This Friday and Saturday,
I have to go to Yilan for some errands.

382
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,250
Go help Ali open the stand earlier.

383
00:27:19,541 --> 00:27:21,583
Then take I-Jing to Grandma's.
Let her stay overnight.

384
00:27:21,666 --> 00:27:23,041
What errands?

385
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,375
He's dying,
what can you be helping him with?

386
00:27:27,791 --> 00:27:29,916
Why are you so opinionated?

387
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,250
You already paid for his debt
more than ten years.

388
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:33,833
What else do you owe him?

389
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:35,833
What else do you owe him?

390
00:27:35,916 --> 00:27:37,541
He is dead.

391
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:41,458
Once I take care of his funeral,
I’ll be done paying. Are you happy now?

392
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:52,375
The noodle is ready.
Bring it to the customer for me.

393
00:27:52,458 --> 00:27:54,625
All right, I am working, okay?

394
00:27:58,375 --> 00:28:00,291
Here are your noodles.

395
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:02,541
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

396
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:04,500
There is a customer, take the order.

397
00:28:05,291 --> 00:28:08,333
I want dried noodles, small.
And blanched veggies.

398
00:28:08,416 --> 00:28:12,666
- Dried noodles--
- Help me wash the dirty dishes.

399
00:28:13,541 --> 00:28:16,458
Small meat meatball soup.

400
00:28:16,541 --> 00:28:17,375
Okay.

401
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,458
It will be ready soon.

402
00:28:25,541 --> 00:28:26,791
Okay. Thanks.

403
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:30,541
Squid ball!

404
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:33,333
- Okay, I will have roasted corn.
- Okay.

405
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:36,125
Cheng I-Ann?

406
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:41,208
It's me, Xie Mu-Xi.

407
00:28:41,958 --> 00:28:43,375
Long time no see.

408
00:28:43,458 --> 00:28:45,000
You look different.

409
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,583
Xie Mu-Xi?

410
00:28:46,666 --> 00:28:48,791
We were in the same class
in Taipei High School.

411
00:28:48,875 --> 00:28:51,666
I changed my name. It was Xie Xin-Yi.
My mom took me to a fortune-teller.

412
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:54,458
He suggested changing my name
to get a better shot on the college exam.

413
00:28:54,541 --> 00:28:55,375
For real?

414
00:28:56,583 --> 00:28:58,750
More than half of our classmates
changed their names.

415
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,125
For real?

416
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:02,333
I had no idea.

417
00:29:02,416 --> 00:29:04,541
I didn't know you were in Taipei.

418
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:07,833
Yeah, I moved back here recently.

419
00:29:07,916 --> 00:29:09,208
Which university do you go to?

420
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:10,916
I am not in university.

421
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,250
Do you work here?

422
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:17,041
No, this is my mom's noodle stand.
I come here to help once in a while.

423
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,125
We are throwing a motel party next week.

424
00:29:20,208 --> 00:29:23,000
Pin-Rui is super impressive.
He booked the biggest suite.

425
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:25,916
Please come. We haven’t seen each other
for so long. It will be fun!

426
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,583
Motel party?

427
00:29:29,416 --> 00:29:30,958
Hurry, get off.

428
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:33,666
I don't want to go to Grandma's place.

429
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,208
Grandpa never takes showers.

430
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:38,708
He smells like stinky tofu!

431
00:29:38,791 --> 00:29:41,708
You are the stinky one.
Stop complaining. Go inside.

432
00:29:41,791 --> 00:29:43,458
Listen to Grandpa and Grandma.

433
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:45,500
Okay.

434
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:55,000
Eating with her left hand?

435
00:29:55,958 --> 00:29:57,958
Shu-Fen doesn't know how to raise a kid?

436
00:29:59,416 --> 00:30:00,750
Give me a break.

437
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:02,125
Times have changed.

438
00:30:02,208 --> 00:30:05,041
- Nobody cares about this anymore.
- It makes me angry to see that!

439
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:06,291
If it were in the old days…

440
00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:08,958
If you insist on using your left hand,
you'll be hung up and beaten.

441
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:12,958
- You have a U.S. visa?
- Yes.

442
00:30:13,041 --> 00:30:14,000
Let me see.

443
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:19,875
What are you looking at?

444
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:22,291
Children should listen and not talk.

445
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:25,333
Be good, watch them dance.

446
00:30:25,416 --> 00:30:27,916
They are bad.

447
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:29,583
Be good.

448
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:31,708
She’s arriving tomorrow night.

449
00:30:31,791 --> 00:30:35,583
Your flight is early Sunday morning.
She’ll have to sleep over at your place.

450
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:37,666
- Is that okay?
- Okay, no problem.

451
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,125
You need to be careful
when passing the customs.

452
00:30:41,625 --> 00:30:44,250
Don't touch this.
This is worth a lot of money.

453
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:48,458
Fuck. This is why I don't want kids.

454
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,166
<i>A student in Taichung changed her name</i>
<i>to Guo, Salmon-Don</i>

455
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,416
<i>on the morning of the 17th.</i>

456
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,125
<i>We asked her why changing her name</i>
<i>to Salmon-Don.</i>

457
00:31:21,208 --> 00:31:23,958
<i>And she told my colleague directly.</i>

458
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:28,041
<i>She is following a promotion</i>
<i>ed by a business.</i>

459
00:31:28,125 --> 00:31:32,083
<i>A known sushi restaurant started</i>
<i>a “looking for the salmon” promotion.</i>

460
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:33,541
Don't use left hand in my house.

461
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,291
<i>If your name contains “salmon,”</i>

462
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:39,416
<i>you can invite five of your friends.</i>
<i>Enjoy all-you-can-eat sushi for free.</i>

463
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,750
<i>- Will you change your name?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

464
00:31:40,833 --> 00:31:41,666
<i>Why not?</i>

465
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:44,250
<i>It just doesn’t make sense to change</i>
<i>my name based on a free meal.</i>

466
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:46,583
<i>I'll have to keep changing my name</i>
<i>for the rest of my life.</i>

467
00:31:48,291 --> 00:31:50,250
Can you hurry up?

468
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:52,958
Wait, why the rush?

469
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:54,791
I have to go open the noodle stand
for my mom.

470
00:31:54,875 --> 00:31:56,750
Why didn't you tell me?

471
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,875
I told you I need to take today off.

472
00:32:00,375 --> 00:32:02,666
Can we not talk about this now?

473
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:09,583
- Auntie.
- Hi, Qing-Long.

474
00:32:09,666 --> 00:32:11,000
Please come in.

475
00:32:11,583 --> 00:32:13,583
Come in quickly.

476
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:14,875
Why so nervous?

477
00:32:14,958 --> 00:32:19,041
You don’t understand.
We have a nosy neighbor.

478
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:22,750
- She's all yours.
- I will take care of her, no worries.

479
00:32:22,833 --> 00:32:24,500
Smoking again?

480
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:26,333
Go clean up!

481
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:30,541
Okay, I will leave, okay?

482
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:38,708
I-Ann.

483
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:41,583
Your maid Mary doesn't seem to like you.

484
00:32:42,625 --> 00:32:45,291
I have a name. My name is Ali.

485
00:32:45,791 --> 00:32:47,666
Ali you good!

486
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,041
Ali good!

487
00:32:49,958 --> 00:32:51,125
Goodbye, goodbye.

488
00:32:55,583 --> 00:32:57,291
This way, have a seat.

489
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:58,666
Have a seat.

490
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:03,500
The magical toothpaste squeezing tool!
This thing is amazing.

491
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:07,125
With this tool, you use up all toothpaste.
Not a drop left.

492
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:09,250
- Give it a try.
- Does this really work?

493
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:11,958
It's great for I-Jing.
Kids are bad at squeezing the tube.

494
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:14,250
With this tool,
it will be squeezed completely clean.

495
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:16,291
She doesn't brush her teeth anyway.
No need.

496
00:33:16,375 --> 00:33:18,958
Did you eat?

497
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:21,875
- I ate already. Thank you.
- I see.

498
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,791
Why do you speak funny?

499
00:33:25,416 --> 00:33:26,291
Be polite!

500
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:28,166
Kids don't know any better.

501
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:30,250
Where's your mother? Why isn't she here?

502
00:33:32,541 --> 00:33:34,125
Are you interested in my mom?

503
00:33:35,291 --> 00:33:36,416
I…

504
00:33:39,916 --> 00:33:42,458
Come, let me help.

505
00:33:42,958 --> 00:33:44,333
Wen-Bing, you get in first.

506
00:33:44,416 --> 00:33:45,458
I-Jing.

507
00:33:46,583 --> 00:33:49,291
I was helping!

508
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:52,875
Oh, right! There are four bags of food
in the refrigerator,

509
00:33:52,958 --> 00:33:54,833
and another four bags in the freezer.

510
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:56,083
You got it?

511
00:33:56,166 --> 00:33:58,333
I will be back next Tuesday. Goodbye.

512
00:33:58,416 --> 00:33:59,458
Bye.

513
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,000
Hey!

514
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:08,875
Your grandmother or your mother…
I don’t care what others say.

515
00:34:08,958 --> 00:34:10,083
But not on my watch.

516
00:34:10,166 --> 00:34:11,958
You can’t use your left hand anymore,
got it?

517
00:34:12,041 --> 00:34:12,875
Why?

518
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:15,166
Why? Left hand is evil.

519
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:17,333
It belongs to the devil.

520
00:34:17,416 --> 00:34:20,500
If you use left hand you are doing
the devil's work. You got it?

521
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:23,000
Okay.

522
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,416
Are you serious?

523
00:34:41,416 --> 00:34:43,625
It’s so cute. It's the only thing
your father left behind.

524
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:46,041
A meerkat?

525
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,000
Not sure where he got one.

526
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:49,875
Just kept it as a pet.

527
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:52,916
What's its name?

528
00:34:53,416 --> 00:34:54,666
I don't know.

529
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,708
GooGoo…

530
00:34:56,791 --> 00:34:58,625
Call it GooGoo!

531
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,750
23, 24, 25.

532
00:35:03,708 --> 00:35:05,916
It's right. Thank you.

533
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,250
So easy, right?

534
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,958
Not only easy, but very convenient.

535
00:35:11,958 --> 00:35:15,166
They have cheaper vitamins over there!

536
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,500
Really?

537
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:17,875
By the way.

538
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:21,208
Lee wants to know if you want to go again
on the 15th of next month?

539
00:35:21,791 --> 00:35:23,333
That day is my birthday.

540
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:25,083
Well, this…

541
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:29,083
My son is coming back to Taiwan,
and throwing me a birthday party.

542
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:32,041
Okay, we will let you know.

543
00:35:33,041 --> 00:35:34,916
Hey.

544
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,916
Can you tell how old I am?

545
00:35:39,666 --> 00:35:40,916
Sixty-five?

546
00:35:42,791 --> 00:35:44,000
I'm not that old.

547
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:45,791
I'm not even 60 yet.

548
00:35:57,708 --> 00:35:59,625
Boss, how much is this?

549
00:35:59,708 --> 00:36:00,916
Sixty bucks.

550
00:36:34,958 --> 00:36:36,083
What are you doing?

551
00:36:36,166 --> 00:36:37,416
Nothing.

552
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:44,833
GooGoo, look!

553
00:36:44,916 --> 00:36:47,458
The Devil Hand got it for me.

554
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:48,750
Is it pretty?

555
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:50,958
GooGoo, your ball is over there.

556
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:53,833
GooGoo.

557
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,500
Get it out of here, take it away!

558
00:37:01,416 --> 00:37:03,666
You look different today.

559
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:05,333
Do I look pretty?

560
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:06,666
Pretty!

561
00:37:10,416 --> 00:37:13,000
This can clean the glass, let me show you.

562
00:37:13,958 --> 00:37:17,125
You can spray inside, spray the top,
spray the bottom, spray outside.

563
00:37:17,208 --> 00:37:18,958
After you spray it down.

564
00:37:19,041 --> 00:37:21,083
Johnny, the battery charger
you gave me was lousy.

565
00:37:21,166 --> 00:37:23,208
Bring me a more powerful one
next time, okay?

566
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:25,958
I will give you something that
would last for a month, okay?

567
00:37:26,041 --> 00:37:27,541
Now you are talking.

568
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:30,000
Look, once you wipe, right?

569
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:32,250
It’s spotless, right?

570
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,458
Ali.

571
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:36,000
- Cook the noodle for me.
- Okay.

572
00:37:36,083 --> 00:37:39,416
Brother Yang, excuse me. Let's go sit
at the back, okay? I'll buy you a drink.

573
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:03,041
I have some unexpected expenses
this month.

574
00:38:03,125 --> 00:38:05,000
I’ll make sure to pay on time next month!

575
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:06,833
- I'm sorry.
- Next month?

576
00:38:06,916 --> 00:38:09,291
I didn't receive it last month either.

577
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:10,208
Do you know?

578
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:11,500
You should know.

579
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:15,750
Our night market is the busiest
and most vibrant in all of Taipei.

580
00:38:15,833 --> 00:38:16,666
Yes--

581
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:19,875
If you keep paying rent late,
then I'll let others take over.

582
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,416
I'm really sorry.

583
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,583
I won't do this next month.

584
00:38:32,166 --> 00:38:35,375
Don't get it wrong. I have to make
so many trips just to collect the rent.

585
00:38:35,458 --> 00:38:36,625
What's up with that?

586
00:38:36,708 --> 00:38:38,541
- I am sorry.
- Yang!

587
00:38:38,625 --> 00:38:40,208
Why so angry? Have a drink.

588
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:42,750
People are lined up waiting to take over.

589
00:38:42,833 --> 00:38:44,750
You have to pay rent
to keep your business.

590
00:38:44,833 --> 00:38:47,291
Weren’t you looking for the watch that
takes the blood pressure?

591
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:49,000
I got some in stock. Wanna see it?

592
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:51,833
- I am really sorry.
- You have it?

593
00:38:51,916 --> 00:38:53,916
Yes. I just had a new shipment today.

594
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,666
Sir, your noodles.

595
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:11,208
When you are in a bad mood,
you need to have some drinks. Come on.

596
00:39:16,583 --> 00:39:17,625
Perfect.

597
00:39:19,833 --> 00:39:22,208
- Ali!
- You are back.

598
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:24,166
- Mom.
- I-Jing!

599
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:26,625
Where did you go? Having that much fun?

600
00:39:30,666 --> 00:39:34,333
I have a rotating savings plan.
And it matures this month.

601
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:37,083
I don't need that money.

602
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:40,250
I am thinking…
Do you want to borrow it first?

603
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:49,791
No need.

604
00:39:49,875 --> 00:39:51,750
You keep the money.

605
00:39:55,666 --> 00:39:57,041
I'll figure it out.

606
00:40:00,375 --> 00:40:02,208
I'm going to close up first.

607
00:40:05,708 --> 00:40:06,750
Hey.

608
00:40:07,375 --> 00:40:09,375
Wait for me when you're done.

609
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:11,708
We can drink more.

610
00:40:12,541 --> 00:40:14,583
Okay, no problem!

611
00:40:54,916 --> 00:40:57,083
Cheng I-Ann! You are here!

612
00:40:57,166 --> 00:40:58,875
I was looking for you.

613
00:40:58,958 --> 00:41:00,833
You look so pretty today.

614
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:03,000
I just threw on whatever. You too.

615
00:41:03,083 --> 00:41:05,166
Thank you. Wanna come in and get a drink?

616
00:41:05,958 --> 00:41:07,791
It is so cute. Its name is GooGoo?

617
00:41:07,875 --> 00:41:08,958
Yes.

618
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:10,125
Does it bite?

619
00:41:10,208 --> 00:41:11,166
No.

620
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:13,375
GooGoo.

621
00:41:19,375 --> 00:41:22,750
First time visiting, I have to bring you
a gift. I brought some liquor.

622
00:41:24,166 --> 00:41:26,083
Okay, let's drink yours.

623
00:41:27,166 --> 00:41:29,083
I-Jing, time for bed. It's late.

624
00:41:29,166 --> 00:41:31,333
No more playing with GooGoo. Go to bed.

625
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:33,416
Bye, GooGoo.

626
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,625
Good night.

627
00:41:34,708 --> 00:41:36,958
Good night.

628
00:41:43,625 --> 00:41:45,875
- That's embarrassing.
- What are they doing?

629
00:41:47,083 --> 00:41:49,083
Do you like college life?

630
00:41:49,166 --> 00:41:50,625
Love it!

631
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:55,291
How come you're not in university?

632
00:41:56,291 --> 00:41:57,625
My family can't afford it.

633
00:41:58,208 --> 00:42:00,291
I thought you would go
to a national university.

634
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:03,833
You were a straight A student.
Also, the campus belle.

635
00:42:04,333 --> 00:42:06,041
Everyone was super jealous of you.

636
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:08,875
Campus belle is an embarrassing title.

637
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,833
I-Jing, did you brush your teeth?

638
00:42:26,916 --> 00:42:28,000
Not yet.

639
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:31,333
I never thought I'd see you again.

640
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:33,125
You just disappeared one day.

641
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:38,458
We moved after my father ran away.

642
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,291
I thought your father left
long before that.

643
00:42:42,375 --> 00:42:44,291
Yeah! Let's open the champagne!

644
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:46,750
One, two, three, yeah!

645
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,083
Thank you.

646
00:43:00,041 --> 00:43:01,416
Where is the cap?

647
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:05,375
It's okay.
We are going to finish it anyway.

648
00:43:10,666 --> 00:43:14,000
Smile more. You usually seem a bit gloomy.

649
00:43:14,083 --> 00:43:15,916
You seem distracted at work.

650
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,500
I think when you smile

651
00:43:18,166 --> 00:43:19,375
you look really nice.

652
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:26,416
What is it?

653
00:43:28,583 --> 00:43:29,583
Drink. What's wrong?

654
00:43:29,666 --> 00:43:31,875
Nothing.

655
00:43:32,916 --> 00:43:34,208
Not drunk.

656
00:43:36,291 --> 00:43:37,958
Okay, just a little.

657
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,791
So how much?

658
00:43:51,166 --> 00:43:52,416
What are you talking about?

659
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,708
Two for 200. 100 for a thigh touch.

660
00:43:57,125 --> 00:43:58,375
Two for 200.

661
00:44:00,458 --> 00:44:02,625
I work hard.
You have no right to criticize others!

662
00:44:02,708 --> 00:44:03,625
Why so nasty?

663
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:05,916
You college kids think you're hot shit?

664
00:44:06,416 --> 00:44:07,333
Buzzkiller.

665
00:44:08,583 --> 00:44:09,708
Cheng I-Ann!

666
00:44:10,625 --> 00:44:11,833
What's up with her?

667
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:13,791
What’s the situation?

668
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:24,166
Are we…

669
00:44:24,916 --> 00:44:26,333
moving too fast?

670
00:44:29,666 --> 00:44:31,958
Why is it so hard to open?

671
00:44:33,541 --> 00:44:34,666
Let me help you.

672
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:43,958
Ready.

673
00:44:47,541 --> 00:44:48,500
Shu-Fen?

674
00:44:56,708 --> 00:44:58,500
Your mom fell asleep.

675
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,583
Why aren't you leaving?

676
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:07,375
I am leaving.

677
00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:09,041
Get the fuck out!

678
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:11,416
Good night.

679
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:14,166
Do you have ID?

680
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:18,958
Leave your contact info here.

681
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,250
Hey!

682
00:46:53,333 --> 00:46:54,250
What?

683
00:46:55,375 --> 00:46:56,333
Nothing.

684
00:46:56,416 --> 00:46:58,291
Are you kidding me? You're looking at her?

685
00:46:58,375 --> 00:47:00,083
Quiet down. That’s not true.

686
00:47:00,625 --> 00:47:03,625
- Go ahead if you want to fuck her.
- No. Come back first!

687
00:47:04,333 --> 00:47:06,041
- He is yours.
- What?

688
00:47:06,625 --> 00:47:07,916
Freebies next time!

689
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,625
Okay, thanks. See you. Bye-bye.

690
00:47:13,458 --> 00:47:16,916
- What are you looking at? Go inside!
- Nothing, we were just organizing things.

691
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,750
Had a little quarrel.

692
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,625
Come out.

693
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:25,333
All right.

694
00:47:29,125 --> 00:47:30,750
Here you go. Go.

695
00:47:33,208 --> 00:47:35,375
Play ball with me?

696
00:47:35,458 --> 00:47:37,000
You like it.

697
00:47:37,083 --> 00:47:38,458
Let me have it.

698
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,416
I-Jing, let's go. We are going to have
a tea afternoon with aunties and Grandma.

699
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:47,125
But I want to bring GooGoo…

700
00:47:47,208 --> 00:47:48,791
Absolutely not!

701
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,083
Here, I brought gifts for everyone.

702
00:48:06,666 --> 00:48:08,666
- Everyone has one. One bag per person.
- Mom, thanks.

703
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:09,958
This is yours.

704
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,625
- Here, this is yours.
- This is great!

705
00:48:17,625 --> 00:48:19,375
There is no fish oil?

706
00:48:19,958 --> 00:48:21,958
So we got t-shirts?

707
00:48:22,041 --> 00:48:25,291
These vitamins are the best!

708
00:48:25,375 --> 00:48:28,708
Besides, it has the highest potency!
They are very expensive.

709
00:48:28,791 --> 00:48:30,916
How often do you travel to America?

710
00:48:31,416 --> 00:48:34,375
No. I go about twice a month.

711
00:48:34,458 --> 00:48:37,000
Twice? Twice is a lot.

712
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:41,000
No big deal. Let me go to the restroom.

713
00:48:42,375 --> 00:48:44,916
Look at her, dodging the topic again.

714
00:48:45,916 --> 00:48:49,291
It's almost Mom’s birthday.
Where to hold the party this year?

715
00:48:50,041 --> 00:48:51,208
Tong-Qing restaurant.

716
00:48:51,291 --> 00:48:52,125
Where else?

717
00:48:52,208 --> 00:48:54,750
- How much is it per table?
- Let me clarify first.

718
00:48:54,833 --> 00:48:57,833
- I have no money to share the bills.
- What's your problem again?

719
00:48:59,625 --> 00:49:03,208
Will our brother share the bill with us?
It is not a lot of money.

720
00:49:06,708 --> 00:49:10,916
Cheng Jiang-Qing's medical bills
and funeral cost me 150K NKD.

721
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:14,833
He died? When?

722
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:18,458
What? Does he have no family anymore?

723
00:49:18,541 --> 00:49:20,875
It's not your responsibility
to pay for the funeral.

724
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,666
- Who is he to you?
- I'm his only family.

725
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:25,166
- Wow.
- How come?

726
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:28,208
- You need to get your head straight.
- Miss, this is not a small amount.

727
00:49:28,291 --> 00:49:29,958
Are you rich now?

728
00:49:30,041 --> 00:49:32,208
Even if I'm not rich, I still had to pay.

729
00:49:33,375 --> 00:49:37,000
- Can you stop making sarcastic comments?
- Are you running a charity?

730
00:49:37,083 --> 00:49:38,458
He helped you get a job.

731
00:49:38,541 --> 00:49:40,166
He lent money to your husband when needed.

732
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:42,125
Don’t bring up what happened
a million years ago.

733
00:49:42,208 --> 00:49:44,666
- I paid it back, okay?
- These are two separate matters.

734
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:48,375
Like I said, if I didn't pay for him,
no one would pay.

735
00:49:48,458 --> 00:49:49,958
It's not about you pay it back or not.

736
00:49:50,041 --> 00:49:52,541
- He helped you.
- These are two separate matters.

737
00:49:52,625 --> 00:49:54,166
- She paid the money back.
- I worked hard.

738
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:57,958
He passed away. I paid for his funeral.
Not on just… not for luxury spending.

739
00:49:58,041 --> 00:49:59,666
Shouldn't you assess your situation first?

740
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:02,375
- It's for his funeral.
- You never discuss with us.

741
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:04,458
- I don't get it.
- You act first and inform us later.

742
00:50:04,541 --> 00:50:07,083
- Look at you now. The choices you've made.
- Weird, this is my life.

743
00:50:07,166 --> 00:50:10,291
- Why are you so involved?
- Excuse me. Please lower your volume.

744
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:12,000
Because there are other customers.

745
00:50:12,083 --> 00:50:13,000
Thanks.

746
00:50:17,333 --> 00:50:19,291
Who is Cheng Jiang-Qing?

747
00:50:24,541 --> 00:50:27,625
You should think about this.
You're always like this.

748
00:50:28,166 --> 00:50:30,125
Hey, what's going on?

749
00:50:30,208 --> 00:50:32,291
I was only away for two minutes.

750
00:50:36,125 --> 00:50:38,583
- I don't have two.
- No card, drink up!

751
00:50:39,083 --> 00:50:40,375
Over there.

752
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:44,500
Full house with six.

753
00:50:45,583 --> 00:50:47,000
Too high, I don't have it.

754
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,166
- No card, drink up!
- A-Ming.

755
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,166
None.

756
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:51,583
I need to talk to you.

757
00:50:51,666 --> 00:50:54,875
Every time she comes to me, it's never for
anything good. Let's hear it. What is it?

758
00:50:55,375 --> 00:50:58,750
{\an8}I need to take a day off on the 15th.
Grandma's 60th birthday.

759
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:02,958
{\an8}- See? Didn't I call it?
- Arrange the work schedule for me.

760
00:51:04,083 --> 00:51:07,333
It’s either being late or leaving early.
You talk to Xiao-Ping yourself.

761
00:51:07,416 --> 00:51:09,291
So she can make her own schedule now?

762
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:11,208
You do it for me.

763
00:51:11,291 --> 00:51:12,250
Big Two.

764
00:51:12,333 --> 00:51:13,291
Pass.

765
00:51:13,375 --> 00:51:14,416
Girl!

766
00:51:15,833 --> 00:51:17,208
What do you need?

767
00:51:17,291 --> 00:51:19,541
{\an8}I want leaf wraps.

768
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:28,666
- What's wrong with her?
- I don't know. I will check on her.

769
00:51:31,583 --> 00:51:32,958
Are you okay?

770
00:51:33,041 --> 00:51:34,333
Come check it out!

771
00:51:35,208 --> 00:51:36,750
Special sale today!

772
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:52,125
Shu-Fen.

773
00:51:52,625 --> 00:51:55,625
Do you remember drinking at your place
that day? You got drunk in the end?

774
00:51:59,833 --> 00:52:01,125
You fell asleep later.

775
00:52:01,208 --> 00:52:04,375
Do you remember anything
before you fell asleep?

776
00:52:12,416 --> 00:52:14,125
I was drunk that day too.

777
00:52:15,041 --> 00:52:17,583
But it was fun. I am thinking…

778
00:52:17,666 --> 00:52:20,541
if there's a chance,

779
00:52:20,625 --> 00:52:21,916
I could…

780
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,125
go to your place again…

781
00:52:32,083 --> 00:52:34,208
I'll let you work. Carry on.

782
00:52:46,041 --> 00:52:46,916
I-Jing!

783
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,041
What?

784
00:52:48,125 --> 00:52:49,333
What are you doing?

785
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:51,875
Nothing. Just browsing.

786
00:52:51,958 --> 00:52:54,125
- Let's go have some shaved ice!
- Okay.

787
00:53:55,125 --> 00:53:57,041
GooGoo, I am going to throw the ball.

788
00:53:58,083 --> 00:53:58,958
Look!

789
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:39,791
GooGoo, don't bother me.

790
00:54:39,875 --> 00:54:42,166
I'm drawing right now.

791
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:43,958
This will be the last throw.

792
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:57,458
GooGoo!

793
00:55:09,916 --> 00:55:12,000
<i>Now I am at the scene of the accident.</i>

794
00:55:12,083 --> 00:55:14,375
<i>There was just a motorcycle</i>
<i>self-crash accident here.</i>

795
00:55:14,458 --> 00:55:16,291
{\an8}<i>When the motorcycle passed here,</i>

796
00:55:16,375 --> 00:55:19,083
{\an8}<i>it seems like a meerkat fell from the sky.</i>

797
00:55:19,166 --> 00:55:20,416
{\an8}<i>The motorcyclist was so startled</i>

798
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,583
{\an8}<i>that they couldn't react in time</i>
<i>and fell to the ground</i>

799
00:55:22,666 --> 00:55:24,291
{\an8}<i>I don’t know from which floor.</i>

800
00:55:24,375 --> 00:55:27,375
<i>A little animal fell down.</i>
<i>I didn't see it clearly.</i>

801
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:29,833
<i>And it hit the motorcyclist.</i>

802
00:55:29,916 --> 00:55:31,250
<i>Then he slammed on the brakes.</i>

803
00:55:31,333 --> 00:55:33,666
<i>Then he charged toward that direction.</i>
<i>And then he fell down.</i>

804
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:35,125
<i>And he started bleeding.</i>

805
00:55:35,208 --> 00:55:36,833
<i>I was scared to death.</i>

806
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:40,375
<i>A mouse that's bigger</i>
<i>than a cat fell from the sky.</i>

807
00:55:40,458 --> 00:55:43,041
<i>Did it fall right in front of you or what?</i>

808
00:55:43,125 --> 00:55:46,333
<i>It fell in front of my body.</i>

809
00:55:46,416 --> 00:55:47,750
<i>I was startled.</i>

810
00:55:47,833 --> 00:55:51,375
<i>- Are you in pain?</i>
<i>- What nonsense are you talking about?</i>

811
00:55:51,458 --> 00:55:53,000
<i>We can take a look at the scene.</i>

812
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:56,375
<i>There is a long skid mark on the ground</i>
<i>at the scene, left by the motorcyclist.</i>

813
00:55:56,458 --> 00:55:58,375
<i>There's a pool of unidentified blood</i>
<i>at the scene.</i>

814
00:55:58,458 --> 00:56:00,333
<i>Not sure if it's the motorcyclist's</i>
<i>or meerkat's.</i>

815
00:56:00,416 --> 00:56:03,000
<i>Why on earth the meerkat</i>
<i>would fall from the sky?</i>

816
00:56:03,083 --> 00:56:05,291
<i>Relevant details are yet</i>
<i>to be clarified by the police.</i>

817
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,500
Okay, enough.

818
00:56:06,583 --> 00:56:08,750
Why does it keep replaying?
It's so annoying.

819
00:56:09,625 --> 00:56:12,208
Can I go see it?

820
00:56:12,291 --> 00:56:15,541
No. The landlord knows we have a pet,
we might get kicked out.

821
00:56:16,125 --> 00:56:19,958
Why did it have to jump down
with the ball?

822
00:56:20,958 --> 00:56:22,166
Not your fault.

823
00:56:22,666 --> 00:56:24,791
I know it's not my fault.

824
00:56:24,875 --> 00:56:27,666
That's the Devil's fault.

825
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,916
It's okay.

826
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,500
Don't worry, okay?

827
00:56:33,583 --> 00:56:35,041
Don't be sad.

828
00:56:43,291 --> 00:56:44,333
Hey.

829
00:56:45,583 --> 00:56:47,541
Which one of you is Cheng I-Ann?

830
00:56:48,416 --> 00:56:49,666
You?

831
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:51,041
Come outside with me.

832
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:52,375
What the fuck!

833
00:56:52,458 --> 00:56:55,916
- Vixen! Think you can sleep with husbands?
- You fucking psycho, who are you? What?

834
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,750
- A-Ming!
- You don't get it?

835
00:56:57,833 --> 00:56:59,500
This is my husband’s stand!

836
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,458
What? Who are you?

837
00:57:01,541 --> 00:57:06,000
- You slept with my husband, got it?
- Didn't you say you're divorced?

838
00:57:06,875 --> 00:57:08,250
I've never said that.

839
00:57:08,333 --> 00:57:10,041
You told me you're divorced!

840
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:12,250
Fuck you! Don’t touch my husband!

841
00:57:12,333 --> 00:57:14,958
What the fuck is your problem?
You crazy bitch!

842
00:57:15,041 --> 00:57:16,708
- How dare you hit me?
- Wait!

843
00:57:16,791 --> 00:57:17,958
- Don't run away!
- Calm down!

844
00:57:18,041 --> 00:57:20,125
- Cheng I-Ann, come back here!
- This is embarrassing!

845
00:57:20,208 --> 00:57:21,333
Don't pull me!

846
00:57:21,416 --> 00:57:23,750
I am out! I fucking quit!

847
00:57:23,833 --> 00:57:26,291
Hey, you cannot quit.
Who's going to take care of my shop?

848
00:57:26,375 --> 00:57:29,625
Run as far as you can, please!
Don’t let me see you again!

849
00:57:29,708 --> 00:57:30,875
You should die!

850
00:57:31,375 --> 00:57:34,291
Forgot to tell you, he never wore a condom
and he came inside me.

851
00:57:34,375 --> 00:57:35,916
I am pregnant with his kid, peace out!

852
00:59:21,375 --> 00:59:23,541
This is a fast charger.
It charges in five minutes,

853
00:59:23,625 --> 00:59:25,583
then you can talk for five hours.
200 dollars each.

854
00:59:25,666 --> 00:59:27,041
- Okay.
- Thanks.

855
00:59:27,125 --> 00:59:28,541
- Thank you.
- Come again.

856
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:30,833
Take a look.

857
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:32,833
- Johnny.
- Yeah.

858
00:59:32,916 --> 00:59:35,625
Don't I often promote
your products for you?

859
00:59:35,708 --> 00:59:38,625
- Yes.
- You should pay me for the advertising.

860
00:59:39,291 --> 00:59:42,041
Oh. You're charging me
for advertising fees?

861
00:59:45,458 --> 00:59:46,333
{\an8}Is it enough?

862
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:47,458
{\an8}Yes.

863
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,500
- You have to help me with promotion again.
- Okay.

864
00:59:51,125 --> 00:59:52,750
100 for 10 times.

865
00:59:52,833 --> 00:59:54,250
Okay.

866
01:00:29,166 --> 01:00:30,625
I only need one.

867
01:00:32,083 --> 01:00:33,416
50 is your change.

868
01:00:39,166 --> 01:00:41,166
This is called a Magic Sponge.

869
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:43,208
It is incredibly absorbent.
Come, you can touch it.

870
01:00:43,291 --> 01:00:46,625
Come, you can check it out.
Young girl, wanna check it out?

871
01:00:50,083 --> 01:00:53,291
Don't miss it if you're passing by!

872
01:00:55,416 --> 01:00:57,791
Last time my guy in New York told me

873
01:00:57,875 --> 01:01:01,875
you talked nonstop
for 15 hours on the plane.

874
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:03,875
That's not true.

875
01:01:03,958 --> 01:01:06,875
Besides, we got along great.

876
01:01:07,875 --> 01:01:09,958
As long as you know the drill.

877
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:13,458
Make sure she still looks
exactly like her passport photo.

878
01:01:13,958 --> 01:01:16,125
You do the talking at the customs.

879
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:18,791
No worries.

880
01:01:19,541 --> 01:01:21,458
Call me when you're back.

881
01:01:22,041 --> 01:01:23,583
Okay.

882
01:01:23,666 --> 01:01:26,416
Aren't you going to dance?

883
01:01:38,125 --> 01:01:39,375
Table two.

884
01:01:50,875 --> 01:01:54,541
Boss, sorry.
I-Jing, take a break. I'll clean it up.

885
01:01:55,125 --> 01:01:56,416
Cheng I-Jing!

886
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:58,666
What are you doing?

887
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,916
You tell me,
how many times have I come here?

888
01:02:36,833 --> 01:02:38,375
Did I receive the rent?

889
01:02:39,041 --> 01:02:40,708
Where is your credibility?

890
01:02:42,166 --> 01:02:44,041
I’m giving you a three-day deadline!

891
01:02:44,125 --> 01:02:47,125
The final deadline.
If you don't have the money, get lost.

892
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:51,583
If I had the money,
I would definitely give it to you.

893
01:02:51,666 --> 01:02:54,166
Don't be like that. There are
so many people in the night market.

894
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:55,916
What did I say
when you came the first day?

895
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,166
I told you the payment's due
on the first of every month.

896
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:00,458
- Don't be like that!
- What do you think this place is?

897
01:03:01,041 --> 01:03:02,666
- A charity?
- All right.

898
01:03:03,166 --> 01:03:05,291
All right. Enough.

899
01:03:05,375 --> 01:03:06,458
Three days!

900
01:03:18,541 --> 01:03:19,750
Shu-Fen.

901
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:23,791
Let me help you.

902
01:03:28,458 --> 01:03:30,625
I'll figure something out.

903
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:33,583
I'll get the money.

904
01:03:57,458 --> 01:03:59,083
Why are you smoking in my room?

905
01:03:59,166 --> 01:04:01,125
Go smoke on the balcony!

906
01:04:01,208 --> 01:04:03,541
Why are you home?

907
01:04:03,625 --> 01:04:05,833
Aren't you supposed to be at work?

908
01:04:05,916 --> 01:04:07,541
Mind your own business.

909
01:04:07,625 --> 01:04:09,541
Is it not okay to watch TV?

910
01:04:10,583 --> 01:04:13,416
She hasn’t gone to work at this hour,
she probably got fired.

911
01:04:21,125 --> 01:04:25,125
We're out of money,
you need to go to work.

912
01:04:25,208 --> 01:04:27,375
You're all talk.
Why don’t you go make money yourself?

913
01:04:27,916 --> 01:04:29,166
I am too young!

914
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:30,125
Whatever.

915
01:04:47,041 --> 01:04:49,583
I have something important
to discuss with Grandma later.

916
01:04:49,666 --> 01:04:51,958
Stay quiet over there, got it?

917
01:04:52,041 --> 01:04:53,291
Okay.

918
01:04:56,541 --> 01:04:57,916
Here you are.

919
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,708
Come in.

920
01:04:59,791 --> 01:05:01,541
I am cooking braised meat.

921
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,750
Hello, I-Jing, here you are.

922
01:05:09,666 --> 01:05:11,416
Why are you here?

923
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,750
Mom called and invited me over.

924
01:05:13,833 --> 01:05:15,750
Aren't you the one
who hates social visits?

925
01:05:17,583 --> 01:05:19,166
Go look at the fish.

926
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:22,666
Mom, why did you tell her
I was coming over?

927
01:05:23,833 --> 01:05:28,250
- What's the big deal? This isn't a secret.
- But I need to talk to you privately.

928
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:31,583
Why do you two always end up
arguing as soon as you meet?

929
01:05:31,666 --> 01:05:33,583
When did I argue with her?

930
01:05:34,125 --> 01:05:35,916
What secret are you trying to tell?

931
01:05:37,375 --> 01:05:39,875
Mom, I'm not asking for much.

932
01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:42,833
Only three months.

933
01:05:43,458 --> 01:05:46,000
It should take about three months
to get back to normal.

934
01:05:46,083 --> 01:05:48,958
I already promised your sisters
I would not lend you money anymore.

935
01:05:49,041 --> 01:05:51,458
What does it have to do with them?
I'm not borrowing from them.

936
01:05:52,958 --> 01:05:55,583
Why did you clean up his mess again?

937
01:06:00,458 --> 01:06:01,750
Fish are so dumb.

938
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:09,166
Fish have no wisdom, so stupid.

939
01:06:10,458 --> 01:06:12,875
At least you can help out
the family a bit, right?

940
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:14,916
Don't forget, miss.

941
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,833
You still owe me the rent for that house
and haven't paid me back yet.

942
01:06:20,166 --> 01:06:21,041
Hello?

943
01:06:21,125 --> 01:06:22,083
I-Ann.

944
01:06:22,166 --> 01:06:23,041
This is A-Ming.

945
01:06:23,791 --> 01:06:25,208
I need to talk to you.

946
01:06:25,291 --> 01:06:26,333
Fuck you, shut up.

947
01:06:26,416 --> 01:06:28,500
I have something important
to discuss with you.

948
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:33,250
What about when his factory closed down?

949
01:06:33,333 --> 01:06:35,708
Why didn’t any family members
come forward to help?

950
01:06:36,791 --> 01:06:39,625
You are such a pain.

951
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:42,875
Cheng Shu-Fen. Get your facts straight!

952
01:06:42,958 --> 01:06:47,791
You're married off already. Shame on you!
How dare you come back to borrow money?

953
01:06:48,291 --> 01:06:50,083
Why are you eavesdropping
on our conversation?

954
01:06:50,166 --> 01:06:52,833
I’m begging you, please wake up!

955
01:06:52,916 --> 01:06:54,791
How long do they need to drag on?

956
01:06:54,875 --> 01:06:57,000
How many times do you need to borrow?

957
01:06:57,791 --> 01:07:01,208
I can’t stand you repeating
the same thing over and over.

958
01:07:01,291 --> 01:07:04,208
All right. Stop arguing already!
My blood pressure is spiking!

959
01:07:07,625 --> 01:07:08,791
Let me tell you.

960
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:12,625
I… really have no money to lend you.

961
01:07:12,708 --> 01:07:14,041
Heard it?

962
01:07:14,125 --> 01:07:15,958
No money to lend you!

963
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:19,625
If I were your son, you would have money!

964
01:07:19,708 --> 01:07:20,541
That's right.

965
01:07:21,791 --> 01:07:24,750
A married daughter's like water that's
poured out. I treat my daughters nice.

966
01:07:24,833 --> 01:07:27,416
In the end,
you’re someone else's daughter-in-law.

967
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:29,166
Mom kindly helped you.

968
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:31,916
You should be more grateful. When your
husband runs away, don’t yell--

969
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,625
- Watch your bitchy mouth!
- Stop talking nonsense over there!

970
01:07:35,708 --> 01:07:38,208
If it weren’t for the noodle stand
not being able to stay afloat,

971
01:07:38,291 --> 01:07:39,541
do you think I would be here?

972
01:07:39,625 --> 01:07:41,708
Whatever. I don’t know!

973
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:51,833
Let's go home.

974
01:07:51,916 --> 01:07:53,416
Don't forget, you're a woman.

975
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:56,500
Do you know this apartment has already
been transferred to our brother’s name?

976
01:07:56,583 --> 01:07:57,708
Idiot!

977
01:08:04,083 --> 01:08:05,041
Mom!

978
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:09,625
- What is it?
- Is what she said true?

979
01:08:09,708 --> 01:08:11,041
What?

980
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:14,208
Didn't you say this apartment
would be divided into three parts?

981
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:42,125
I-Jing!

982
01:08:42,958 --> 01:08:45,041
Go help me arrange the chairs!

983
01:08:50,041 --> 01:08:51,041
I-Jing!

984
01:08:53,666 --> 01:08:54,791
I-Jing!

985
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:52,000
PAWN SHOP

986
01:10:08,083 --> 01:10:10,916
Hello, I-Ann? This is A-Ming.
I have something to tell you.

987
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,375
<i>- Whose number is this?</i>
- Don't worry about that for now!

988
01:10:13,458 --> 01:10:15,125
I called you nonstop,
but you didn’t answer.

989
01:10:15,208 --> 01:10:17,250
I have nothing to say to you.
Fuck your mother!

990
01:10:17,333 --> 01:10:19,458
Fuck your rotten stand.
Fuck your crazy ugly wife!

991
01:10:19,541 --> 01:10:20,833
<i>The baby in your belly…</i>

992
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:55,833
Why are they here so early? Let me check.

993
01:12:07,125 --> 01:12:08,541
Are you Wu Xue-Mei?

994
01:12:08,625 --> 01:12:11,208
Yes. What's the matter?

995
01:12:11,291 --> 01:12:13,750
National Immigration Agency.
We're going to search your house.

996
01:12:14,416 --> 01:12:16,791
Please come in.

997
01:12:24,458 --> 01:12:28,000
I clearly put the passports
and tickets on the table yesterday.

998
01:12:28,083 --> 01:12:30,291
The cops came
and suddenly everything disappeared.

999
01:12:30,375 --> 01:12:33,958
I'm telling you,
everything suddenly disappeared!

1000
01:12:34,041 --> 01:12:37,458
Mom, the police are already gone.
You don't have to speak so quietly.

1001
01:12:38,166 --> 01:12:39,750
Also, why do they have a search warrant?

1002
01:12:39,833 --> 01:12:43,291
<i>The District Prosecutor's Office</i>
<i>has legally indicted 21 people.</i>

1003
01:12:43,375 --> 01:12:46,541
Thank goodness. I didn't end up in jail.

1004
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:49,416
What a blessing!

1005
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:51,208
Okay, everyone be quiet.

1006
01:12:51,291 --> 01:12:53,083
Line up two in a row.

1007
01:12:53,166 --> 01:12:56,583
Come, go out and put on your shoes.
We can go outside and play now!

1008
01:12:57,083 --> 01:12:59,833
- Play outside!
- Okay!

1009
01:13:01,208 --> 01:13:04,166
Find your own shoes then move forward.

1010
01:13:10,458 --> 01:13:12,541
Find your shoes then go to the front.

1011
01:13:12,625 --> 01:13:15,041
Let others put theirs on. Be careful.

1012
01:13:15,125 --> 01:13:19,416
The cops probably lifted the passports
when you weren’t looking.

1013
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:20,791
Oh, that's possible!

1014
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,958
You idiot!

1015
01:13:51,041 --> 01:13:54,500
I'm telling you, no matter how much
you make, it's not worth the risk.

1016
01:13:54,583 --> 01:13:58,333
How about you with
your porno magazine stash under the bed?

1017
01:13:58,416 --> 01:14:01,208
When the police came they turned
everything over. Aren't you embarrassed?

1018
01:14:01,291 --> 01:14:03,250
That's called art.
What the fuck do you know?

1019
01:14:03,333 --> 01:14:04,458
Art my ass.

1020
01:14:04,541 --> 01:14:07,791
They all look the same anyway.

1021
01:14:07,875 --> 01:14:09,458
What a heathen.

1022
01:14:18,916 --> 01:14:22,416
I have something very valuable for you.

1023
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:23,875
What is it?

1024
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,625
Whose is this?

1025
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:50,916
Mine.

1026
01:14:54,375 --> 01:14:56,208
Why are you pawning this?

1027
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,625
Because my mom has no money,
she needs money.

1028
01:15:02,291 --> 01:15:04,375
Does she know you are pawning this?

1029
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:05,958
No.

1030
01:15:21,833 --> 01:15:24,833
Try calling again, I dare you!
Believe me, I'll call the police!

1031
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,041
Huh?

1032
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,041
I thought the Devil Hand could help.

1033
01:15:36,125 --> 01:15:38,000
What are you talking about?

1034
01:15:38,083 --> 01:15:41,791
I wanted to get money to help Mom.

1035
01:15:42,291 --> 01:15:44,791
What money? What Devil Hand?
I don't understand.

1036
01:15:44,875 --> 01:15:47,166
This is my Devil Hand.

1037
01:15:49,666 --> 01:15:51,458
I am not the one who stole things.

1038
01:15:51,541 --> 01:15:53,958
It was my Devil Hand
that stole everything!

1039
01:15:54,041 --> 01:15:55,458
Not me.

1040
01:15:55,958 --> 01:15:57,333
Who told you all this?

1041
01:15:57,416 --> 01:15:58,833
Grandpa.

1042
01:16:01,875 --> 01:16:02,916
Slow down.

1043
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,625
Cut it out! Hurry up.

1044
01:16:04,708 --> 01:16:06,625
Where exactly are we going?

1045
01:16:06,708 --> 01:16:08,416
Let's go visit Grandpa first.

1046
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:10,958
I-Ann?

1047
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:13,875
What's wrong?

1048
01:16:14,666 --> 01:16:16,500
What's wrong?

1049
01:16:19,625 --> 01:16:22,458
Grandma! Was it you who told her
this was valuable?

1050
01:16:28,166 --> 01:16:29,458
The passports?!

1051
01:16:30,708 --> 01:16:34,250
My dear sweetheart, thank you.

1052
01:16:34,333 --> 01:16:36,416
If it weren’t for you,
Grandma would be locked up.

1053
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:37,416
Thank you.

1054
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:39,625
The Devil Hand did it!

1055
01:16:39,708 --> 01:16:40,583
Not me!

1056
01:16:41,541 --> 01:16:42,666
Grandpa!

1057
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:45,791
Can you please tell her
there is no such thing as the Devil Hand?

1058
01:16:45,875 --> 01:16:48,208
The left hand has always been
the Devil Hand, okay?

1059
01:16:48,291 --> 01:16:51,000
You're not supposed to use
your left hand to do things.

1060
01:16:51,083 --> 01:16:52,916
I'm telling you,
none of you are teaching her.

1061
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,625
Which era are you from?

1062
01:16:54,708 --> 01:16:56,583
Women don't bind their feet anymore.

1063
01:16:57,083 --> 01:16:58,458
Lefties are everywhere now!

1064
01:16:58,541 --> 01:17:01,458
Please tell her.
The Devil Hand doesn't exist at all.

1065
01:17:01,541 --> 01:17:02,458
Okay.

1066
01:17:02,541 --> 01:17:04,208
There is no Devil Hand.

1067
01:17:04,291 --> 01:17:08,208
It's God's hand.
It's the hand that saves Grandma.

1068
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:11,375
Grandma, can you stop confusing her?

1069
01:17:12,208 --> 01:17:14,541
I-Jing, let me tell you.

1070
01:17:14,625 --> 01:17:17,416
There's no Devil Hand
or any other supernatural hand.

1071
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:18,750
This is your hand.

1072
01:17:18,833 --> 01:17:19,666
Do you hear me?

1073
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:25,083
I threw the ball with my left hand
and caused GooGoo to die.

1074
01:17:25,166 --> 01:17:27,083
That was just an accident.

1075
01:17:27,625 --> 01:17:30,708
Sometimes accidents happen.
No one can predict them, right?

1076
01:17:31,958 --> 01:17:35,000
If that day… if you had thrown the ball
with your right hand,

1077
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:38,041
GooGoo would still have fallen, right?

1078
01:17:38,666 --> 01:17:41,708
I've done a lot of bad things
with my left hand.

1079
01:17:41,791 --> 01:17:44,416
Huh? What other bad things have you done?

1080
01:17:47,916 --> 01:17:49,750
Did you steal all of this?

1081
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:53,000
My Devil Hand did it.

1082
01:17:53,083 --> 01:17:55,791
Cheng I-Jing, you stole them.

1083
01:18:07,375 --> 01:18:09,750
do you know your child has been missing
for three hours?

1084
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:12,750
Wasn't she playing nearby?

1085
01:18:15,291 --> 01:18:16,291
Let's go.

1086
01:18:19,041 --> 01:18:20,666
Where are you two going?

1087
01:18:21,291 --> 01:18:22,708
To teach her a lesson.

1088
01:18:24,916 --> 01:18:27,250
By the way, this is from your mom.

1089
01:18:58,666 --> 01:19:00,458
I-Jing, are you here to visit me?

1090
01:19:01,666 --> 01:19:04,375
Yes, I am here to return something.

1091
01:19:05,375 --> 01:19:06,708
What do you say?

1092
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:08,666
I am sorry.

1093
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:10,208
I stole this.

1094
01:19:10,291 --> 01:19:12,083
It's okay.
If you like something, just tell me.

1095
01:19:12,166 --> 01:19:15,125
- Don't take it without asking.
- I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

1096
01:19:15,208 --> 01:19:17,458
It's all right.
I-Jing, come visit me next time.

1097
01:19:17,541 --> 01:19:18,833
- Okay.
- What do you say?

1098
01:19:18,916 --> 01:19:19,958
Say thank you.

1099
01:19:20,041 --> 01:19:21,166
"Thank you. Sorry."

1100
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:22,583
Thank you. I'm sorry.

1101
01:19:22,666 --> 01:19:23,500
It's all right.

1102
01:19:24,666 --> 01:19:25,791
Sorry about this.

1103
01:19:27,291 --> 01:19:28,541
Sorry, sis.

1104
01:19:28,625 --> 01:19:31,166
It's okay. Go. Let's go.

1105
01:19:34,791 --> 01:19:37,000
Where did you steal this from? That one?

1106
01:19:37,083 --> 01:19:38,041
That store?

1107
01:19:41,791 --> 01:19:43,041
Wait.

1108
01:19:43,833 --> 01:19:45,125
Go return it yourself.

1109
01:19:45,208 --> 01:19:46,458
You have to apologize.

1110
01:19:46,541 --> 01:19:47,583
Got it?

1111
01:19:47,666 --> 01:19:48,541
Go.

1112
01:19:51,166 --> 01:19:52,916
I-Jing, here you are.

1113
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:55,791
I stole this.

1114
01:19:55,875 --> 01:19:56,750
Huh?

1115
01:19:58,916 --> 01:20:00,833
Okay. No big deal.

1116
01:20:00,916 --> 01:20:02,375
No big deal, okay?

1117
01:20:02,458 --> 01:20:04,541
- Don't do it again, okay?
- Okay.

1118
01:20:04,625 --> 01:20:06,000
Okay.

1119
01:20:06,083 --> 01:20:08,083
No big deal. Bye-bye.

1120
01:20:14,125 --> 01:20:15,625
Did you apologize?

1121
01:20:15,708 --> 01:20:17,083
Yes.

1122
01:20:17,166 --> 01:20:18,583
Did the owner forgive you?

1123
01:20:18,666 --> 01:20:19,625
Yes.

1124
01:20:19,708 --> 01:20:21,166
You are doing great! Okay?

1125
01:20:22,708 --> 01:20:24,625
Remember to say sorry.

1126
01:20:26,041 --> 01:20:27,333
You got it?

1127
01:20:29,833 --> 01:20:30,833
Go.

1128
01:20:34,541 --> 01:20:37,708
I am sorry I stole this from you.

1129
01:20:38,791 --> 01:20:41,250
It's okay. Don't do it again.

1130
01:20:43,958 --> 01:20:46,541
Bye-bye. Come here.

1131
01:20:51,791 --> 01:20:54,541
I'm sorry I stole this from you.

1132
01:20:54,625 --> 01:20:58,458
Little girl, you are here again?
Why did you take it?

1133
01:20:58,541 --> 01:21:02,375
Okay, it's all right. Don't do it again.

1134
01:21:03,041 --> 01:21:03,958
It's all right.

1135
01:21:04,041 --> 01:21:05,625
Be good. Bye-bye.

1136
01:21:06,583 --> 01:21:07,750
Don't do it again.

1137
01:21:07,833 --> 01:21:09,083
Okay.

1138
01:21:09,625 --> 01:21:10,625
Did you apologize?

1139
01:21:11,416 --> 01:21:14,125
Did you? Okay, that's good. Okay?

1140
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:21,583
It's okay.

1141
01:21:40,125 --> 01:21:42,291
Turn around. I'll help you tie the bow.

1142
01:21:45,125 --> 01:21:48,708
Okay. The bow is done.

1143
01:21:49,541 --> 01:21:52,416
Are the night market sisters ready?

1144
01:21:53,916 --> 01:21:57,416
You are so pretty!
You are going to perform on stage, right?

1145
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:58,708
She wouldn't dare.

1146
01:22:00,958 --> 01:22:02,875
- Are you two ready?
- Pretty. Ready?

1147
01:22:02,958 --> 01:22:05,291
- Let's go. We can't be late. Hurry up.
- You ready?

1148
01:22:05,375 --> 01:22:07,750
Let's go. Hurry up, we are late.

1149
01:22:13,041 --> 01:22:14,041
Hey.

1150
01:22:14,125 --> 01:22:15,458
Your turn.

1151
01:22:15,541 --> 01:22:17,250
- Where are we?
- Six.

1152
01:22:17,333 --> 01:22:18,208
Seven.

1153
01:22:18,291 --> 01:22:19,666
Why are you zoning out?

1154
01:22:21,291 --> 01:22:23,333
Forget about her.

1155
01:22:23,416 --> 01:22:25,166
Xiao-Ping is hotter.

1156
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:27,833
Stop acting like you know something
and talking nonsense.

1157
01:22:27,916 --> 01:22:30,500
It has nothing to do with her. Seven.

1158
01:22:30,583 --> 01:22:33,875
Always taking leave for no reason.
Always acting like a green-eyed monster.

1159
01:22:33,958 --> 01:22:35,541
Why are you thinking about her?

1160
01:22:36,125 --> 01:22:37,333
Taking days off?

1161
01:22:37,916 --> 01:22:39,791
By the way, what's the date today?

1162
01:22:39,875 --> 01:22:40,875
Friday.

1163
01:22:40,958 --> 01:22:43,583
No, I mean the date!
Not what day of the week it is.

1164
01:22:44,166 --> 01:22:45,333
The 15th.

1165
01:22:46,750 --> 01:22:48,958
Didn't she say the 15th is
her grandmother's birthday?

1166
01:22:49,625 --> 01:22:51,958
Yes, her grandma's birthday!

1167
01:22:54,958 --> 01:22:56,541
Okay, thank you.

1168
01:22:56,625 --> 01:22:59,166
You are very pretty, the best!

1169
01:22:59,750 --> 01:23:01,875
You can have some appetizers
and drink first.

1170
01:23:03,666 --> 01:23:06,625
If you want to take photos together,
we are ready.

1171
01:23:06,708 --> 01:23:09,041
- Is it the time to start?
- Yes.

1172
01:23:11,250 --> 01:23:12,583
Okay, get off first.

1173
01:23:13,083 --> 01:23:14,666
I'll help you with the helmet.

1174
01:23:16,041 --> 01:23:17,458
Let me have it.

1175
01:23:17,541 --> 01:23:18,708
Let me help you.

1176
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:21,958
Good.

1177
01:23:22,916 --> 01:23:24,500
- This one?
- Yes.

1178
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:25,958
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

1179
01:23:26,041 --> 01:23:26,958
Let's go.

1180
01:23:27,041 --> 01:23:27,958
Wait for me.

1181
01:23:39,166 --> 01:23:41,250
Shu-Fen, they are all relatives today?

1182
01:23:41,333 --> 01:23:42,500
Should be.

1183
01:23:49,791 --> 01:23:50,791
You sit inside.

1184
01:23:50,875 --> 01:23:51,833
Okay.

1185
01:23:51,916 --> 01:23:53,208
- We're here.
- Big sis.

1186
01:23:53,291 --> 01:23:55,125
How are you?

1187
01:23:55,208 --> 01:23:57,416
Hi, everyone. My name is Johnny.

1188
01:23:58,125 --> 01:24:00,208
- My boyfriend, Johnny.
- Xiao-He.

1189
01:24:00,291 --> 01:24:01,666
- Xiao-He.
- Xiao-Hong.

1190
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:03,541
- Xiao-Hong, hi.
- This is my brother.

1191
01:24:03,625 --> 01:24:04,791
Her brother.

1192
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:07,125
Zhen-Xing, I am Johnny.

1193
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:09,416
Sit. Why don't you sit down?

1194
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:11,625
Oh, I-Ann. Come say hi.

1195
01:24:12,458 --> 01:24:14,000
You've grown up.

1196
01:24:14,083 --> 01:24:15,000
Uncle.

1197
01:24:15,083 --> 01:24:17,333
Hi, Uncle. Long time no see.

1198
01:24:17,416 --> 01:24:18,791
I-Jing, the little one.

1199
01:24:18,875 --> 01:24:19,875
Her little one.

1200
01:24:19,958 --> 01:24:21,250
- I haven't met her.
- I-Jing.

1201
01:24:21,958 --> 01:24:23,291
Say uncle.

1202
01:24:26,416 --> 01:24:27,875
You guys go sit over there.

1203
01:24:27,958 --> 01:24:29,791
Kids sit over there.
Auntie will take you there.

1204
01:24:29,875 --> 01:24:30,833
Okay.

1205
01:24:30,916 --> 01:24:32,333
Let the adults talk.

1206
01:24:32,416 --> 01:24:33,625
Your daughter?

1207
01:24:34,958 --> 01:24:37,791
No. We've only known each other
for six months.

1208
01:24:37,875 --> 01:24:40,000
Just met.

1209
01:24:40,083 --> 01:24:41,375
Not long.

1210
01:24:41,458 --> 01:24:43,708
Anything to drink?
Give me the cup. I will help you.

1211
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:45,375
- Anything.
- Thank you.

1212
01:24:45,458 --> 01:24:47,083
Can I use your phone?

1213
01:24:47,166 --> 01:24:48,083
May I ask,

1214
01:24:48,166 --> 01:24:51,750
is there a Ms. Wu Xue-Mei's
birthday banquet?

1215
01:24:52,583 --> 01:24:54,125
Yes.

1216
01:24:55,833 --> 01:24:56,875
Is there?

1217
01:24:56,958 --> 01:24:58,333
Okay. Thank you. Got it.

1218
01:24:58,416 --> 01:24:59,708
Bye-bye.

1219
01:25:05,583 --> 01:25:07,083
Sis, you moved back to Taipei?

1220
01:25:08,916 --> 01:25:10,833
How long are you staying this time?

1221
01:25:13,125 --> 01:25:14,416
Just for the weekend.

1222
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:15,625
Work is busy.

1223
01:25:16,125 --> 01:25:17,541
I just moved to Shanghai.

1224
01:25:19,916 --> 01:25:21,375
- Johnny.
- Nice to see you.

1225
01:25:21,458 --> 01:25:22,833
- Thank you for your hard work!
- Huh?

1226
01:25:22,916 --> 01:25:23,833
My sister is difficult.

1227
01:25:24,916 --> 01:25:27,375
Not at all. Your sister is very nice.

1228
01:25:28,791 --> 01:25:30,000
And what do you do?

1229
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:32,083
Oh, I am in…

1230
01:25:32,166 --> 01:25:33,000
trade.

1231
01:25:33,083 --> 01:25:33,958
In trade.

1232
01:25:34,041 --> 01:25:35,375
Oh. Really?

1233
01:25:35,458 --> 01:25:37,083
Have you gone public?

1234
01:25:37,166 --> 01:25:38,791
Yes. I'm at the night market.

1235
01:25:38,875 --> 01:25:41,083
Public night market trading.

1236
01:25:41,583 --> 01:25:44,916
Whatever you need. Let me know.
Anything you can't get, I can.

1237
01:25:45,666 --> 01:25:47,208
- Okay.
- Okay, no problem.

1238
01:25:47,291 --> 01:25:48,125
Thank you.

1239
01:25:48,208 --> 01:25:49,833
Who are you?

1240
01:25:51,125 --> 01:25:52,541
She's my younger sister.

1241
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:55,625
And what's your name?

1242
01:25:56,125 --> 01:25:57,333
I-Jing.

1243
01:25:57,416 --> 01:26:00,208
The birthday star is here!

1244
01:26:00,291 --> 01:26:01,250
Uncle, Auntie.

1245
01:26:01,333 --> 01:26:03,500
Happy birthday! Happy birthday!

1246
01:26:03,583 --> 01:26:05,458
You look beautiful today.

1247
01:26:05,541 --> 01:26:07,666
Happy birthday! Happy birthday!

1248
01:26:07,750 --> 01:26:08,833
Thanks.

1249
01:26:09,458 --> 01:26:10,875
Thanks.

1250
01:26:10,958 --> 01:26:11,958
Mom.

1251
01:26:12,041 --> 01:26:12,875
Come here.

1252
01:26:16,625 --> 01:26:18,500
Dad, you sit over there.

1253
01:26:18,583 --> 01:26:20,125
I am sitting with my son.

1254
01:26:20,208 --> 01:26:22,083
- Be careful.
- Dad, have some water.

1255
01:26:22,166 --> 01:26:24,041
- You rushed over?
- My precious son.

1256
01:26:24,125 --> 01:26:25,500
Here. Wanna drink some water?

1257
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,208
Dad and Mom, this is my boyfriend, Johnny.

1258
01:26:29,291 --> 01:26:30,125
Uncle.

1259
01:26:30,208 --> 01:26:31,416
Auntie, happy birthday.

1260
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:34,250
Hello, nice to meet you.

1261
01:26:35,625 --> 01:26:37,875
What do you do?

1262
01:26:37,958 --> 01:26:41,833
He has a stand in the night market.
He is right next to Fen’s stand.

1263
01:26:41,916 --> 01:26:43,541
Selling stuff.

1264
01:26:44,833 --> 01:26:47,125
I sell all kinds of things.
I have everything.

1265
01:26:47,208 --> 01:26:49,083
If you need anything, let me know.

1266
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:53,500
Hey, I have to go first.
Something came up.

1267
01:26:53,583 --> 01:26:55,375
- You are on your own tonight, okay?
- Oh, okay.

1268
01:26:55,458 --> 01:26:57,875
- Keep it up. Call me if anything comes up.
- Okay.

1269
01:26:58,416 --> 01:27:00,000
What could possibly happen?

1270
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:01,458
I don't get it.

1271
01:27:01,541 --> 01:27:04,541
All right then.
Next, let's give Mom a big applause!

1272
01:27:04,625 --> 01:27:07,750
Say a few words to us. Mom!

1273
01:27:10,791 --> 01:27:12,333
Thank you, thank you.

1274
01:27:12,416 --> 01:27:14,541
Thank you everybody, welcome!

1275
01:27:15,041 --> 01:27:17,875
Thank you for taking the time to be here.

1276
01:27:18,708 --> 01:27:20,833
My precious son.

1277
01:27:20,916 --> 01:27:22,958
So thoughtful! So devoted!

1278
01:27:23,041 --> 01:27:24,958
To throw this party for me.

1279
01:27:25,041 --> 01:27:26,583
Mom, happy birthday!

1280
01:27:26,666 --> 01:27:28,333
Thank you.

1281
01:27:28,416 --> 01:27:30,500
Thank you.

1282
01:27:31,208 --> 01:27:34,416
Before we all start eating,

1283
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:39,125
let's first make a toast,
wish Mom a happy birthday, all right?

1284
01:27:39,708 --> 01:27:41,750
Happy birthday!

1285
01:27:41,833 --> 01:27:43,541
Happy birthday!

1286
01:27:55,375 --> 01:27:58,208
- Excuse me, excuse me.
- Uncle here.

1287
01:27:58,291 --> 01:28:00,041
I'll get it myself.

1288
01:28:00,708 --> 01:28:02,208
- Thanks.
- Okay.

1289
01:28:02,291 --> 01:28:05,583
- Are there no glasses?
- Over there. The drink you just had.

1290
01:28:05,666 --> 01:28:06,958
Good girl.

1291
01:28:07,041 --> 01:28:10,416
This is my favorite granddaughter.

1292
01:28:12,041 --> 01:28:16,250
I mean, you are all my favorites.

1293
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:18,083
All my favorites.

1294
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:20,750
Grandma lied to them.

1295
01:28:20,833 --> 01:28:23,291
You are my precious baby.

1296
01:28:23,916 --> 01:28:26,458
Grandma. It's your birthday.
We toast to you.

1297
01:28:26,541 --> 01:28:27,416
Happy birthday!

1298
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:29,125
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

1299
01:28:29,208 --> 01:28:31,750
While everyone is eating,

1300
01:28:31,833 --> 01:28:35,541
I want to take this moment
to wish my mom a very happy birthday.

1301
01:28:35,625 --> 01:28:38,833
So I'd like to ask my daughter Meilin
to come up! Meilin.

1302
01:28:44,083 --> 01:28:47,166
She also advanced to
the <i>Star Brilliance Grand Finals</i>.

1303
01:28:47,250 --> 01:28:49,916
So she is going to sing the same song.

1304
01:28:50,458 --> 01:28:53,916
The judge also mentioned
if she pursues opportunities in China,

1305
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,333
her future prospects will be incredible!

1306
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,791
Mom, happy birthday!

1307
01:29:12,583 --> 01:29:14,041
Why are you so slow?

1308
01:29:14,541 --> 01:29:16,208
- You are very slow.
- Let's go, let's go.

1309
01:29:22,375 --> 01:29:24,958
Let me go get her.
You wait here. Calm down.

1310
01:29:25,458 --> 01:29:27,625
Calm down. Wait for me here.

1311
01:29:36,375 --> 01:29:37,333
I-Ann.

1312
01:29:38,041 --> 01:29:40,375
Can you come downstairs with us?
We need to talk to you.

1313
01:29:43,541 --> 01:29:44,583
Cheng I-Ann.

1314
01:29:44,666 --> 01:29:47,166
- Fuck! What are you all doing here?
- Step outside to talk.

1315
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:48,500
Cut it out!

1316
01:29:50,083 --> 01:29:53,208
We have something important to talk
to you about Please step outside.

1317
01:29:53,291 --> 01:29:55,625
I tried calling you
and you wouldn't answer. This is serious.

1318
01:29:55,708 --> 01:29:57,291
Birthday banquet, how dare you come here?

1319
01:29:57,375 --> 01:29:59,041
I'm giving you a chance to save face--

1320
01:30:00,833 --> 01:30:02,041
Shh. Get out!

1321
01:30:02,125 --> 01:30:03,416
Come out to talk.

1322
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:05,166
Get out!

1323
01:30:05,250 --> 01:30:06,750
I'm giving you a chance to save face--

1324
01:30:06,833 --> 01:30:08,000
Get out!

1325
01:30:08,083 --> 01:30:09,333
What's going on?

1326
01:30:09,416 --> 01:30:11,833
- Sorry, this has nothing to do with you.
- I am her mother.

1327
01:30:11,916 --> 01:30:13,333
You two need something?

1328
01:30:13,416 --> 01:30:14,791
You are her mother?

1329
01:30:16,166 --> 01:30:19,583
I am her former boss.
I need to talk to her. I am sorry.

1330
01:30:19,666 --> 01:30:22,500
- We've been looking for her for two weeks.
- You fucking stinky bitch!

1331
01:30:22,583 --> 01:30:24,791
- Why are you doing this?
- Come here.

1332
01:30:26,750 --> 01:30:29,041
Don't you know how many guests are here?

1333
01:30:31,625 --> 01:30:33,250
I already quit, what the fuck do you want?

1334
01:30:33,333 --> 01:30:34,416
Shut up!

1335
01:30:34,916 --> 01:30:36,541
Now you can tell me what happened.

1336
01:30:36,625 --> 01:30:39,708
How did she offend you?
You feel the need to disturb the banquet.

1337
01:30:41,791 --> 01:30:42,625
Well?

1338
01:30:43,125 --> 01:30:44,375
No one wants to tell?

1339
01:30:44,875 --> 01:30:46,458
Okay, I will tell you!

1340
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:49,458
Your daughter slept with my husband
and got pregnant!

1341
01:30:49,541 --> 01:30:52,166
There are a lot of people here.
Don’t be so loud.

1342
01:30:59,958 --> 01:31:01,125
Is it true?

1343
01:31:01,875 --> 01:31:03,250
It's none of your business.

1344
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:06,500
- I'm asking you if this is true.
- She told us herself.

1345
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,958
We have three girls now.

1346
01:31:10,041 --> 01:31:12,208
If your daughter is having a boy,
it's ours.

1347
01:31:12,833 --> 01:31:15,458
- Impossible! Are you out of your mind?
- Am I out of my mind?

1348
01:31:15,541 --> 01:31:17,791
I don’t care
that you slept with my husband.

1349
01:31:17,875 --> 01:31:21,000
At this point, I just need a son to help
divvy up the family fortune. Am I wrong?

1350
01:31:21,083 --> 01:31:23,291
You slept with my hubby for free!

1351
01:31:23,375 --> 01:31:24,958
- Enough.
- I'll go check.

1352
01:31:26,125 --> 01:31:28,791
You don't need to worry about the money.
We would pay for everything--

1353
01:31:28,875 --> 01:31:30,500
Can you shut up?

1354
01:31:30,583 --> 01:31:33,708
We would pay for all expenses.
As long as she is having a boy,

1355
01:31:33,791 --> 01:31:35,166
I'll pay for everything!

1356
01:31:36,375 --> 01:31:37,416
What's going on?

1357
01:31:38,083 --> 01:31:40,625
- I'm asking you if it is true.
- Don’t do this!

1358
01:31:40,708 --> 01:31:42,625
I'm asking you if it is true.

1359
01:31:42,708 --> 01:31:44,166
Don't do this.

1360
01:31:44,250 --> 01:31:45,500
Don't do this.

1361
01:31:46,291 --> 01:31:48,416
- She told us she's pregnant.
- Enough.

1362
01:31:50,958 --> 01:31:52,916
You are talking about this, right?

1363
01:31:53,416 --> 01:31:55,500
That's long gone, bitch!

1364
01:31:58,125 --> 01:32:00,500
- I am gonna fucking kill you today!
- What are you doing?

1365
01:32:00,583 --> 01:32:01,625
Let go!

1366
01:32:01,708 --> 01:32:04,541
- Let go!
- Let's go back! Calm down!

1367
01:32:04,625 --> 01:32:05,458
- Get out!
- Let's go!

1368
01:32:05,541 --> 01:32:08,041
- She seduced my husband--
- I'll call the police if you don't stop!

1369
01:32:08,125 --> 01:32:09,041
Enough! Let's go!

1370
01:32:09,125 --> 01:32:11,250
- Cheng I-Ann, go to hell!
- Enough!

1371
01:32:11,333 --> 01:32:12,375
It's okay.

1372
01:32:12,458 --> 01:32:14,916
- Let's go.
- Don't hold me back!

1373
01:32:15,583 --> 01:32:16,500
Get out!

1374
01:32:22,291 --> 01:32:23,500
Why aren't you leaving?

1375
01:32:31,791 --> 01:32:34,708
Sorry. Could you give this to I-Ann?

1376
01:32:45,458 --> 01:32:47,583
You still haven't learned your lesson.

1377
01:32:51,333 --> 01:32:55,041
When are you going to take
responsibility for your life? You…

1378
01:33:10,041 --> 01:33:11,208
Sit.

1379
01:33:29,583 --> 01:33:32,000
Is everything okay?

1380
01:33:32,791 --> 01:33:33,833
It's okay.

1381
01:33:36,750 --> 01:33:38,041
So…

1382
01:33:38,583 --> 01:33:41,125
What happened up there?

1383
01:33:41,625 --> 01:33:43,125
None of your business.

1384
01:33:46,541 --> 01:33:50,000
The reason your mom was so angry is
because she cares about you.

1385
01:33:52,041 --> 01:33:53,541
Do you even know my mom?

1386
01:33:55,125 --> 01:33:57,833
Just because you slept with my mom
for two weeks, you get to be my dad?

1387
01:34:04,791 --> 01:34:07,166
Sis, where did you go?

1388
01:34:24,375 --> 01:34:26,375
I talked to her.

1389
01:34:28,625 --> 01:34:30,041
There is nothing to talk about.

1390
01:34:34,958 --> 01:34:36,250
She is helpless.

1391
01:34:47,458 --> 01:34:50,541
Sorry about the commotion earlier.
Disturbed everyone.

1392
01:34:51,041 --> 01:34:54,791
First of all, thank you for attending
my dear mommy's 60th birthday banquet.

1393
01:34:54,875 --> 01:34:58,625
My mommy did everything for me,
and my dear sisters.

1394
01:35:00,166 --> 01:35:02,416
Last year,
the world economy was really bad.

1395
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:04,708
So I started an international company.

1396
01:35:04,791 --> 01:35:08,041
The purpose is to support more
families affected by unemployment.

1397
01:35:08,125 --> 01:35:10,750
So they can achieve dreams and have hopes.

1398
01:35:10,833 --> 01:35:13,000
And my biggest financial sponsor

1399
01:35:13,083 --> 01:35:14,541
is my dear mommy.

1400
01:35:14,625 --> 01:35:17,250
Please give this great philanthropist

1401
01:35:17,833 --> 01:35:19,416
a big round of applause!

1402
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:24,541
Mommy!

1403
01:35:25,083 --> 01:35:26,125
Happy birthday!

1404
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:27,666
Wishing you have a long life.

1405
01:35:35,833 --> 01:35:37,625
Let's wish our wonderful mom…

1406
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,625
Thank you for giving birth to us
and raising us, and teaching us.

1407
01:35:42,708 --> 01:35:43,541
Happy birthday!

1408
01:35:43,625 --> 01:35:46,625
May you have blessings as deep as the sea
and a life as long as the mountains.

1409
01:35:47,625 --> 01:35:51,333
We prepare a special birthday cake

1410
01:35:51,416 --> 01:35:53,083
for our mother.

1411
01:35:53,166 --> 01:35:55,916
Let's have the waiter bring it out,
shall we?

1412
01:36:02,250 --> 01:36:03,416
Wait!

1413
01:36:04,166 --> 01:36:05,750
I have something to say.

1414
01:36:08,791 --> 01:36:10,166
What's she up to?

1415
01:36:19,833 --> 01:36:20,708
Grandma.

1416
01:36:22,458 --> 01:36:25,625
Thank you
for never treating me like a child.

1417
01:36:30,833 --> 01:36:32,041
Excuse me.

1418
01:36:32,708 --> 01:36:33,708
Sorry.

1419
01:36:37,666 --> 01:36:39,500
Before we cut the cake,

1420
01:36:39,583 --> 01:36:42,333
I-Jing and I want to say
happy birthday to you.

1421
01:36:43,708 --> 01:36:45,166
Me first.

1422
01:36:45,666 --> 01:36:47,625
Grandma, happy birthday!

1423
01:36:50,291 --> 01:36:51,583
Next is I-Jing's turn.

1424
01:36:55,791 --> 01:36:56,958
Hold this.

1425
01:37:05,708 --> 01:37:06,791
Say it.

1426
01:37:09,333 --> 01:37:12,541
Great-Grandma, happy birthday.

1427
01:37:14,625 --> 01:37:17,041
Sweetie, you said it wrong!

1428
01:37:17,125 --> 01:37:18,791
I am Grandma, not Great-Grandma.

1429
01:37:18,875 --> 01:37:20,041
Say it again.

1430
01:37:20,541 --> 01:37:22,333
Great-Grandma, happy birthday.

1431
01:37:24,416 --> 01:37:26,458
I-Jing is right.

1432
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:31,833
Grandma is I-Jing's great-grandmother.

1433
01:37:33,708 --> 01:37:36,291
My mom seriously thought
she could cover it all up--

1434
01:37:36,375 --> 01:37:38,083
You're drunk.
Can you stop acting like this?

1435
01:37:38,166 --> 01:37:40,333
- I am not drunk!
- Sorry, she drank too much!

1436
01:37:40,416 --> 01:37:42,291
I gave birth to I-Jing, not you!

1437
01:37:42,916 --> 01:37:44,250
What are you doing?

1438
01:37:44,333 --> 01:37:46,666
- Can you tell me--
- She should know by now!

1439
01:37:48,166 --> 01:37:49,750
What are you talking about?

1440
01:37:54,333 --> 01:37:56,500
I only did it to protect you.

1441
01:37:56,583 --> 01:37:58,000
Why don't you understand?

1442
01:38:00,250 --> 01:38:03,583
You're so young.
With a kid, who would marry you?

1443
01:38:04,375 --> 01:38:06,333
Why do I have to marry someone?

1444
01:38:07,166 --> 01:38:10,500
For my entire life, you only care
about saving your own face!

1445
01:38:10,583 --> 01:38:12,833
Have you ever cared about how I feel?

1446
01:38:12,916 --> 01:38:14,000
Mom.

1447
01:38:15,458 --> 01:38:17,208
Why am I a great-grandmother?

1448
01:38:17,291 --> 01:38:19,833
I am a great-grandmother?

1449
01:38:20,333 --> 01:38:22,250
You better explain it right now!

1450
01:38:29,708 --> 01:38:31,666
This is so humiliating!

1451
01:38:33,541 --> 01:38:35,333
Why does it have to be today?

1452
01:38:35,416 --> 01:38:38,208
How could you lie to me
about something so serious?

1453
01:38:40,166 --> 01:38:43,125
You’ve completely made me lose face!

1454
01:38:44,083 --> 01:38:46,208
Do you have any shame at all?

1455
01:38:46,291 --> 01:38:49,208
Do you really not want me
to live in peace?

1456
01:38:51,208 --> 01:38:55,208
Or were you going to keep
this secret forever?

1457
01:38:58,916 --> 01:39:00,708
That was my original plan.

1458
01:39:06,583 --> 01:39:07,416
- Shut up!
- Mom!

1459
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:09,166
- Keep your mouth shut!
- All right.

1460
01:39:09,250 --> 01:39:11,208
Just calm her down first.

1461
01:39:11,833 --> 01:39:13,125
Bring her back here.

1462
01:39:15,250 --> 01:39:16,583
Go sit down.

1463
01:39:18,916 --> 01:39:20,208
Go sit down for now.

1464
01:39:20,291 --> 01:39:21,458
Just go sit down first.

1465
01:39:25,791 --> 01:39:26,625
Calm down.

1466
01:39:29,625 --> 01:39:32,208
Today's birthday party sure is
full of surprises.

1467
01:39:32,708 --> 01:39:35,833
Look at this
longevity peach birthday cake.

1468
01:39:36,375 --> 01:39:37,958
This is a real longevity peach!

1469
01:39:39,416 --> 01:39:43,208
Before cutting longevity peach,
first let's sing. Happy birthday song!

1470
01:39:44,041 --> 01:39:47,708
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

1471
01:39:47,791 --> 01:39:50,666
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

1472
01:39:50,750 --> 01:39:55,125
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

1473
01:39:55,208 --> 01:39:58,958
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

1474
01:41:24,291 --> 01:41:25,958
You are in a good mood today.

1475
01:41:26,041 --> 01:41:27,250
Not at all.

1476
01:41:34,916 --> 01:41:36,125
What are you doing here?

1477
01:41:36,625 --> 01:41:38,291
I just wanted to help.

1478
01:41:48,291 --> 01:41:50,666
Oh, this is called a Magic Sponge.

1479
01:41:52,166 --> 01:41:55,125

01:41:55,208 --> 01:41:57,625

1484
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:13,541
Be gentler.

1485
01:42:15,833 --> 01:42:17,125
Hi, Ali.

1486
01:42:17,208 --> 01:42:18,500
I-Jing.

1487
01:42:19,583 --> 01:42:21,166
You clean this one.

1488
01:42:22,875 --> 01:42:25,541
Are you ready?

1489
01:42:25,625 --> 01:42:27,125
Ready for what?

1490
01:42:27,208 --> 01:42:31,583
Ready for I-Jing's solo concert?

1491
01:42:31,666 --> 01:42:33,041
I-Jing's concert!

1492
01:42:36,416 --> 01:42:37,916
Mom, look!

1493
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:43,083
Applause and scream!

1494
01:42:43,166 --> 01:42:46,666
- Keep it down!
- A concert is supposed to be loud.

1495
01:42:46,750 --> 01:42:48,500
- It's embarrassing.
- Time to dance!

1496
01:42:49,750 --> 01:42:51,416
That's awesome!

1497
01:42:56,916 --> 01:42:58,458
Let me see your hands!

1498
01:43:01,250 --> 01:43:02,583
That's amazing!

1499
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:28,000

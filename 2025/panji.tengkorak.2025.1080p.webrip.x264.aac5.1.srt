1
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,130
<i>Have you heard?</i>

2
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,500
<i>Down south,
there's a rumor spreading around</i>

3
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:53,370
<i>about a powerful dark arts warrior.</i>

4
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,630
<i>They say he wiped out an entire village</i>

5
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:04,710
<i>by himself.</i>

6
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:11,370
<i>Slaughtering everyone without mercy.</i>

7
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,580
<i>No one knows where he came from.</i>

8
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,090
<i>Or his real name.</i>

9
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,050
<i>They call him the Devil from the South,</i>

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,380
<i>or better known as</i>

11
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,210
<i>Panji Tengkorak.</i>

12
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,420
Oh, Kuwuk, you still believe
in those stupid folk tales?

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,500
What folk tales?
I heard it from a local in the south.

14
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,090
A southerner who's full of crap.
Just like you!

15
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,460
Full of crap!

16
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,750
Hey, stay alert!

17
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,830
Let them be, Captain.

18
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,660
Joy is hard to come by these days.

19
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:13,040
People are too busy fighting each other.

20
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,130
So, what were you discussing?

21
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,130
It's...

22
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,040
Captain!

23
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,130
Kalawereng!

24
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,540
Everyone! Quickly...

25
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,250
Bandits!

26
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,960
Greetings, Lembugiri.

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,330
Thank you for bringing me
the item I needed.

28
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,910
Please, no!

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,330
You don't understand!

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,880
Indeed we do not understand

31
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:24,210
why you haven't used this thing
to end the war.

32
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,380
{\an8}THE KINGDOM OF MADYANTARA

33
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,620
{\an8}Well, Bajra? Any progress?

34
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:56,630
{\an8}Greetings, Commander.
We still haven't found him.

35
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:00,040
{\an8}But we ran into some bandits.

36
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:08,210
{\an8}Good. This will aid our cause.

37
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,120
{\an8}Yes, General.

38
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,870
{\an8}People of Madyantara!

39
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,040
{\an8}Behold, this is proof

40
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:21,130
that we have not abandoned you.

41
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:25,960
We can protect you better.

42
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,830
From both the bandits
as well as Aryadwipa.

43
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,130
For Madyantara!

44
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,080
My gold...

45
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,790
General.

46
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,960
We are happy to help
if you ever need us to.

47
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,420
We are honored to receive aid
from the Dewi Tari martial arts school.

48
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,010
Please come in.

49
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,210
Thank you.

50
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,880
What's the problem?

51
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:08,210
Only those assigned to patrol the forest
are allowed to come in here.

52
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,040
Leave before you get hurt, girl.

53
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,300
Get hurt?

54
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,250
Gantari.

55
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,210
Calm down, let us handle this.

56
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,910
Just wait here and guard the town.

57
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,210
Next.

58
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,000
Hey! Don't cut in!

59
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,410
Get in line!

60
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,920
- Take turns!
- This isn't enough. I want more!

61
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,790
Hey you!

62
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,840
I'm next!

63
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,630
- Move!
- I'm hungry too!

64
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,160
I've finally found you.

65
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,800
Greetings, I'm Bramantya.

66
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,000
I've been searching for you
for a long time.

67
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,210
It seems the incident on Serpent Island
had quite an effect on you.

68
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,210
Who are you?

69
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,830
How do you know about that?

70
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,960
I am an old friend
of your master, Nagamas.

71
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,660
I've been looking for you since
what happened at the fishing village.

72
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:02,000
Because you wander aimlessly,
I've had a hard time finding you.

73
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,380
Spare me the small talk.
What do you want from me?

74
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,500
I don't want the Serpent Island tragedy
to repeat itself.

75
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,830
Your master and I have a brother-in-arms.

76
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,330
<i>His name is Lembugiri.</i>

77
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:21,670
<i>He sent me a vision that he was attacked
by the mountain bandit,</i>

78
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,120
<i>Kalawereng.</i>

79
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,630
That's why I'm looking for you.

80
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,540
I know what you're capable of,
and I need your help to find him.

81
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,420
I don't want to lose another brother.

82
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,790
Hey, wait!

83
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,460
Panji!

84
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,370
Listen to me.
There's a reason why you need to--

85
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,170
That's how I defeated those bandits.

86
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,040
You see how great I am?

87
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:57,130
- Mister, please have a taste.
- Have a drink.

88
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,090
It's okay, I'm good.

89
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,500
What happened next?

90
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:05,710
Unfortunately, I fell into a ravine
and got separated from the group.

91
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:11,170
If I hadn't, they would've
arrived here safely.

92
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,750
Had you come sooner, we wouldn't need
the kingdom's protection.

93
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,960
She's right.

94
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,710
I can't say I'll defeat all the bandits.

95
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:25,830
But at least, I wouldn't extort you.

96
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,710
Just so you know,
the bandit head they displayed

97
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:38,040
isn't the mountain bandit
who's been terrorizing the town.

98
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:42,010
Are you saying Commander Wirabaya lied?

99
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:47,210
{\an8}I'm not saying he lied, but...

100
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,420
But what, huh?

101
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,920
Crap! I'm done for.

102
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,040
You caused a scene
and still have the nerve to boast?

103
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,910
Hey! What's your problem?

104
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,550
It was just a story,
he didn't mean any harm!

105
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,210
Step aside, little girl!

106
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,130
This is between men!

107
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,050
{\an8}You insolent brat!

108
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,510
Arrest them!

109
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,790
Come here!

110
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,670
Hey!

111
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,080
Excuse me.

112
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,250
Stop running away!

113
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,210
Let me get a few hits.

114
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,620
Hey, wait.

115
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,590
Aren't you going to help them?

116
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,210
I have no business with them.

117
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:40,300
If you think I'll help you
in searching for your brother,

118
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,170
forget it.

119
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,380
I'm not interested.

120
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,000
Like it or not,

121
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,910
he's still your master's brother!

122
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,620
I don't know him.

123
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,880
Come back here!

124
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,500
There's more to why
I'm asking you to join me.

125
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,790
Lembugiri has the talisman
that could lift the curse within you.

126
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,290
Indeed.

127
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,710
I know what's inside you.

128
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,550
You know the cure?

129
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,760
Yes.

130
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,830
It's a relic that my brother,
Lembugiri, was carrying.

131
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:35,750
<i>The truth is, my brother fled his temple
to prevent that relic</i>

132
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,670
<i>from falling into Aryadwipa's hands.</i>

133
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,420
But it's now in the hands
of the mountain bandits.

134
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,090
Help me retrieve it.

135
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:52,710
Once we do, you can use it
to lift your curse.

136
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,130
I won't force you.

137
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,040
The decision is in your hands.

138
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,550
Stop!

139
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,080
What are you doing, fighting in public?

140
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,550
You! Come with me.

141
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,590
What's going on?

142
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,750
Have you forgotten your manners?

143
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,040
My apologies, Commander.
This all started because of that girl...

144
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,170
I don't want to hear it.

145
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,000
We should set a good example
for the people,

146
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,960
not brawl in public.

147
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,460
Get yourselves ready.

148
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,420
You're joining Bajra
to search the forest for Lembugiri.

149
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,080
Yes, Commander.

150
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,960
Hey, ready to go?

151
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,500
Let's go.

152
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,790
Wait for me, Murni.

153
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,250
We'll be back together soon.

154
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,290
{\an8}WANAGETIH TEMPLE

155
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,920
Attention, everyone!

156
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,630
For a long time,
we've had to loot and steal

157
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:14,630
because circumstances left us no choice.

158
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:20,580
But that time is coming to an end!

159
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:28,670
All thanks to the relic in this chest.

160
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:36,800
Now it's our turn to rise,

161
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:43,210
and those damned kings
will kneel before us!

162
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:04,580
Is it true that this relic can make me
the king of Madyantara?

163
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:08,160
Not just Madyantara,

164
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,920
you could become
the king of the entire country.

165
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,580
Only after this chest is opened.

166
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,540
But no matter how hard I try,

167
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,710
the chest won't open.

168
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,170
The chest requires
three special keys to open.

169
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,040
But worry not,

170
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,420
{\an8}I have a feeling the other two keys
are close.

171
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,540
<i>Panji.</i>

172
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,290
<i>Panji!</i>

173
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,210
Murni.

174
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,760
Where are you, Murni?

175
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:53,910
<i>Panji!</i>

176
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,380
<i>Panji.</i>

177
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,000
<i>Panji!</i>

178
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,210
<i>Panji.</i>

179
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,260
<i>I'm over here.</i>

180
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,420
<i>Panji!</i>

181
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,000
<i>Panji!</i>

182
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,750
<i>Panji!</i>

183
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:32,870
<i>Panji!</i>

184
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,380
<i>Panji!</i>

185
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,710
<i>Panji!</i>

186
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,330
<i>Panji!</i>

187
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,420
<i>Panji!</i>

188
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,080
<i>Panji!</i>

189
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,130
Panji!

190
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:02,920
Panji!

191
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,050
Are you all right?

192
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,670
You went quiet all of a sudden.

193
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,330
Just thinking of a way
to locate Lembugiri.

194
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,750
There's no way we can cover
this entire forest.

195
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,370
What is it?

196
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,760
Fix your cart at once!

197
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,250
We're way behind the group.

198
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,160
Yes.

199
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,170
But the load is too heavy.

200
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,670
Just take this!

201
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,250
Stop. This is our chance.

202
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,460
You're going to ignore them?

203
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,340
This can lead us straight to Lembugiri.

204
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:12,250
You're letting them run rampant?

205
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,160
Yes.

206
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,630
Don't hurt us!

207
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:27,580
Someone's playing the hero!

208
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,760
Mom!

209
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,460
Hey!

210
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:47,160
This is none of your business, sweetheart.

211
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,500
How about you have fun with us instead?

212
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,750
You're asking for it.

213
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,210
Go!

214
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,260
Is that all you've got?

215
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:06,710
Come at me!

216
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,120
Where are you going?

217
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:38,910
No!

218
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,830
Who's there?

219
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,120
It's you!

220
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,500
Stop! We're all on the same side.

221
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,170
What do you mean?

222
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:59,670
From your moves, I can tell
that you're a student of Dewi Tari.

223
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,090
How did you...

224
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:07,000
My name is Bramantya,
from the Iron Fist school.

225
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,790
Pardon my impudence.

226
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,830
I didn't expect to meet
a legendary warrior such as you.

227
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,870
I'm Gantari, disciple of Dewi Tari.

228
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,630
My master often speaks of you.

229
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,750
Just call me uncle.

230
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:24,050
Your master must've sent you
to look for Lembugiri.

231
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,620
Is that right?

232
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:28,380
I was heading to where
Master Lembugiri was attacked

233
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,590
when I heard a call for help.

234
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,960
If you've got your own mission,

235
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,420
you shouldn't be playing the hero.

236
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:41,590
You're nothing but a heartless
dark arts warrior!

237
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:45,250
Enough. Please pardon
my companion's rudeness.

238
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,250
{\an8}If I may ask,

239
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,420
{\an8}you mentioned knowing the location
of Lembugiri's attack?

240
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,000
Yes.

241
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,620
My friend knows
where the attack took place.

242
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,340
Kuwuk!

243
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,550
You took them all out?
Guess my powers weren't needed.

244
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:14,260
Stop showing off, Kuwuk. Get over here.

245
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,330
Okay.

246
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,920
Uncle.

247
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:23,290
He's the only member of Lembugiri's party
who survived Kalawereng's ambush.

248
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,710
He promised to take me to the crime scene.

249
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,580
Right. I know where it is.

250
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:31,880
I rescued him from the Madyantara troops.

251
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,790
He owes me his life.

252
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,170
Let's keep that part under wraps, okay?

253
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:40,830
You're welcome to come with us
if you'd like.

254
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:44,160
After we get them to safety, of course.

255
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,630
If it's not too much trouble,

256
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:51,920
I'll accept your offer.

257
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,410
Yes, Uncle.

258
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,790
{\an8}So they're coming with us?

259
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,130
{\an8}Just so you know,

260
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:04,500
{\an8}I threw the fight
at the tavern on purpose.

261
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:08,460
After all, the soldiers of Madyantara
wouldn't want to lose face

262
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,420
in front of their people, would they?

263
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,460
They're huge and strong,

264
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:17,000
they'd hate losing to a small fry like me.

265
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,870
You received a vision from Lembugiri?

266
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,790
Yes, I secluded myself
from the outside world for several years.

267
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,710
That was the only way he could reach me.

268
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,630
I didn't know Master Lembugiri
could send visions.

269
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:38,370
There's a lot you don't know about him.

270
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,000
But I don't get it.

271
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,710
Why did the bandits ambush
Lembugiri's group?

272
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:47,250
I'm just as confused.
Why would they be so reckless?

273
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,290
...why I got separated.

274
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,960
During the attack, I didn't run away.

275
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,170
I was just hiding.

276
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:58,750
Then I fell into the ravine. That's why...

277
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,580
Thought it was a tiger.

278
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,130
What are you really after?

279
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,540
You're keeping the relic a secret
from that girl.

280
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,630
What's so special about it?

281
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:03,500
{\an8}No one is supposed to know
about that relic.

282
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,540
{\an8}Because it's no ordinary relic.

283
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:12,590
<i>Our country's been at war
with Aryadwipa for a long time.</i>

284
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:24,630
<i>We've fought for years to defend our land.</i>

285
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:32,130
<i>Yet, the conflict seems never-ending.</i>

286
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:40,880
<i>We began to realize
that the war would never end.</i>

287
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,170
<i>As the fighting drags on,</i>

288
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:50,130
<i>more lives will be wasted in vain.</i>

289
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,790
<i>Our goal is to end the war with Aryadwipa.</i>

290
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,920
<i>To do that, we're trying to find
the Adidaya relic,</i>

291
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:09,050
<i>the relic believed to have helped
the first king unite the entire realm.</i>

292
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:15,580
<i>With the relic,
we hope to unite both kingdoms.</i>

293
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,210
<i>However...</i>

294
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:34,080
<i>The power of that relic is too great</i>

295
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:35,630
<i>for any mortal to wield.</i>

296
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:39,120
So, we decided to seal the relic

297
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:42,460
and split its keys into three parts.

298
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,250
{\an8}After that,
we kept its existence a secret,

299
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,750
{\an8}ensuring that no one
would ever know about it.

300
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:52,750
{\an8}What's the reason for telling me all this?

301
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,540
Not only did you break your oath,

302
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,910
you'd even let me use the relic.

303
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:05,050
You're Nagamas's disciple, after all.

304
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,250
{\an8}Despite his temper and madness,
he's always true to his promises.

305
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,710
{\an8}I believe he wants you to carry on
his oath to protect the relic.

306
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,960
I am not my master.

307
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:24,120
His oaths are not mine!

308
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,660
But

309
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:33,590
as long as I can use that relic
to lift my curse...

310
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,260
I will help you.

311
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,920
Good job!

312
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,340
Help!

313
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,000
Stop!

314
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:15,790
You guys got quite a catch.

315
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,500
So you're the leader of these bastards?

316
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,500
The cowardly general of Madyantara,

317
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,960
who betrayed his country

318
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,670
to save his own skin!

319
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,750
Listen up, Bajra.

320
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,420
You're mistaken.

321
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,670
I didn't escape,

322
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:54,710
I was... enlightened.

323
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:00,210
I can explain it if you--

324
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:03,250
Who'd bother listening
to a coward like you?

325
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,960
{\an8}Let's settle this one-on-one!

326
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:14,750
Pick it up!

327
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:18,460
I accept your challenge.

328
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:23,540
Let's do this!

329
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:40,800
What's wrong?

330
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:44,210
Don't tell me the bandit life
has made you soft.

331
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:04,120
What about now? You ready to listen?

332
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:06,500
Never!

333
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,750
You fool!

334
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:16,540
{\an8}Don't you realize you're nothing
but a dog to them?

335
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:26,380
Listen up, my brothers.

336
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:31,250
I'm giving you two options.

337
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:36,370
Join me in overthrowing the kingdom

338
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:40,040
that has tormented you,

339
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,370
or...

340
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:49,460
end up like your leader here!

341
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,830
Allow me.

342
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,840
You oppose us
because you don't understand us.

343
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,460
Let me help you understand.

344
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,120
{\an8}Beautiful.

345
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,210
{\an8}How beautiful.

346
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,410
Please, allow me to join you.

347
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,420
I want to help you
make your dream a reality.

348
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:45,790
When is that key going to show up?

349
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:47,790
Be patient.

350
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,000
He'll be here soon.

351
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:54,550
I'm sick of waiting!

352
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,580
It looks like we'll have to go around...

353
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,870
Hey, wait for me!

354
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:05,050
Gosh.

355
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:07,550
{\an8}Hey! Why are you in such a hurry?

356
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:09,960
{\an8}Kuwuk's struggling to keep up.

357
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,790
{\an8}Don't you feel sorry for him?

358
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,510
Do you?

359
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:16,550
Then go help him.

360
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,830
Gosh.

361
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,460
Easy, Uncle.

362
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:43,460
That's weird.

363
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,460
I don't see any dead bodies.

364
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,960
I think I know why.

365
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,510
Lembugiri.

366
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:21,210
Those bastards!

367
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,380
The Earth-Splitting strike!

368
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:31,290
Uncle, wait!

369
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,620
Kuwuk, help me out!

370
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,000
Don't let him wreck this place!

371
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,790
You should help too! Hurry!

372
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,010
Just let him throw his tantrum.

373
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,710
He'll come to see it's all in vain.

374
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,050
What did you say?

375
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,960
You think you understand how I feel?

376
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,920
No, I don't understand
and I don't want to.

377
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:15,130
But I know what happens
when rage takes over.

378
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,040
This is bad.

379
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,290
- Uncle!
- Hang in there, Uncle!

380
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,550
Calm down, Uncle.

381
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,340
Hang in there.

382
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,790
{\an8}Panji is right.

383
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,340
I should have stayed calm.

384
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,080
I'm sorry.

385
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,750
Show some empathy, will you?

386
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:59,210
He just lost his brother!

387
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:00,960
Woman.

388
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:04,550
Grief only clouds our focus.

389
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,170
We must stay alert.

390
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:12,210
We don't know why they set up this pile...

391
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:17,170
Kuwuk, hide!

392
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:19,040
Where?

393
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,550
Under the bodies! Hurry!

394
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,580
Panji! Go help her!

395
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:45,630
I'll deal with these guys.

396
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,250
What are you doing here?

397
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,830
The old man asked me to helped you.

398
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,590
He'll take care of the rascals over there.

399
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,670
For the record,

400
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:01,000
I don't need your help.

401
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,790
Yeah. I believe you.

402
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,710
Well, well, well.

403
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:42,840
Would you look at that, the bait worked.

404
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:53,330
Take it easy.

405
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:57,750
I just want to have a chat.

406
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:00,670
I know what you're capable of.

407
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:09,420
Especially you, Tengkorak.

408
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:13,040
I want you two to join me.

409
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,580
I don't care about your plans.

410
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,080
I'm here to take that relic.

411
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,370
This one's mine!

412
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,040
You guys deal with the girl!

413
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:31,130
- After her!
- Come on!

414
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:50,420
Why did you stop?

415
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,040
Eldest brother.

416
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,330
Take this!

417
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,750
Come!

418
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:07,960
Who's there?

419
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,460
Behind you.

420
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:13,670
I've been waiting for you.

421
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,750
Uncle.

422
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,750
Brother, snap out of it!

423
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:51,210
They've brainwashed you!

424
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,590
No, Gantari. They've revealed the truth.

425
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:02,300
We are the ones who were led astray.

426
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:05,260
Join us. I'll guide you to the right path.

427
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:06,580
No!

428
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:10,620
I would never side with the dark arts!

429
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,290
Very well.

430
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:15,590
You've made your choice.

431
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,380
Murni!

432
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,960
Panji.

433
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,920
Panji.

434
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:35,160
Panji.

435
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,670
You said you were going to train.

436
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:43,000
But all I see is you lying around.

437
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,750
I rested here after training,
waiting for you.

438
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:50,410
Are you sure?

439
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,750
Enough with the excuses.

440
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,160
Come on.

441
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:08,630
Hello, sir, ma'am.

442
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,710
Hello, Murni.

443
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:12,870
Going out for a walk?

444
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,670
Let's play.

445
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,500
Join us, Panji.

446
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,920
What a great catch!

447
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:29,800
We were in luck.

448
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,590
Thank you, Panji.

449
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:33,960
Panji! Help us out too.

450
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,580
I can give you a hand.

451
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:37,670
This one.

452
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:40,250
You're so strong.

453
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:43,250
I need your help too.

454
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:44,790
Come with me, Panji.

455
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:47,620
Excuse me.

456
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,540
It's beautiful, isn't it?

457
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,920
I have a gift for you.

458
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,830
Really?

459
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,790
Let me guess,

460
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:16,170
you hid it in that tree again?

461
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,040
How'd you know?

462
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,130
Wait, let me get it for you.

463
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:32,460
Your headband was worn out,
so I made you a new one.

464
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:40,580
Murni.

465
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:42,000
Yes?

466
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:47,580
I've decided,
I don't want to be a warrior.

467
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,460
{\an8}But why?

468
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:55,500
{\an8}You've been training so hard
with Master Nagamas

469
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,960
to become the greatest warrior.

470
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,380
I'd rather live a simple life with you.

471
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,290
Panji.

472
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,920
{\an8}I'm so glad to hear that.

473
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,840
{\an8}Panji, look.

474
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,920
- Murni.
- Yes?

475
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:26,540
Tell all the villagers to evacuate.

476
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:29,340
Panji! Where are you going?

477
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,380
I have to inform Master Nagamas.

478
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,460
You go on ahead,

479
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,260
I'll be right behind you.

480
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:37,160
Panji.

481
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:38,960
Go now!

482
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,750
Warn the villagers!

483
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,670
Run for your lives!

484
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:50,630
Evacuate now!
Leave your belongings! Hurry!

485
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:58,250
Kill them!

486
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,630
Master! The Yellow Pirates
are invading our island!

487
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,170
We have to do something!

488
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:16,260
Let them come.

489
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:21,090
I expected their arrival.

490
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:31,330
Get out of here

491
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,290
and take those items with you.

492
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:37,710
What do you mean?
Are you facing them alone?

493
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:39,080
I want to help!

494
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:42,830
You fool!

495
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:53,040
This is my fight, boy!

496
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:55,590
You stay out of it!

497
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:56,670
But, Master...

498
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:59,290
If you want to help,

499
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,540
then do as I say!

500
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:04,710
Yes, Master.

501
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,790
Get off this island with those items!

502
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,790
Help!

503
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:19,160
Everyone, move!

504
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:23,330
Where are you going, lady?

505
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:26,370
{\an8}Panji!

506
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,080
{\an8}Where's Master?

507
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:33,330
He... told us to leave.

508
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,710
It's okay, Panji.

509
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,210
He's a mighty warrior.

510
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,870
If he told you to leave,

511
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:42,880
then he can handle this by himself.

512
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,580
Come on, people have set up boats
on the other side of the cliff.

513
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,080
What's wrong?

514
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:51,960
I'm sorry, Murni.

515
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,710
I can't leave him like this.

516
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:56,250
{\an8}Panji?

517
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:57,540
Keep this book safe.

518
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:01,210
I promise I will come back to you.

519
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:02,750
Panji. Panji!

520
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:04,080
Go now!

521
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:24,260
What do you want?

522
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:27,380
Get out of our village!

523
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:51,080
Panji!

524
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:53,330
Murni!

525
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:54,550
Panji!

526
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:55,460
{\an8}Murni!

527
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:57,460
What do you want?

528
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:58,370
Murni!

529
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:01,420
Run! Stop it!

530
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:02,920
Murni!

531
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,630
- Come here!
- No!

532
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:08,960
- Don't run! Come here!
- Panji!

533
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:26,540
Murni.

534
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:32,120
Murni!

535
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:36,710
Murni!

536
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:45,250
Murni!

537
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:47,500
Murni!

538
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:49,670
Wake up, Murni!

539
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:56,750
Murni, please! Wake up!

540
00:45:58,250 --> 00:45:59,710
I'm so sorry.

541
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:02,580
Murni!

542
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:06,250
Wake up, Murni.

543
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:08,080
Murni!

544
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:11,250
Murni!

545
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:34,960
Hang in there, Murni.

546
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:37,800
I'm here to help.

547
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:01,120
What's this?

548
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:03,630
What should I do?

549
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:14,590
<i>They call him the Devil from the South.</i>

550
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:37,590
If you're back on your feet,
go back to town.

551
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:40,460
Leave Kalawereng to me.

552
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:42,620
{\an8}You're underestimating me.

553
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:47,460
{\an8}Don't worry, I can handle myself.

554
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:48,750
{\an8}Are you out of your mind?

555
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:51,170
{\an8}You could get yourself killed!

556
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,590
Call me whatever you want.

557
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,260
But I won't turn my back on you.

558
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:03,330
{\an8}At least let me help you.

559
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:07,460
As a knight, I've sworn

560
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:10,630
to repay those who save me.

561
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,330
Suit yourself.

562
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:18,170
But that naive vow
will get you killed one day.

563
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:19,080
I know.

564
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:21,420
I accept that risk.

565
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,330
What's the meaning of this? Let me go!

566
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,010
Long time no see...

567
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:47,500
My brother.

568
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:51,370
It's a pity

569
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:56,910
that our long-awaited reunion
had to happen like this.

570
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:00,420
You...

571
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:04,290
you faked your death to lure me out?

572
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:07,210
What is this nonsense?

573
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:11,290
Lembugiri, have you forgotten our oath?

574
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:14,790
That relic is too dangerous to use.

575
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:19,130
{\an8}I knew you wouldn't listen to me.

576
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,840
{\an8}Here, let me show you.

577
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:38,960
Kalawereng! Kalawereng!

578
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:43,670
Hey, Lembu!

579
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:45,920
You want to make him

580
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:48,050
the one and only king?

581
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:49,500
Is that it?

582
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:53,670
You can't possibly
believe all this, can you?

583
00:49:56,210 --> 00:50:00,040
{\an8}Once a general betrayed by his own king,

584
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:03,260
he is destined to be a king
devoted to his people.

585
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:07,080
He'll be no different than any other king

586
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:10,170
once he tastes the power of the throne.

587
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:12,840
Hold it.

588
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,340
We still need the location of the key.

589
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:18,370
I know.

590
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:21,920
But he's not going to tell us willingly.

591
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,830
Let me handle this my way.

592
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:39,580
Gosh. Why is it so quiet?

593
00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:46,210
Please don't kill me, don't skin me alive.
I still have a lot to live for!

594
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:47,830
Kuwuk?

595
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:50,590
Gantari! Panji!

596
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:52,210
Where's Uncle Bramantya?

597
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:53,870
Well...

598
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,380
Kalawereng captured him.

599
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:58,590
Kalawereng.

600
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,380
I swear, I didn't mean to leave him.

601
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:07,790
But you know there were so many of them.

602
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:09,550
Where did they go?

603
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,630
To the east.

604
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:15,290
The forbidden forest, Wanagetih.

605
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,420
You're really going there?

606
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:20,460
We have no choice,

607
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:22,250
we have to save him.

608
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:24,630
Go back to town.

609
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:27,090
You'll only slow us down.

610
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:34,630
Hey, wait!

611
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:38,290
Here, you dropped this.

612
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:58,120
Panji.

613
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:03,960
You promised we'd never be apart again.

614
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,380
Yes, Murni. I promise.

615
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:10,170
Then, why did you leave me?

616
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:18,260
It's true. I'm serious.

617
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:20,920
He's carrying a skull in his bag.

618
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:24,130
I think he really is Panji Tengkorak!

619
00:52:26,830 --> 00:52:28,210
You're leaving?

620
00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:46,330
I'm not sure of the difference between
dark arts and white magic anymore.

621
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,960
It thought it was a label for evil

622
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,080
and good warriors.

623
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:57,460
But in reality, it's not that simple.

624
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:01,830
My brother joined the bandits.

625
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:03,500
But you, Panji,

626
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,840
a dark arts warrior, saved my life.

627
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:13,300
I despise the dark arts

628
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:16,920
because a warrior used it
to slaughter my family.

629
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:20,410
He let me live

630
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:23,630
only to watch me suffer
in this dark world.

631
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:27,870
But then my master saved me.

632
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:32,460
She pulled me from that void,

633
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:37,130
and that's when I decided
to become a warrior

634
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:39,920
to help others escape that same void.

635
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:44,750
I understand the void you feel.

636
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:49,170
Your guilt, your anger.

637
00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:52,830
I've felt it too.

638
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,330
I can help you.

639
00:53:58,290 --> 00:54:00,460
But only if you let me.

640
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:07,040
I want to know the truth
behind the rumors.

641
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,710
I want to know why you chose
to become Panji Tengkorak.

642
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:15,660
If I tell you my story,

643
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,710
will you leave me alone?

644
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:35,170
<i>What Kuwuk said is true.</i>

645
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,500
I'm sorry, Murni.

646
00:54:58,250 --> 00:54:59,830
This is all my fault.

647
00:55:03,330 --> 00:55:04,370
I'm so sorry.

648
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:12,420
Panji.

649
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:14,160
Murni?

650
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:16,960
Murni?

651
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:19,340
Where are you?

652
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:21,300
Panji.

653
00:55:22,330 --> 00:55:23,160
Murni.

654
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:25,080
I'm here.

655
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:27,410
Murni.

656
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:31,590
I'm over here.

657
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40,620
I'm here, Panji.

658
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:55,960
I was such an idiot!

659
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:59,410
Why did things turn out this way?

660
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:04,000
I should've stayed with you, Murni.

661
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:18,040
If only I had listened to her,

662
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:22,300
she would still...

663
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:25,210
No!

664
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,630
This is not my fault.

665
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:33,920
Murni shouldn't have died.

666
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:41,580
Murni.

667
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:46,960
You weren't supposed to end up like this.

668
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:50,160
It's all their fault!

669
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,760
I swear,

670
00:56:56,210 --> 00:56:58,840
{\an8}I will avenge you.

671
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:02,800
{\an8}I won't stop

672
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:07,250
until every last one of them is wiped out.

673
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,760
Watch closely, Murni.

674
00:57:13,790 --> 00:57:16,040
You shall be the witness

675
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:19,170
to my vengeance.

676
00:58:11,330 --> 00:58:13,250
It's over, Murni.

677
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:16,960
Justice has been served.

678
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:20,960
Now we can be together again.

679
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:28,710
Nothing will ever separate us.

680
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,500
What's wrong with me?

681
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:52,040
In the end, white and dark arts
are the same.

682
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:55,420
They're both meant to take lives.

683
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:59,580
And now, I've been cursed by it.

684
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:02,910
I was cursed to keep living,

685
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:09,410
for using my beloved to justify
the atrocities I committed.

686
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:15,630
If you really regret your actions,

687
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,040
why don't you try redeeming yourself?

688
01:00:20,330 --> 01:00:21,290
Redeeming myself?

689
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,290
How?

690
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:28,750
Taking lives is all I know.

691
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:31,290
You are Panji Tengkorak.

692
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:34,790
The undefeated warrior.

693
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:40,090
You could use that power
to help those in need.

694
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:45,290
I'm sure that's what Murni
would want you to do.

695
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:48,540
No. That's enough.

696
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,760
I've told you my story.

697
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:53,420
Now go.

698
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:55,840
Leave me alone.

699
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:05,880
- What is this?
- Excuse us.

700
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:11,000
{\an8}Whoever dares to step foot on Wanagetih

701
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:17,460
will face a terrifying death
at the hands of the gods.

702
01:01:20,830 --> 01:01:22,710
I don't think we're supposed to...

703
01:01:23,790 --> 01:01:25,920
They left me again?

704
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,460
Excuse me. We're just passing through.

705
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,420
What a madman!

706
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:42,840
Who would've thought

707
01:01:43,630 --> 01:01:48,260
he'd hide the key inside his own body?

708
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,000
See? I told you

709
01:01:57,710 --> 01:02:00,710
he always keeps important things on him.

710
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:05,380
The question is,

711
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:08,710
where did he hide the last key?

712
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:16,040
No matter how much you tear my body apart,

713
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,760
you will never find it!

714
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:28,380
Nagamas took the key with him to hell.

715
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:34,710
This must be it.

716
01:02:36,330 --> 01:02:38,370
How do we get in?

717
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,260
{\an8}You two stay here.

718
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:45,460
I'm coming with you, Panji.

719
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:48,880
You won't be on your own this time.

720
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:52,380
No need. I won't be alone.

721
01:03:23,630 --> 01:03:24,460
Fire!

722
01:03:25,830 --> 01:03:29,000
Fire! Wake up!

723
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:33,080
- Everyone, get up! There's a fire!
- Open up!

724
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:42,090
Stop the fire!

725
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:43,920
Intruder!

726
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,920
Unbelievable!

727
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,460
Who dares to mess with my kingdom?

728
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:55,420
Show yourself, coward!

729
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:00,960
You!

730
01:04:05,290 --> 01:04:06,460
That sword...

731
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:08,330
No!

732
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:10,920
There's no way he's Nagamas' disciple!

733
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:20,250
Come and fight me!

734
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:24,420
Stop running like a coward!

735
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,210
Fine. You asked for it.

736
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:45,840
There's no doubt,
those are Nagamas's moves.

737
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,090
{\an8}But why did he destroy our base?

738
01:04:57,210 --> 01:05:01,250
Nagamas's moves shouldn't give
the enemy an opening.

739
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:04,080
So why did he let Kalawereng strike?

740
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:05,920
It's as if...

741
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:10,670
I won't be alone.

742
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:13,460
I'll need your help.

743
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:18,380
Quiet, Kuwuk.

744
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:19,340
Okay.

745
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:23,380
<i>They're probably keeping Bramantya
in their tent.</i>

746
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:24,340
Intruder!

747
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:30,370
<i>I'll create a distraction
to lure them out,</i>

748
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:32,830
<i>drawing them as far away as possible</i>

749
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:38,040
<i>so you can sneak in and rescue Bramantya.</i>

750
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:39,920
Lembugiri!

751
01:05:44,790 --> 01:05:46,420
Impressive!

752
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:50,000
I never saw your plan coming.

753
01:05:52,710 --> 01:05:54,920
But you don't understand!

754
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:57,580
You're on the wrong side!

755
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:05,750
<i>It all started here.</i>

756
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:10,130
<i>The three of us
who discovered the Adidaya relic</i>

757
01:06:10,210 --> 01:06:13,170
<i>initially swore not to use it.</i>

758
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:18,920
<i>But over time, our resolve began to waver.</i>

759
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:25,040
{\an8}<i>Your master secretly
studied the dark arts.</i>

760
01:06:26,210 --> 01:06:29,880
<i>We suspect he studied that art
to take control of the relic.</i>

761
01:06:31,790 --> 01:06:33,540
This is my business!

762
01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:35,050
Why are you studying that?

763
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:37,090
<i>We tried speaking with your master,</i>

764
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:40,040
<i>but it ended in an argument.</i>

765
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,630
<i>We asked him to stop
studying the dark arts,</i>

766
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:49,050
<i>but he refused and went his own way.</i>

767
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:55,710
<i>Out of fear that your master
would claim the relic,</i>

768
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,630
<i>one of us acted to prevent it.</i>

769
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:04,870
<i>By silencing him for life.</i>

770
01:07:12,630 --> 01:07:14,210
Don't you see?

771
01:07:15,290 --> 01:07:19,370
Isn't his technique too similar to
the mysterious figure on Serpent Island?

772
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:21,380
Yes!

773
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:26,080
He's the one who sided
with the Yellow Pirates!

774
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,790
{\an8}He's the one who ruined your life!

775
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:32,630
That's right.

776
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:36,040
Don't spare his life.

777
01:07:37,210 --> 01:07:38,170
Kill him!

778
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:42,170
A life for a life!

779
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,380
I'll deal with him

780
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:53,410
after the relic is in my hands.

781
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:23,500
I was surprised to see a young man
fighting with Nagamas' technique.

782
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,040
So it was you who brought him.

783
01:08:26,130 --> 01:08:27,050
However...

784
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:31,840
Your moves are predictable, Bramantya.

785
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,250
You always carry
something important with you.

786
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:10,840
Don't tell me, all this time...

787
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:15,250
You think I'd let a dog like you
claim that relic?

788
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:19,290
It's for the chosen ones alone!

789
01:09:44,210 --> 01:09:45,040
Uncle.

790
01:09:47,710 --> 01:09:48,540
Thank you.

791
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:52,300
Kalawereng has been killed!

792
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:53,920
Kalawereng is dead!

793
01:10:10,130 --> 01:10:11,510
What do I do?

794
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:15,380
Bullseye!

795
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,130
I'm a natural.

796
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:48,170
They just keep on coming!

797
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:50,870
Leave this to me!

798
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:52,880
- Cover me.
- Got it.

799
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:06,000
Let's go! We don't have much time!

800
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,500
Let's go, Kuwuk!

801
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:08,620
Wait for me!

802
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:19,960
I'll offer you this one last time.

803
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:24,040
Join me in uniting the world.

804
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:28,550
Only then, we can achieve true peace.

805
01:11:29,750 --> 01:11:30,880
{\an8}How ironic.

806
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:34,250
{\an8}Killing hundreds to achieve peace?

807
01:11:53,670 --> 01:11:55,880
He's fused with the power of the relic.

808
01:11:56,540 --> 01:11:58,620
It's going to be a tough fight.

809
01:11:59,210 --> 01:12:00,670
You two, get out of here.

810
01:12:01,790 --> 01:12:03,710
Let Bramantya and I handle this.

811
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,880
You want to play games?

812
01:12:20,710 --> 01:12:23,380
Fine, I'll play along.

813
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:33,210
Is that all you've got?

814
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:41,550
- You!
- I told you I'd help you!

815
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,590
Playtime's over.

816
01:13:18,630 --> 01:13:21,010
This ends now.

817
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:25,510
Panji!

818
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:57,750
My brethren!

819
01:13:59,290 --> 01:14:05,250
All of you have been chosen
to witness this power.

820
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:09,460
The time has come.

821
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:16,130
With this power,
we will end all suffering.

822
01:14:37,290 --> 01:14:39,830
We're under attack!

823
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:43,410
Secure the gate! Quickly!

824
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:45,290
Run for your lives!

825
01:14:48,540 --> 01:14:50,870
Everyone, calm down!

826
01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:53,330
Soldiers, set up the barricades!

827
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:56,630
Block them at the entrance!

828
01:14:56,710 --> 01:14:57,540
Yes, sir!

829
01:15:01,670 --> 01:15:03,250
Gather the citizens in one place.

830
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:06,800
Don't let anyone escape.

831
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:10,090
The people of Madyantara
stand their ground.

832
01:15:10,830 --> 01:15:12,000
Yes, Commander.

833
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:51,000
Gantari.

834
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:53,160
Gantari, wake up. Gantari!

835
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:54,750
Gantari!

836
01:15:57,670 --> 01:16:02,170
Lembugiri showed you what happened
on Serpent Island, didn't he?

837
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:06,540
{\an8}I want you to know.

838
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:10,380
{\an8}I deeply regret what happened.

839
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:15,960
<i>I admit,</i>

840
01:16:17,330 --> 01:16:20,500
<i>I let my emotions get the best of me
when I confronted him.</i>

841
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,290
Do you understand, Bramantya?

842
01:16:33,210 --> 01:16:36,790
I didn't do all this

843
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:40,840
to control the Adidaya relic!

844
01:16:45,580 --> 01:16:51,000
Nothing can exist on its own.

845
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:56,670
{\an8}Everything needs a counterbalance.

846
01:16:57,630 --> 01:17:02,050
Even if I have to study the dark arts...

847
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:06,260
I'll do it,

848
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:13,880
if that's what it takes
to stop the relic, Bramantya!

849
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:16,410
Enough nonsense, Nagamas!

850
01:17:18,750 --> 01:17:20,380
Give me the relic key now

851
01:17:21,290 --> 01:17:23,330
and no one will get hurt.

852
01:17:24,580 --> 01:17:26,620
No one will get hurt?

853
01:17:33,630 --> 01:17:38,510
Can't you see what you've done
to this island?

854
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:42,170
Even from here,

855
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:46,540
I can smell the stench

856
01:17:46,630 --> 01:17:50,090
of innocent people's blood, Bramantya!

857
01:17:54,210 --> 01:17:55,250
My face!

858
01:17:55,330 --> 01:17:57,540
Damn you! Kill him!

859
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:12,710
You're doomed, Bramantya!

860
01:18:14,710 --> 01:18:19,500
Now, I'll take the key with me to hell!

861
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:27,080
Follow me if you want it!

862
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:33,580
<i>I regret what I did
after everything turned to ashes.</i>

863
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:40,000
<i>That's why I chose to exile myself.</i>

864
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:50,210
I'm sharing this because you are
one of my deepest regrets.

865
01:18:51,290 --> 01:18:54,210
I brought you on purpose
so that after it's all over,

866
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:56,910
I can tell you everything

867
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
and let you end my life.

868
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:04,300
{\an8}But right now, I have to stop Lembugiri.

869
01:19:06,210 --> 01:19:08,250
Once this is over, I promise

870
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:10,960
I'll surrender my life to you.

871
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:17,420
I will kill you!

872
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,330
But before that,

873
01:19:22,210 --> 01:19:25,040
I'll make sure you don't get killed.

874
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:31,330
Kuwuk.

875
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:34,250
- Look after Gantari.
- Okay.

876
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:44,790
How dare you come down here!

877
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:47,300
Are you asking for death?

878
01:19:47,380 --> 01:19:50,340
We are not here to ask for death.

879
01:19:50,420 --> 01:19:53,250
We are here to stop the war.

880
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:55,910
What's happening? Why, Master?

881
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,130
Let us through, Commander.

882
01:19:58,830 --> 01:20:02,620
All we want is to settle the score
with the king of Madyantara.

883
01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:06,040
You are welcome to join us if you wish.

884
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:07,460
{\an8}No!

885
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:11,250
{\an8}We won't make way for traitors like you!

886
01:20:11,790 --> 01:20:13,750
Soldiers, get ready!

887
01:20:13,830 --> 01:20:15,080
Yes, Commander!

888
01:20:16,210 --> 01:20:18,750
All right, if you insist.

889
01:20:19,630 --> 01:20:21,170
Attack!

890
01:20:37,170 --> 01:20:39,630
They dared to resist us.

891
01:20:40,830 --> 01:20:44,830
Everyone, show no mercy.

892
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:18,710
Stop this, Lembugiri!

893
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:20,790
You've gone too far!

894
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:25,500
What do you plan to do?

895
01:21:26,290 --> 01:21:27,790
Stop me?

896
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:31,380
I have surpassed even the gods.

897
01:21:32,790 --> 01:21:35,250
You cannot stop me.

898
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:38,540
Nothing in this world is immortal.

899
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:31,170
Impressive.

900
01:22:33,290 --> 01:22:38,540
I never imagined mortals like you
would defy a god.

901
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:43,960
It's a shame, though.

902
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,420
You're nowhere near my level.

903
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:02,250
Lembugiri, you...

904
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:08,750
You don't seem to realize.

905
01:23:09,580 --> 01:23:14,080
The power of the relic flows into
the body of its holder.

906
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:18,160
Whoever wields it,

907
01:23:18,250 --> 01:23:21,460
will possess its power.

908
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:26,500
Now, then...

909
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:30,050
Time for you to die.

910
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:33,960
Panji!

911
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:37,330
You fool!

912
01:23:38,170 --> 01:23:42,840
Why would you throw your life away
to protect him?

913
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:54,130
How is this possible?

914
01:23:55,710 --> 01:23:56,710
<i>Could it be...</i>

915
01:23:58,830 --> 01:24:04,080
Nothing can exist on its own.

916
01:24:06,330 --> 01:24:10,410
{\an8}Everything needs a counterbalance.

917
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:14,580
<i>...he studied the dark arts
to counter the Adidaya relic?</i>

918
01:24:15,830 --> 01:24:20,160
<i>To keep the relic
from falling into the wrong hands?</i>

919
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:21,080
<i>And...</i>

920
01:24:24,170 --> 01:24:28,340
<i>that boy has unintentionally mastered it?</i>

921
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,130
Gantari.

922
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:40,500
<i>If you really regret your actions,</i>

923
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,210
<i>why don't you try redeeming yourself?</i>

924
01:27:45,290 --> 01:27:47,040
<i>You are Panji Tengkorak.</i>

925
01:27:48,130 --> 01:27:50,300
<i>The undefeated warrior.</i>

926
01:27:52,460 --> 01:27:56,460
<i>You could use that power
to help those in need.</i>

927
01:27:57,460 --> 01:28:01,540
<i>I'm sure that's what Murni
would want you to do.</i>

928
01:28:08,420 --> 01:28:09,840
As promised.

929
01:28:11,710 --> 01:28:13,340
You may kill me.

930
01:28:14,210 --> 01:28:17,250
I'm responsible for all your suffering.

931
01:28:18,750 --> 01:28:21,790
If my death can bring you peace,

932
01:28:23,170 --> 01:28:25,170
I'm willing to offer it.

933
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:33,510
Your death means nothing to me.

934
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:50,170
<i>Have you heard?</i>

935
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:55,750
<i>There's a rumor spreading around
about a powerful dark arts warrior.</i>

936
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:05,170
{\an8}They say he wiped out
an entire village by himself.

937
01:29:06,630 --> 01:29:10,670
{\an8}Slaughtering everyone without mercy.

938
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:15,420
But apparently he stands for the weak.

939
01:29:17,170 --> 01:29:21,670
With his dark arts, he kills the wicked

940
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:25,830
and fights injustice.

941
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:28,800
{\an8}- Who is he?
- Where does he come from?

942
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:31,210
{\an8}Nobody knows.

943
01:29:31,290 --> 01:29:35,000
{\an8}People call him the Devil from the South.

944
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:38,040
{\an8}Devil from the South?

945
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:41,460
{\an8}But he's better known as...

946
01:29:42,670 --> 01:29:44,800
Panji Tengkorak.

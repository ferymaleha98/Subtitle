3
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:44,916
There's something under my bed.

4
00:02:46,451 --> 00:02:47,919
Don't touch the floor.

5
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,155
It can't get you
if you don't touch the floor.

6
00:03:01,899 --> 00:03:03,668
There's nothing under your bed.

7
00:03:03,801 --> 00:03:05,770
- Nothing but dust bunnies.
- I know.

8
00:03:06,804 --> 00:03:08,039
He'll eat you.

9
00:03:09,741 --> 00:03:11,042
Go to sleep, Aurora.

10
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:14,612
Good night, Aurora.

11
00:04:04,529 --> 00:04:06,431
I wish, I wish, I wish.

12
00:04:06,564 --> 00:04:08,199
I wish, I wish.

13
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,201
I wish, I wish, I wish.

14
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,270
I wish, I wish, I wish...

15
00:04:56,548 --> 00:04:57,615
Aurora?

16
00:04:58,383 --> 00:04:59,951
- Yeah?
- Get up here.

17
00:06:23,535 --> 00:06:25,002
Come on.

18
00:13:54,485 --> 00:13:55,686
- Aurora?
- Aurora!

19
00:13:55,819 --> 00:13:57,288
What are you doing out there?

20
00:13:57,421 --> 00:13:59,190
- How'd you get outside?
- Get in here. Are you okay?

21
00:13:59,723 --> 00:14:00,657
Get in here.

22
00:14:27,484 --> 00:14:30,621
I don't like you
going to bed so upset, Aurora.

23
00:14:31,688 --> 00:14:35,326
I want you to think
about all your worries

24
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:37,528
and put them in my pocket.

25
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:42,666
Everything you're afraid of.

26
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,801
Everything you're afraid
will happen.

27
00:14:45,502 --> 00:14:46,837
Put it all in my pocket

28
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:49,406
and I'll hold it for you
so you can sleep.

29
00:14:51,342 --> 00:14:52,343
Hmm?

30
00:14:53,844 --> 00:14:55,212
Are all your worries in there?

31
00:15:00,284 --> 00:15:01,518
Oh. Boop.

32
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,022
Good night, Aurora.

33
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,558
Goodbye, Daddy.

34
00:15:09,526 --> 00:15:10,928
You're too old to suck
your knuckle.

35
00:15:11,062 --> 00:15:12,563
You're gonna get buck teeth.

36
00:15:15,132 --> 00:15:16,400
Good night, Aurora.

37
00:15:17,068 --> 00:15:18,435
Goodbye, Mommy.

38
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:02,446
Aurora?

39
00:16:03,214 --> 00:16:05,549
Aurora?
What is going on in there?

40
00:16:07,218 --> 00:16:08,652
Aurora?

41
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,181
Mom?

42
00:17:22,659 --> 00:17:23,660
Mom?

00:24:26,983 --> 00:24:30,186

00:24:30,353 --> 00:24:33,490

Is that enough money?

60
00:27:21,591 --> 00:27:22,893
For what?

61
00:27:23,026 --> 00:27:24,560
To procure your services.

62
00:27:25,295 --> 00:27:26,596
I haven't counted it.

63
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:31,401
How do you know
the word "procure"?

64
00:27:32,969 --> 00:27:34,337
Word-a-day calendar.

65
00:27:54,991 --> 00:27:56,259
What's your name?

66
00:27:56,392 --> 00:27:58,261
Or is "A" your name?

67
00:27:59,262 --> 00:28:01,865
Aurora. What's your name?

68
00:28:07,337 --> 00:28:11,207
I've got 327 dollars and...

69
00:28:11,341 --> 00:28:14,510
42 cents here, Aurora.

70
00:28:14,644 --> 00:28:16,212
Where'd you get all this money?

71
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:18,949
I robbed a church.

72
00:28:20,283 --> 00:28:22,452
Is that enough
to kill a monster?

73
00:28:24,755 --> 00:28:26,656
What makes you think
I kill monsters?

74
00:28:27,423 --> 00:28:28,859
I saw you kill one.

75
00:28:31,361 --> 00:28:32,462
What did you see?

76
00:28:34,164 --> 00:28:35,365
In Chinatown.

77
00:28:36,867 --> 00:28:38,634
Behind a dim sum restaurant.

78
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:41,037
I saw a dragon.

79
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:44,074
And you killed it.

80
00:28:46,442 --> 00:28:48,011
You saw me kill a dragon?

81
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:54,985
How did I kill it, Aurora?

82
00:28:56,186 --> 00:28:57,888
You slid under its belly...

83
00:28:58,021 --> 00:29:00,023
...gut it like a fish.

84
00:29:00,556 --> 00:29:02,658
And then you cut off its head.

85
00:29:05,495 --> 00:29:07,397
You got some imagination.

86
00:29:07,998 --> 00:29:09,232
I got two eyes.

87
00:29:12,302 --> 00:29:13,703
Monsters aren't real.

88
00:29:13,837 --> 00:29:15,171
Yes, they are.

89
00:29:16,006 --> 00:29:17,073
Don't pretend.

90
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:19,709
Grown-ups don't pretend.

91
00:29:19,843 --> 00:29:21,744
Grown-ups pretend
not to be afraid.

92
00:29:21,878 --> 00:29:24,247
But they are. All the time.

93
00:29:30,086 --> 00:29:31,587
That's mostly true.

94
00:29:34,724 --> 00:29:36,259
- Erora...
- Aurora.

95
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,628
Erora.

96
00:29:38,761 --> 00:29:40,730
- Aurora.
- Little girl...

97
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:44,134
have you told your parents
I kill monsters?

98
00:29:49,239 --> 00:29:50,540
Stop it.

99
00:29:53,844 --> 00:29:55,545
What do your parents think
about monsters?

100
00:29:55,678 --> 00:29:56,612
Do they believe in them?

101
00:29:56,746 --> 00:29:57,881
They do now.

102
00:29:58,681 --> 00:29:59,782
Now they do?

103
00:30:00,951 --> 00:30:03,987
They didn't before,
but now they do.

104
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,555
It's hard not to believe
in something

105
00:30:05,688 --> 00:30:07,223
when it's eating you.

106
00:30:07,357 --> 00:30:08,424
Ate you.

107
00:30:12,628 --> 00:30:14,397
A monster ate your parents?

108
00:30:16,232 --> 00:30:17,233
Yep.

109
00:30:18,101 --> 00:30:19,635
Like the one
you think you saw me

110
00:30:19,769 --> 00:30:22,605
slide under its belly
and gut like a fish?

111
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:23,773
Yeah.

112
00:30:25,475 --> 00:30:27,343
And this monster lives
under your bed?

113
00:30:27,477 --> 00:30:28,644
Yes.

114
00:30:32,148 --> 00:30:33,249
Show me.

115
00:31:05,681 --> 00:31:07,550
Did you see it eat your parents?

116
00:31:08,251 --> 00:31:09,652
I was under my blanket.

117
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,555
You just heard them
getting eaten?

118
00:31:14,124 --> 00:31:17,160
I just...
heard them getting got.

119
00:31:23,666 --> 00:31:25,401
That's my mom and dad's room.

120
00:31:25,868 --> 00:31:27,803
I think they tried
to hide in there.

121
00:31:42,052 --> 00:31:43,219
There's no blood.

122
00:31:44,154 --> 00:31:46,756
Generally, when something
is eaten, there's blood.

123
00:31:46,889 --> 00:31:48,224
It ate them whole.

124
00:31:55,198 --> 00:31:57,100
Did your mom or dad have a gun?

125
00:31:59,069 --> 00:32:00,503
Somebody had a gun.

126
00:32:00,636 --> 00:32:02,005
You hear a gun go off?

127
00:32:14,985 --> 00:32:16,086
Told you so.

128
00:32:19,555 --> 00:32:21,057
This all looks like
it made some noise.

129
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:23,126
Your parents
didn't call for help?

130
00:32:27,063 --> 00:32:28,264
You have neighbors.

131
00:32:29,265 --> 00:32:30,466
No one heard this?

132
00:32:31,434 --> 00:32:33,703
It eats everything.

133
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:36,239
It even eats your screams.

134
00:32:43,913 --> 00:32:48,418
Will it eat your "I told you so"
when it eats me?

135
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:50,653
I'll tell you
"I told you so" now,

136
00:32:50,786 --> 00:32:51,954
and when you get eaten,

137
00:32:52,088 --> 00:32:54,257
you'll know
I already told you so.

138
00:33:06,369 --> 00:33:08,271
Why didn't you go to the police?

139
00:33:08,404 --> 00:33:10,173
Why aren't you going
to the police now?

140
00:33:10,306 --> 00:33:12,142
I don't know
what I would tell them.

141
00:33:12,275 --> 00:33:13,576
See?

142
00:33:15,578 --> 00:33:17,347
I could tell them, uh,
there's a little girl

143
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,082
who's been abandoned
by her parents.

144
00:33:19,949 --> 00:33:23,019
You can tell them that.
After you kill it.

145
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:29,792
I'm trying to understand this
the way you understand this,

146
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,794
little girl.

147
00:33:32,995 --> 00:33:35,131
The monster you think
you saw me kill...

148
00:33:35,265 --> 00:33:37,100
I know, I saw you kill it.

149
00:33:38,501 --> 00:33:40,436
Your monster, it's like that?

150
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:42,338
That's why I hired you.

151
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,342
I haven't agreed to be hired.

152
00:33:48,978 --> 00:33:51,047
I don't know what you saw
behind that dim sum restaurant

153
00:33:51,181 --> 00:33:52,882
but I didn't kill any monsters.

154
00:33:54,016 --> 00:33:55,951
I didn't kill anything.

155
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,656
That's really why you won't go
to the police.

156
00:34:02,024 --> 00:34:04,627
Killing things
is against the law.

157
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,562
Have you killed a lot of things?

158
00:34:07,363 --> 00:34:10,032
You seem like you've killed
a lot of things.

159
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,875
In my experience,
the sort of monster

160
00:34:20,009 --> 00:34:23,213
that can eat a person whole
and not spill a drop

161
00:34:23,946 --> 00:34:25,548
does not do so randomly.

162
00:34:25,681 --> 00:34:27,383
Are you done pretending now?

163
00:34:28,951 --> 00:34:31,053
I'm seeing things
how you see things.

164
00:34:33,189 --> 00:34:35,425
Why would a monster
eat your family?

165
00:34:36,692 --> 00:34:37,927
They touched the floor.

166
00:34:40,296 --> 00:34:41,664
If your monster's like mine,

167
00:34:41,797 --> 00:34:44,167
it doesn't eat people
for walking on the floor.

168
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:47,170
Why did your monster
want to eat you?

169
00:34:52,975 --> 00:34:54,777
Because I kill monsters.

170
00:34:55,711 --> 00:34:56,712
Hmm.

171
00:34:57,747 --> 00:35:00,216
Yeah. Uh, go home, little girl.

172
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:02,918
There's something under my bed
that wants to eat me.

173
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:05,588
Then don't touch the floor.

174
00:35:37,687 --> 00:35:39,222
Didn't think I'd see you again.

175
00:35:40,022 --> 00:35:42,558
I'd hug you, but as you know,

176
00:35:42,692 --> 00:35:45,495
I really don't put effort
into such things.

177
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,135
- You ordered a sandwich?
- I did.

178
00:35:55,037 --> 00:35:56,138
You want half?

179
00:36:06,549 --> 00:36:08,451
I'm trying to unclench my jaw.

180
00:36:09,819 --> 00:36:12,121
It's in a perpetual
state of clench,

181
00:36:12,255 --> 00:36:13,423
so I have to...

182
00:36:15,258 --> 00:36:16,826
uh, release it...

183
00:36:16,959 --> 00:36:18,761
so it doesn't pop out
of my skull

184
00:36:18,894 --> 00:36:20,930
when I take a bite of food.

185
00:36:26,802 --> 00:36:27,803
Mmm.

186
00:36:29,905 --> 00:36:31,173
Mmm.

187
00:36:31,307 --> 00:36:33,643
Mmm, mm.

188
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:39,649
Mm, mm, mm.

189
00:36:41,984 --> 00:36:44,220
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

190
00:36:45,988 --> 00:36:47,156
Mm.

191
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:49,892
Either of these familiar?

192
00:36:52,295 --> 00:36:53,829
Should they be?

193
00:36:53,963 --> 00:36:55,197
They're my neighbors.

194
00:36:55,331 --> 00:36:56,899
Professionally disappeared.

195
00:36:57,032 --> 00:36:59,068
You've actually met
your neighbors?

196
00:36:59,201 --> 00:37:00,636
I'm aware of them.

197
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:01,971
Daughter was home
when it happened.

198
00:37:02,104 --> 00:37:03,373
She see it?

199
00:37:03,506 --> 00:37:04,707
She heard it.

200
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,042
Thought it was a monster
under her bed.

201
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:09,379
You're looking for a monster?

202
00:37:09,979 --> 00:37:11,847
The monster's looking for me.

203
00:37:11,981 --> 00:37:14,250
And I think that monster
got the wrong apartment.

204
00:37:14,384 --> 00:37:17,487
Monster's lucky
it got the wrong apartment.

205
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:20,523
Must have broken in
and realized their mistake.

206
00:37:20,656 --> 00:37:22,525
Had to kill the parents
who'd seen them.

207
00:37:23,225 --> 00:37:25,761
That girl didn't see anything.
They let her live.

208
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:28,564
I'll take a look at these.

209
00:37:33,903 --> 00:37:36,906
How do you know the little girl
didn't see anything?

210
00:37:38,007 --> 00:37:39,742
She told me
she didn't see anything.

211
00:37:40,543 --> 00:37:41,711
She saw you.

212
00:37:43,012 --> 00:37:45,415
There's a little girl
who knows your face.

213
00:37:46,248 --> 00:37:47,450
She know what you do?

214
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:48,918
She doesn't know anything.

215
00:37:49,051 --> 00:37:51,053
She saw monsters.
She believes in monsters.

216
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:52,955
You're a monster.

217
00:37:53,088 --> 00:37:54,457
She believe in you?

218
00:37:55,925 --> 00:37:57,960
I'm not gonna kill
a little girl.

219
00:37:58,928 --> 00:38:01,263
Because you already killed
her parents?

220
00:38:02,332 --> 00:38:04,400
You did not kill
that girl's parents.

221
00:38:04,534 --> 00:38:08,137
Ah, I almost certainly,
if not at least arguably, did.

222
00:38:11,374 --> 00:38:13,909
A cheetah kills a baboon.

223
00:38:14,043 --> 00:38:16,646
Discovers its baby
is still clinging onto dead mom.

224
00:38:16,779 --> 00:38:18,213
What's the cheetah do?

225
00:38:18,348 --> 00:38:19,715
Doesn't eat the baby.

226
00:38:20,282 --> 00:38:22,251
Even a cheetah knows
it's an asshole thing

227
00:38:22,385 --> 00:38:23,586
to orphan a child.

228
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:25,788
Yeah, I saw that Nat Geo.

229
00:38:27,089 --> 00:38:28,391
Baby died anyway.

230
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:31,260
Cheetah moved on.

231
00:38:33,128 --> 00:38:34,263
So should you.

232
00:39:54,677 --> 00:39:55,878
Get off the floor!

233
00:39:56,011 --> 00:39:57,379
A monster's coming.
Get under your bed.

234
00:39:57,513 --> 00:39:59,214
There's a monster under my bed.

235
00:40:00,015 --> 00:40:01,383
Get in the closet then.

236
00:44:49,972 --> 00:44:51,273
Was there someone in here?

237
00:44:53,142 --> 00:44:54,643
They get out the fire escape?

238
00:44:55,778 --> 00:44:57,146
She got got.

239
00:44:59,915 --> 00:45:01,116
Your monster?

240
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,522
I'm touching the floor.
Where's your monster now?

241
00:45:08,123 --> 00:45:09,291
Why's it not here?

242
00:45:10,793 --> 00:45:12,061
It's eating.

243
00:45:18,768 --> 00:45:19,969
Come here.

244
00:45:37,686 --> 00:45:39,354
If there was someone
in your room

245
00:45:39,488 --> 00:45:41,256
and they got away,
they will be back.

246
00:45:43,225 --> 00:45:44,426
They didn't get away.

247
00:45:46,896 --> 00:45:48,030
Stay there.

248
00:47:25,327 --> 00:47:26,595
What are you doing?

249
00:47:38,407 --> 00:47:40,943
I'm draining his fluids
so when I cut him into pieces,

250
00:47:41,076 --> 00:47:42,311
it won't be messy.

251
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:44,513
Why do you have to cut him
into pieces?

252
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,549
I have to get rid
of the body.

253
00:47:48,317 --> 00:47:50,819
Why don't you just
put it in my room?

254
00:47:51,486 --> 00:47:52,888
Let the monster eat him.

255
00:47:59,094 --> 00:48:00,662
Have you ever been to a butcher?

256
00:48:00,795 --> 00:48:01,897
Yes.

257
00:48:02,932 --> 00:48:05,700
What I need to do is like
what they do with pigs and cows

258
00:48:05,834 --> 00:48:08,170
at the butcher,
but with a person.

259
00:48:09,004 --> 00:48:11,740
Only we're trying to get him in
a suitcase, not our stomachs.

260
00:48:11,873 --> 00:48:14,809
- I love pigs.
- Ah, a cow, then.

261
00:48:16,278 --> 00:48:19,048
So anything you're comfortable
with being done to a cow,

262
00:48:19,181 --> 00:48:21,583
you should be fine with me
doing to this guy.

263
00:48:21,716 --> 00:48:23,152
- Can I watch?
- No.

264
00:48:53,983 --> 00:48:55,884
You can't tell
he's people anymore.

265
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:00,355
You can help me
wrap up the pieces,

266
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:02,224
if you want.

267
00:49:11,733 --> 00:49:12,801
Who was he?

268
00:49:13,668 --> 00:49:14,736
A killer.

269
00:49:16,571 --> 00:49:17,872
Did he come to kill the monster?

270
00:49:18,007 --> 00:49:20,375
Oh, you have to stop
talking about monsters.

271
00:49:20,509 --> 00:49:22,577
A monster
didn't eat your parents.

272
00:49:22,711 --> 00:49:24,213
Your parents were killed.

273
00:49:28,783 --> 00:49:31,720
Did someone cut them
into pieces?

274
00:49:40,062 --> 00:49:41,330
He came to kill me.

275
00:49:42,864 --> 00:49:43,932
Or you.

276
00:49:44,933 --> 00:49:46,935
He came to kill one of us.

277
00:49:47,069 --> 00:49:48,437
Me, for my reasons.

278
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:50,172
You, for my mistake.

279
00:49:51,706 --> 00:49:53,175
Why would he wanna kill me?

280
00:49:57,812 --> 00:49:59,948
There was no monster
in Chinatown.

281
00:50:00,082 --> 00:50:01,183
Those were men.

282
00:50:01,316 --> 00:50:03,285
A monster
didn't kill your parents.

283
00:50:03,418 --> 00:50:05,620
Those were men
who wanted to kill me

284
00:50:05,754 --> 00:50:07,189
because of monsters I've killed.

285
00:50:07,322 --> 00:50:10,159
Monsters who were men.

286
00:50:12,327 --> 00:50:14,329
You don't have to feel bad
because a monster

287
00:50:14,463 --> 00:50:16,298
- ate my parents.
- Stop saying that.

288
00:50:16,431 --> 00:50:17,999
Just 'cause you don't want it
to be that way

289
00:50:18,133 --> 00:50:19,934
doesn't mean
it's not gonna be that way.

290
00:50:20,069 --> 00:50:21,636
'Cause that's the way it is.

291
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:23,438
A monster ate my parents.

292
00:50:23,572 --> 00:50:25,774
A monster will always eat
my parents,

293
00:50:25,907 --> 00:50:27,442
unless you kill it.

294
00:50:27,576 --> 00:50:29,844
I'd love to believe there was
a monster under your bed,

295
00:50:29,978 --> 00:50:31,613
little girl.

296
00:50:31,746 --> 00:50:33,448
Happiest I've ever been
was believing

297
00:50:33,582 --> 00:50:36,451
- in something impossible.
- You're gonna be very happy.

298
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:55,337
Hi.

299
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:58,307
I'm Brenda Bautista
with Child and Family Services.

300
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,075
Are you Aurora's...

301
00:51:00,209 --> 00:51:01,210
Yes.

302
00:51:01,943 --> 00:51:03,212
Hello, Aurora.

303
00:51:03,878 --> 00:51:04,879
Hi.

304
00:51:06,715 --> 00:51:08,083
We had an appointment.

305
00:51:11,186 --> 00:51:12,654
We did?

306
00:51:12,787 --> 00:51:15,257
If you'd like,
I can give you a few minutes

307
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:17,058
to get yourself together.

308
00:51:19,528 --> 00:51:21,830
This isn't coming together
anytime soon.

309
00:51:21,963 --> 00:51:23,665
We'll have to reschedule.

310
00:51:25,234 --> 00:51:27,369
It's challenging being a parent.

311
00:51:27,502 --> 00:51:30,405
Hmm. Particularly
being a foster parent.

312
00:51:32,741 --> 00:51:33,908
Yeah.

313
00:51:34,042 --> 00:51:36,378
Particularly...
being a foster parent.

314
00:51:38,213 --> 00:51:39,414
We're the first...

315
00:51:40,149 --> 00:51:44,219
family to come into her life
since what happened.

316
00:51:45,587 --> 00:51:48,690
And trust isn't easy
in the best of circumstances.

317
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,461
Third family.

318
00:51:53,662 --> 00:51:55,564
You're her third foster family.

319
00:51:55,697 --> 00:51:58,032
They did go over that
with you, right?

320
00:51:58,167 --> 00:52:00,769
- And you do know that?
- Yes. Of course.

321
00:52:01,503 --> 00:52:04,306
Of course, I'm-I'm speaking
in that we're the first family

322
00:52:04,439 --> 00:52:08,810
to come into her life
since the last family did so.

323
00:52:08,943 --> 00:52:12,647
And I've always been--
I'm sorry.

324
00:52:13,515 --> 00:52:14,716
I'm under the weather.

325
00:52:14,849 --> 00:52:16,818
We are all under
the weather here.

326
00:52:16,951 --> 00:52:18,920
You shouldn't come any closer,
or inside.

327
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:20,755
I was hoping I could use
your restroom.

328
00:52:20,889 --> 00:52:22,056
No.

329
00:52:24,526 --> 00:52:27,429
I should tell you
and I hate to tell you this

330
00:52:27,562 --> 00:52:29,063
because I know how it sounds,

331
00:52:29,198 --> 00:52:32,133
but if you fail to keep
your appointment,

332
00:52:32,267 --> 00:52:34,769
it does go
on your permanent record.

333
00:52:35,604 --> 00:52:38,006
Brenda, you know
how that sounds,

334
00:52:38,139 --> 00:52:41,810
- and you still said it anyway.
- I know. It's not a threat.

335
00:52:41,943 --> 00:52:45,347
I know. Let's reschedule.
Sorry for any inconvenience.

336
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,182
Bye-bye.

337
00:52:47,316 --> 00:52:49,418
You should wash your hand.

338
00:52:52,454 --> 00:52:53,455
Hmm.

339
00:52:55,490 --> 00:52:57,158
That's not your social worker.

340
00:53:00,929 --> 00:53:02,531
That's not her foster father.

341
00:53:20,815 --> 00:53:23,218
So, this is your third family.

342
00:53:25,254 --> 00:53:27,522
How many of your families
has this monster eaten?

343
00:53:28,823 --> 00:53:29,858
All of them.

344
00:53:29,991 --> 00:53:32,627
All of them?
And no one believes you?

345
00:53:33,462 --> 00:53:34,463
Nope.

346
00:53:41,035 --> 00:53:43,071
Maybe we approach this
scientifically.

347
00:53:43,204 --> 00:53:44,706
Children are scientists.

348
00:53:44,839 --> 00:53:47,509
You don't play, you experiment.

349
00:53:47,642 --> 00:53:49,043
Gather data. Analyze.

350
00:53:49,177 --> 00:53:51,413
But your heads are so full
of shit and Santa Claus,

351
00:53:51,546 --> 00:53:53,214
you don't know what's real.

352
00:53:55,484 --> 00:53:57,151
- I know what's real.
- No.

353
00:53:57,819 --> 00:53:59,020
You think you know.

354
00:53:59,988 --> 00:54:01,323
You think you know.

355
00:54:07,496 --> 00:54:09,331
Where did your monster
come from?

356
00:54:10,399 --> 00:54:11,666
I wished for it.

357
00:54:13,802 --> 00:54:15,537
I wished on a shooting star,

358
00:54:16,905 --> 00:54:19,073
like I wished for you
to kill it.

359
00:54:19,974 --> 00:54:24,078
Wishing isn't scientifically
sound, evidence-based thinking,
little girl.

360
00:54:39,994 --> 00:54:41,396
Why did you wish for it?

361
00:54:42,364 --> 00:54:44,533
I wanted it to eat my parents.

362
00:54:45,767 --> 00:54:47,636
Why did you want a monster
to eat your parents?

363
00:54:49,604 --> 00:54:51,239
They weren't very nice to me.

364
00:54:53,608 --> 00:54:54,943
You're mad at Mom and Dad.

365
00:54:55,076 --> 00:54:57,479
You wished they'd go away
so you wished a wish

366
00:54:57,612 --> 00:54:59,113
you wish you hadn't wished.

367
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:04,052
All your parents
weren't very nice?

368
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:06,588
Some of them were nice.

369
00:55:07,356 --> 00:55:09,324
Then why did the monster
eat them?

370
00:55:09,958 --> 00:55:12,761
It was trying to eat me.

371
00:55:16,030 --> 00:55:18,500
What have you done, hmm?

372
00:55:19,868 --> 00:55:21,936
Have you seen something
you shouldn't have seen?

373
00:55:24,473 --> 00:55:26,475
What makes you so tasty, Erora?

374
00:55:26,608 --> 00:55:28,677
- Aurora.
- Arora.

375
00:55:29,578 --> 00:55:31,179
- Aurora.
- Erora.

376
00:55:31,312 --> 00:55:34,148
- Aurora.
- Yes. Aurora.

377
00:55:38,453 --> 00:55:39,588
I'm wicked.

378
00:55:40,121 --> 00:55:41,590
Who said you were wicked?

379
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:45,259
It knows I'm wicked.

380
00:55:46,094 --> 00:55:50,665
It keeps eating my family
'cause I don't deserve a family.

381
00:55:52,734 --> 00:55:54,035
I've met wicked.

382
00:55:54,168 --> 00:55:56,104
Trust me, you're not wicked.

383
00:56:00,074 --> 00:56:01,476
Where's your monster now?

384
00:56:18,593 --> 00:56:20,495
It sleeps during the day.

385
00:56:20,629 --> 00:56:21,796
Under your bed?

386
00:56:22,797 --> 00:56:25,033
Under the floor under my bed.

387
00:56:25,166 --> 00:56:28,737
It mostly comes out at night
and tries to eat me.

388
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:31,406
It won't stop
until it does eat me.

389
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:34,042
So you should kill it
before it can do that.

390
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:37,378
Did you try wishing it away?

391
00:56:37,512 --> 00:56:39,581
It didn't work, obviously.

392
00:56:48,222 --> 00:56:50,391
Say I do kill your monster.

393
00:56:50,525 --> 00:56:52,927
Then what? Where do you go?

394
00:56:55,129 --> 00:56:58,366
There are places where children
in your position usually go.

395
00:56:58,967 --> 00:57:00,368
If they catch me.

396
00:57:04,238 --> 00:57:05,940
You don't have any other family?

397
00:57:07,008 --> 00:57:08,009
No.

398
00:57:09,511 --> 00:57:10,579
Do you?

399
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:14,883
No one who'd miss you
if you were gone?

400
00:57:16,551 --> 00:57:17,552
No.

401
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:20,288
They were all eaten.

402
00:57:22,857 --> 00:57:25,359
Anybody who'd miss you
if you were gone?

403
00:57:33,234 --> 00:57:35,136
I'd miss you if you were gone.

404
00:57:54,288 --> 00:57:57,125
- What's in the suitcase?
- "Who's in the suitcase?"

405
00:57:58,292 --> 00:58:00,595
- Is it the little one?
- That's the big one.

406
00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:03,164
This is the little one.

407
00:58:03,297 --> 00:58:04,999
He killed her.

408
00:58:05,967 --> 00:58:07,001
You killed him.

409
00:58:08,369 --> 00:58:09,838
Return to sender.

410
00:58:09,971 --> 00:58:11,640
I sent two.

411
00:58:12,306 --> 00:58:14,475
I only saw the one
you sent to kill me.

412
00:58:17,779 --> 00:58:19,614
Lapsang souchong.
You want some?

413
00:58:19,748 --> 00:58:21,082
Yes, please.

414
00:58:23,317 --> 00:58:26,320
I didn't send anybody
to kill you.

415
00:58:26,454 --> 00:58:29,490
Now, I'm asking you
to be honest.

416
00:58:29,624 --> 00:58:31,693
Who was trying to kill whom

417
00:58:31,826 --> 00:58:35,530
and is there an argument
to be made for self-defense?

418
00:58:35,664 --> 00:58:37,966
Because nobody
was supposed to kill you.

419
00:58:40,401 --> 00:58:42,537
I may have thrown
the first... what have you.

420
00:58:42,671 --> 00:58:44,005
Mmm.

421
00:58:44,138 --> 00:58:46,440
Well, I really was just
trying to help.

422
00:58:47,075 --> 00:58:50,645
I saw the gesture
as a professional courtesy. Mm.

423
00:58:51,445 --> 00:58:53,514
I thought I was being
magnanimous.

424
00:58:54,649 --> 00:58:56,350
Sending someone
to kill a little girl?

425
00:58:56,484 --> 00:58:58,687
Sending someone
to kill a witness

426
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:01,690
who knows your face
and knows what you do.

427
00:59:02,924 --> 00:59:04,358
If you wanna judge me
on the ease

428
00:59:04,492 --> 00:59:06,795
with which I can kill a child,
have at it.

429
00:59:06,928 --> 00:59:10,198
I am eating
a suckling pig tea sandwich.

430
00:59:11,833 --> 00:59:14,202
I was navigating
that little girl.

431
00:59:14,936 --> 00:59:16,070
You seem triggered.

432
00:59:16,204 --> 00:59:18,406
That little girl
clearly triggered you

433
00:59:18,539 --> 00:59:20,208
with the cheetahs
and the baboons.

434
00:59:20,341 --> 00:59:22,977
At least this way,
the deed would be done

435
00:59:23,111 --> 00:59:26,147
and you could suppress
or wallow however you chose,

436
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:29,083
but it would be one less thing
for you to worry about.

437
00:59:34,322 --> 00:59:35,389
You're welcome.

438
00:59:37,826 --> 00:59:38,893
Thank you.

439
00:59:40,695 --> 00:59:41,763
You're welcome.

440
00:59:42,563 --> 00:59:44,165
Genuinely, this time.

441
00:59:44,298 --> 00:59:47,368
That first one
was mostly sarcasm.

442
00:59:52,073 --> 00:59:54,843
What happened
to the second package I sent?

443
00:59:56,144 --> 00:59:57,846
Did you kill her too?

444
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:01,182
What am I gonna tell
these people's families?

445
01:00:01,315 --> 01:00:03,517
I never saw the second package.

446
01:00:03,652 --> 01:00:05,219
Monster under the bed get her?

447
01:00:05,353 --> 01:00:07,856
Yeah, well...
Yeah. Yeah.

448
01:00:08,890 --> 01:00:10,959
No one has heard of the parents.

449
01:00:11,693 --> 01:00:13,194
No one knows anything
about them

450
01:00:13,327 --> 01:00:16,064
beyond the most tedious
of details.

451
01:00:17,431 --> 01:00:20,935
Wasn't even their daughter.
Fostering to adopt.

452
01:00:21,903 --> 01:00:23,571
What happened
to her birth parents?

453
01:00:23,705 --> 01:00:24,873
They abandoned her.

454
01:00:25,439 --> 01:00:27,976
Packed up and left her behind.

455
01:00:28,109 --> 01:00:29,610
Do you see a pattern?

456
01:00:29,744 --> 01:00:31,145
I see a pattern.

457
01:00:31,279 --> 01:00:34,148
I think we know
who the real monster was.

458
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:39,153
I kill monsters.

459
01:00:40,121 --> 01:00:41,990
No one followed you home.

460
01:00:42,123 --> 01:00:43,658
No one knows where you live.

461
01:00:43,792 --> 01:00:45,493
Although, I would move anyway.

462
01:00:46,094 --> 01:00:48,396
And I found out
who's trying to kill you.

463
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,401
Who?

464
01:00:55,069 --> 01:00:56,404
Everybody.

465
01:00:56,537 --> 01:00:59,140
Everybody's trying to kill you.
It's remarkable.

466
01:00:59,273 --> 01:01:01,075
And in your line of work, inevitable.

467
01:01:01,209 --> 01:01:03,912
So, congratulations.

468
01:01:04,045 --> 01:01:05,413
And condolences.

469
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:13,788
Is that the baby baboon?

470
01:01:14,723 --> 01:01:16,791
Who's in the little suitcase?

471
01:01:18,893 --> 01:01:21,162
We couldn't get him all in
in one bag.

472
01:01:22,897 --> 01:01:24,465
"We"?

473
01:01:25,099 --> 01:01:27,501
I told you
to wait for me at home.

474
01:01:27,635 --> 01:01:29,170
You weren't coming home.

475
01:01:29,303 --> 01:01:30,705
You were gonna leave me.

476
01:01:30,839 --> 01:01:33,541
That does seem to happen
to her a lot.

477
01:01:33,674 --> 01:01:36,677
Aurora, come over here.

478
01:01:36,811 --> 01:01:38,279
Sit next to me.

479
01:01:38,847 --> 01:01:39,981
I don't know you.

480
01:01:50,624 --> 01:01:51,625
You were gonna leave me.

481
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,527
I never told you I'd stay.

482
01:01:54,628 --> 01:01:57,465
I hired you. You took my money.

483
01:01:57,598 --> 01:02:01,069
Aurora, do you know
that there are cultures

484
01:02:01,202 --> 01:02:06,707
who won't even acknowledge
someone your age is a person?

485
01:02:07,842 --> 01:02:10,011
Delayed personhood,
they call it.

486
01:02:10,144 --> 01:02:11,579
You're just a little body

487
01:02:11,712 --> 01:02:14,582
with a soul
slowly growing inside of it,

488
01:02:14,715 --> 01:02:16,918
eventually becoming a person,

489
01:02:17,051 --> 01:02:19,653
but not a person yet.

490
01:02:19,788 --> 01:02:21,689
So you should let
the real persons talk.

491
01:02:21,823 --> 01:02:24,893
- I am--
- Nope. Shut your mouth.

492
01:02:29,798 --> 01:02:31,499
You want a sandwich?

493
01:02:32,733 --> 01:02:34,035
She doesn't eat pork.

494
01:02:34,702 --> 01:02:39,340
You, you are obviously
going through something here.

495
01:02:39,473 --> 01:02:40,909
I can see that.

496
01:02:41,042 --> 01:02:44,545
Some childhood trauma.
Stop that!

497
01:02:45,213 --> 01:02:48,349
This little girl
is not little you,

498
01:02:48,482 --> 01:02:51,552
and helping her
will not fix you.

499
01:02:51,685 --> 01:02:53,754
I know they say
that you can't truly work

500
01:02:53,888 --> 01:02:54,956
through childhood trauma

501
01:02:55,089 --> 01:02:57,091
without having a child
of your own.

502
01:02:57,225 --> 01:02:59,560
Implying childless people
are broken,

503
01:02:59,693 --> 01:03:01,362
a point of view
I don't subscribe to.

504
01:03:01,495 --> 01:03:02,897
- I'm gonna stop you there.
- There is no stopping

505
01:03:03,031 --> 01:03:05,533
this train. It's going
all the way to the station.

506
01:03:08,169 --> 01:03:10,138
Hired you to do what?

507
01:03:14,108 --> 01:03:15,910
To kill the monster
under her bed.

508
01:03:17,045 --> 01:03:20,214
The monster that ate
her foster parents?

509
01:03:20,348 --> 01:03:22,050
And her birth parents.

510
01:03:22,183 --> 01:03:24,085
And, well, all her parents.

511
01:03:24,218 --> 01:03:25,386
And the lady with a gun

512
01:03:25,519 --> 01:03:27,121
who crawled through
my bedroom window.

513
01:03:27,255 --> 01:03:28,990
- I never saw her.
- I saw her.

514
01:03:29,690 --> 01:03:30,825
I saw her get eaten.

515
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:33,928
I don't know
what to do with this.

516
01:03:34,062 --> 01:03:35,163
You see?

517
01:03:37,698 --> 01:03:39,233
Who killed the lady with a gun

518
01:03:39,367 --> 01:03:40,969
who crawled through
your bedroom window?

519
01:03:41,102 --> 01:03:43,004
- I never saw her.
- The monster under my bed.

520
01:03:47,141 --> 01:03:49,110
You're not the only one
with a monster

521
01:03:49,243 --> 01:03:50,678
under her bed, Aurora.

522
01:03:50,811 --> 01:03:54,615
Everybody, the everybody
that's trying to kill you,

523
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:56,784
they're never going to stop
trying to kill you

524
01:03:56,918 --> 01:03:59,420
until they've killed you
or you've been killed.

525
01:04:00,088 --> 01:04:02,924
You can never sleep
in the same bed twice.

526
01:04:03,057 --> 01:04:04,993
He can sleep in my bed.

527
01:04:05,593 --> 01:04:06,961
Let the monster eat them.

528
01:04:13,167 --> 01:04:14,468
Leave now.

529
01:04:14,602 --> 01:04:15,970
Get out of town.

530
01:04:16,104 --> 01:04:17,138
Don't go home.

531
01:04:17,271 --> 01:04:18,472
Don't get dim sum.

532
01:04:18,606 --> 01:04:19,840
Just get out.

533
01:04:19,974 --> 01:04:22,043
Get out of all of it.

534
01:04:45,033 --> 01:04:47,135
Hello. Welcome back.
The usual?

535
01:04:47,268 --> 01:04:48,336
Yes, please.

536
01:04:51,272 --> 01:04:52,907
That lady said you got problems.

537
01:04:55,109 --> 01:04:57,211
At the moment,
I have two problems.

538
01:04:57,345 --> 01:04:59,580
So we're clear,
you're one of them.

539
01:05:12,994 --> 01:05:15,196
You could just be my dad.

540
01:05:19,333 --> 01:05:20,434
You'd be a good dad.

541
01:05:20,568 --> 01:05:21,936
I don't wanna be
one of your dads, Erora.

542
01:05:22,070 --> 01:05:23,571
All your dads died.

543
01:05:25,006 --> 01:05:26,007
Aurora.

544
01:05:37,318 --> 01:05:39,954
I remember thinking my mother
was the most beautiful woman

545
01:05:40,088 --> 01:05:41,189
in the world.

546
01:05:41,822 --> 01:05:44,092
Then one day I took a good look
and realized,

547
01:05:44,225 --> 01:05:46,127
she's not, really.

548
01:05:47,395 --> 01:05:50,431
But my brain
wanted me to think so.

549
01:05:53,067 --> 01:05:56,070
Isn't that silly?

550
01:05:57,871 --> 01:06:00,374
So, whatever you think
you want or need from me

551
01:06:00,508 --> 01:06:01,709
isn't really what you think,

552
01:06:01,842 --> 01:06:03,477
it's what your brain
wants you to think.

553
01:06:04,412 --> 01:06:06,714
And whatever I think I want
or need from you...

554
01:06:06,847 --> 01:06:09,117
It's just what your brain
wants you to think?

555
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:10,484
Exactly.

556
01:06:11,285 --> 01:06:12,820
We don't really know each other.

557
01:06:15,523 --> 01:06:17,658
- I wished for you.
- Yes, you did that.

558
01:06:17,791 --> 01:06:20,594
But you didn't actually control
any of that happening.

559
01:06:20,728 --> 01:06:22,830
- Yes, I did.
- No. No, you didn't.

560
01:06:22,963 --> 01:06:24,798
- Yes, I did.
- No, you didn't.

561
01:06:24,932 --> 01:06:26,267
- I did.
- Nope.

562
01:06:28,036 --> 01:06:30,138
- I did.
- Well, you didn't, though.

563
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:32,506
I--

564
01:06:38,546 --> 01:06:39,680
May I sit down?

565
01:06:39,813 --> 01:06:41,315
I wouldn't if I were you.

566
01:06:44,385 --> 01:06:46,854
Is she your daughter?

567
01:06:46,987 --> 01:06:48,022
- Yes.
- No.

568
01:06:56,430 --> 01:06:58,332
I hate to question
your parenting--

569
01:06:58,466 --> 01:06:59,767
Then don't.

570
01:07:07,741 --> 01:07:09,443
Shrimp shumai.
Mushroom dumpling.

571
01:07:09,577 --> 01:07:11,445
Black sesame dragon cookie.

572
01:07:15,616 --> 01:07:17,151
Purse dumpling. Soup dumpling.

573
01:07:17,285 --> 01:07:18,852
Rabbit-shape dumpling
with shrimp.

574
01:07:24,425 --> 01:07:26,460
I assume you know why I'm here.

575
01:07:26,594 --> 01:07:29,163
- I assume I'm why you're here.
- You are.

576
01:07:29,863 --> 01:07:30,964
She is not.

577
01:07:35,836 --> 01:07:38,072
You can just ignore her.

578
01:07:43,344 --> 01:07:45,579
Maybe we could talk outside.

579
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:48,082
We just got our food.

580
01:07:51,819 --> 01:07:53,687
Her being here won't stop them.

581
01:07:54,555 --> 01:07:56,824
They will go right through her.

582
01:08:01,028 --> 01:08:02,696
No one knows I've seen you yet.

583
01:08:04,398 --> 01:08:06,033
Shouldn't you tell them?

584
01:08:08,636 --> 01:08:10,438
Tell you what.

585
01:08:10,571 --> 01:08:13,107
While she's having dessert,
I'll join you outside.

586
01:08:13,241 --> 01:08:15,376
We'll discuss
what we need to discuss.

587
01:08:16,577 --> 01:08:19,213
How we need to discuss it.

588
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:21,081
How about that?

589
01:08:41,068 --> 01:08:43,103
Can we get to-go boxes, please?

590
01:09:16,704 --> 01:09:18,306
You're gonna let
the monster get him?

591
01:09:19,106 --> 01:09:20,308
A monster.

592
01:09:46,567 --> 01:09:49,803
Hi, Aurora. Can I come in?

593
01:09:51,739 --> 01:09:53,341
My dad's in the living room.

594
01:10:34,548 --> 01:10:36,149
Thanks for coming back so soon.

595
01:10:37,685 --> 01:10:39,987
I apologize for this morning.

596
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:44,157
I hope it all makes sense
once I explain.

597
01:10:44,292 --> 01:10:46,360
- You weren't under the weather.
- No.

598
01:10:47,328 --> 01:10:48,496
Don't touch the floor.

599
01:10:49,730 --> 01:10:51,098
Is it lava?

600
01:10:51,231 --> 01:10:52,666
No, it's not lava.

601
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,235
A monster will eat you
if you touch the floor.

602
01:10:55,369 --> 01:10:56,737
Oh!

603
01:10:56,870 --> 01:10:59,106
I'll consider myself warned.

604
01:11:00,341 --> 01:11:01,542
You'd be the first.

605
01:11:01,675 --> 01:11:03,911
- Erora.
- Aurora.

606
01:11:04,044 --> 01:11:05,613
- Aurora.
- Aurora.

607
01:11:05,746 --> 01:11:08,349
Exactly what I said.
Probably shouldn't indulge her.

608
01:11:08,482 --> 01:11:10,351
She thinks a monster
ate her entire family.

609
01:11:10,484 --> 01:11:12,886
A monster did eat
my entire family.

610
01:11:13,921 --> 01:11:17,358
Go and tuck yourself in.
Just like I showed you.

611
01:12:01,268 --> 01:12:02,670
I have so many thoughts.

612
01:12:02,803 --> 01:12:05,973
Just grab one thought
out of the air.

613
01:12:07,107 --> 01:12:09,343
Grab it as it passes
over your head

614
01:12:09,477 --> 01:12:11,278
and say it out loud.

615
01:12:11,979 --> 01:12:14,348
- Grab it and say it.
- We're all gonna die.

616
01:12:15,082 --> 01:12:16,316
That's a big thought.

617
01:12:16,450 --> 01:12:18,452
I don't believe
that little girl's family

618
01:12:18,586 --> 01:12:19,687
abandoned her.

619
01:12:20,287 --> 01:12:21,822
Not her first family.

620
01:12:21,955 --> 01:12:24,124
Not her second.
Certainly not those last people.

621
01:12:25,493 --> 01:12:27,461
I-I don't think
they all just left.

622
01:12:27,595 --> 01:12:29,863
I think...
I think they're all dead.

623
01:12:30,764 --> 01:12:32,265
- Two families?
- Three.

624
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:33,801
I'm not this girl's father.

625
01:12:33,934 --> 01:12:35,669
I live across the hall, 5B.

626
01:12:35,803 --> 01:12:37,337
- Why did you lie?
- Well, I didn't lie.

627
01:12:37,471 --> 01:12:39,940
That little girl lied.
She's very good at lying.

628
01:12:40,841 --> 01:12:43,143
I just met her, and she told me
a monster ate her parents

629
01:12:43,276 --> 01:12:45,145
and then you rang the bell.

630
01:12:46,246 --> 01:12:47,715
I believe she believes
there is a monster.

631
01:12:47,848 --> 01:12:49,550
I don't think
she's lying about that.

632
01:12:49,683 --> 01:12:52,553
She's just delusional.

633
01:12:53,153 --> 01:12:55,856
But there is something
doing something

634
01:12:56,690 --> 01:12:58,459
and you need to do something
about that.

635
01:13:00,027 --> 01:13:01,895
If there is someone
you can call...

636
01:13:02,029 --> 01:13:03,464
...you should tell them that

637
01:13:03,597 --> 01:13:05,533
circumstances are desperate
and immediate.

638
01:13:05,666 --> 01:13:08,536
You should tell them
that presently, like, now.

639
01:13:08,669 --> 01:13:10,871
Because we are in danger
right now.

640
01:13:11,004 --> 01:13:13,306
You, me,
and that sweet little girl.

641
01:13:13,874 --> 01:13:15,042
Why do you think

642
01:13:15,175 --> 01:13:17,545
we're in danger?

643
01:13:17,678 --> 01:13:19,179
Why did you turn off the lights?

644
01:13:19,312 --> 01:13:20,914
Come here.

645
01:13:24,618 --> 01:13:28,155
They followed her home.
They are watching the building.

646
01:13:29,156 --> 01:13:31,058
Her foster parents are missing.

647
01:13:33,293 --> 01:13:34,895
It all stinks like fish.

648
01:13:37,197 --> 01:13:38,732
Hey, it's Bautista.

649
01:13:40,167 --> 01:13:41,234
Anything going on out there?

650
01:13:42,235 --> 01:13:43,270
Yeah.

651
01:13:43,403 --> 01:13:45,606
Something's going on out here.

652
01:13:52,345 --> 01:13:54,448
- You should get up here.
- Copy that.

653
01:13:54,582 --> 01:13:56,450
I think she saw her parents
getting got

654
01:13:56,584 --> 01:13:58,752
and now it has her
seeing monsters.

655
01:13:58,886 --> 01:14:01,088
And those,
those are the monsters.

656
01:14:02,022 --> 01:14:03,957
She could probably explain this
better in her own words

657
01:14:04,091 --> 01:14:05,559
because it happened to her

658
01:14:05,693 --> 01:14:08,596
and it's got nothing to do
with me.

659
01:14:08,729 --> 01:14:10,197
And I'm guessing...

660
01:14:11,398 --> 01:14:13,133
meanwhile, also completely

661
01:14:13,266 --> 01:14:15,569
unrelated to me...

662
01:14:18,939 --> 01:14:20,207
You gonna get that?

663
01:14:21,408 --> 01:14:22,610
I'm debating.

664
01:14:23,877 --> 01:14:25,312
- You want me to get it?
- No.

665
01:14:28,281 --> 01:14:29,382
I'll get it.

666
01:14:30,417 --> 01:14:31,985
Get off the floor!

667
01:14:32,119 --> 01:14:34,221
Get back
under your special blanket.

668
01:14:46,466 --> 01:14:49,469
Why are you here?

669
01:14:49,603 --> 01:14:51,505
Why are you here?

670
01:14:51,639 --> 01:14:55,275
There are at least
a half-dozen people downstairs

671
01:14:55,408 --> 01:15:00,013
whose purpose this evening
is to turn you into a carcass.

672
01:15:00,147 --> 01:15:01,414
Yeah, well...

673
01:15:01,549 --> 01:15:05,018
And you led them here,
like the Pied Piper.

674
01:15:05,986 --> 01:15:07,087
Did you have a flute?

675
01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:08,856
Not a literal flute.

676
01:15:09,790 --> 01:15:11,024
This is an ambush.

677
01:15:11,158 --> 01:15:13,326
I know. I'm doing the ambushing.

678
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:15,262
I'm the bushwhacker.

679
01:15:15,395 --> 01:15:17,364
And, uh, what they're doing
is less ambush-y

680
01:15:17,497 --> 01:15:18,766
and more of a siege.

681
01:15:18,899 --> 01:15:21,201
Yeah, that kid
ain't gonna survive a siege.

682
01:15:21,334 --> 01:15:23,637
She's fine.
I've got the FBI inside

683
01:15:23,771 --> 01:15:25,606
and they're calling in
reinforcements.

684
01:15:25,739 --> 01:15:27,641
I'm just the concerned neighbor,

685
01:15:27,775 --> 01:15:28,776
5B.

686
01:15:29,577 --> 01:15:30,644
It's perfect.

687
01:15:34,615 --> 01:15:36,817
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

688
01:15:37,651 --> 01:15:39,687
Oh, my God.

689
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:41,054
I've put a lot of thought
into this.

690
01:15:41,188 --> 01:15:43,123
Really? "A lot of thought"?

691
01:15:43,256 --> 01:15:44,992
How are you quantifying
a lot of thought?

692
01:15:45,125 --> 01:15:46,994
By number or quality?

693
01:15:47,127 --> 01:15:49,296
Because I've heard
very few thoughts

694
01:15:49,429 --> 01:15:52,733
and none of them good.

695
01:15:52,866 --> 01:15:55,636
I'm on the verge
if not over the verge,

696
01:15:55,769 --> 01:15:59,172
of convincing them
that disappeared families

697
01:15:59,306 --> 01:16:01,074
are the work of professionals.

698
01:16:01,208 --> 01:16:04,377
So this could tie up
very nicely for me.

699
01:16:04,511 --> 01:16:07,147
I'm getting Peter to kill Paul.

700
01:16:09,482 --> 01:16:11,084
I don't know
how to be any clearer

701
01:16:11,218 --> 01:16:12,485
than I've already been.

702
01:16:13,887 --> 01:16:16,089
You can't save this little girl.

703
01:16:16,223 --> 01:16:18,091
She's seen your face.

704
01:16:18,225 --> 01:16:20,027
She's seen my face.

705
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:21,762
She has to die.

706
01:16:21,895 --> 01:16:25,999
All you can do
is save yourself.

707
01:16:45,585 --> 01:16:47,187
I've done my part.

708
01:17:04,337 --> 01:17:05,873
Fellow concerned neighbor.

709
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:12,379
I'm not with Child
and Family Services.

710
01:17:14,114 --> 01:17:15,816
- Hmm.
- I'm with the FBI.

711
01:17:18,251 --> 01:17:20,087
We've been investigating
the disappearance

712
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:21,722
of Aurora's family.

713
01:17:21,855 --> 01:17:25,258
Families.

714
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:29,830
What is happening
in this poor girl's life

715
01:17:29,963 --> 01:17:31,732
that the FBI is investigating?

716
01:17:34,101 --> 01:17:37,671
Normally, I wouldn't divulge
what we know

717
01:17:37,805 --> 01:17:40,908
but being that
we don't know anything,

718
01:17:41,041 --> 01:17:42,575
I might as well share.

719
01:17:42,710 --> 01:17:44,577
We have one clue.

720
01:17:44,712 --> 01:17:46,947
Something strange
at the first house.

721
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:48,615
How strange?

722
01:17:49,717 --> 01:17:52,652
An open bottle
of thumb-sucking deterrent

723
01:17:52,786 --> 01:17:54,955
on Aurora's nightstand.

724
01:17:55,088 --> 01:17:56,790
Someone was applying it
to her finger

725
01:17:56,924 --> 01:18:00,360
and they vanished
along with the applicator brush,

726
01:18:00,493 --> 01:18:02,195
which was found
under the floorboards

727
01:18:02,329 --> 01:18:03,596
under her bed.

728
01:18:03,731 --> 01:18:06,299
How it got there, no one knows.

729
01:18:07,968 --> 01:18:09,770
Maybe a monster spit it out.

730
01:18:11,471 --> 01:18:12,639
It is a deterrent.

731
01:18:17,845 --> 01:18:19,713
I accidentally touched
the floor.

732
01:18:21,148 --> 01:18:23,216
Don't touch the floor.
It'll eat you.

733
01:18:23,350 --> 01:18:25,452
Get off the floor!

734
01:18:25,585 --> 01:18:28,021
Get off the floor!
Get off the floor!

735
01:18:28,155 --> 01:18:29,456
Get off the floor!

736
01:18:29,589 --> 01:18:30,657
Get off the floor!

737
01:18:30,791 --> 01:18:32,292
- Okay, okay.
- Get off the floor!

738
01:18:36,663 --> 01:18:40,667
Jesus!

739
01:18:41,634 --> 01:18:43,370
She really believes in it.

740
01:18:44,037 --> 01:18:45,038
Yeah.

741
01:18:46,106 --> 01:18:47,307
I can see that.

742
01:18:55,883 --> 01:18:58,485
Get under your special covers.

743
01:18:58,618 --> 01:19:00,821
Don't come out again
until I tell you so.

744
01:19:05,525 --> 01:19:08,161
Get off the floor!

745
01:19:10,697 --> 01:19:12,032
That's not funny.

746
01:19:19,206 --> 01:19:20,340
It's coming to get you!

747
01:19:20,473 --> 01:19:21,408
Shut up!

748
01:19:23,877 --> 01:19:25,078
Where are you?

749
01:19:25,245 --> 01:19:27,547
We're inside.
Almost there.

750
01:19:29,549 --> 01:19:31,919
Is that you?

751
01:20:15,095 --> 01:20:21,001
Who...

752
01:20:21,134 --> 01:20:22,402
shot me?

753
01:20:54,167 --> 01:20:56,536
Give me that.

754
01:20:56,669 --> 01:20:57,938
How many outside?

755
01:20:58,071 --> 01:20:59,606
I counted two.

756
01:20:59,739 --> 01:21:01,841
And how many inside?

757
01:21:01,975 --> 01:21:03,776
I counted two.

758
01:21:36,109 --> 01:21:37,510
Give me my gun back.

759
01:21:47,354 --> 01:21:50,657
Ow.

760
01:22:32,699 --> 01:22:34,134
Maybe get off the floor.

761
01:23:09,936 --> 01:23:12,005
There's an animal in here.

762
01:23:12,139 --> 01:23:13,273
There's a what?

763
01:23:13,906 --> 01:23:16,576
Something big.

764
01:25:18,831 --> 01:25:20,133
Don't...

765
01:25:20,267 --> 01:25:21,601
...do it.

766
01:25:35,515 --> 01:25:36,616
What is that?

767
01:25:39,919 --> 01:25:42,722
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

768
01:25:42,855 --> 01:25:45,658
Oh, my God! What is happening?
What's happening?

769
01:25:45,792 --> 01:25:48,261
What's happening?

770
01:27:22,789 --> 01:27:26,058
I think that's the monster
that lives under Aurora's bed.

771
01:27:28,995 --> 01:27:29,862
Uh-huh.

772
01:27:32,799 --> 01:27:34,434
- FBI!
- Get on the ground now!

773
01:27:35,234 --> 01:27:36,436
Drop your weapon!

774
01:27:36,569 --> 01:27:38,505
Get on the floor now!

775
01:27:39,872 --> 01:27:40,940
Down on the floor!

776
01:27:41,073 --> 01:27:42,742
- Uh, no. No.
- No. I-I can't do that.

777
01:27:42,875 --> 01:27:44,076
I'm sorry. No,
it's not gonna happen. No.

778
01:27:44,210 --> 01:27:45,612
Down on the floor!

779
01:27:45,745 --> 01:27:48,548
There is something
in the floor!

780
01:27:51,651 --> 01:27:54,587
Concerned neighbor, 5B.

781
01:28:00,393 --> 01:28:02,228
- You got the girl?
- I got the girl.

782
01:28:04,063 --> 01:28:07,066
I-I would like to sincerely
apologize for my tone earlier.

783
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:08,735
It wasn't professional.
Please, can we leave?

784
01:28:08,868 --> 01:28:10,269
- Time to go. We gotta go.
- We gotta go. I gotta go.

785
01:28:10,403 --> 01:28:11,938
Let's go. Take me off the floor.

786
01:28:12,071 --> 01:28:13,406
Why aren't we going to the car?

787
01:28:13,540 --> 01:28:14,707
When we get to the car...

788
01:28:14,841 --> 01:28:16,576
Get them up
and get them out of here.

789
01:28:16,709 --> 01:28:17,710
There's something in the floor.

790
01:28:17,844 --> 01:28:19,045
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no.

791
01:28:19,178 --> 01:28:21,213
Oh, my God!
There's something in the floor.

792
01:28:21,348 --> 01:28:22,482
Something in the floor.

793
01:28:22,615 --> 01:28:24,216
There's something in the floor.

794
01:28:24,351 --> 01:28:25,652
Something in the floor.

795
01:28:25,785 --> 01:28:28,955
Something in the floor.
There's something...

796
01:29:19,639 --> 01:29:20,640
Erora.

797
01:29:24,444 --> 01:29:25,712
Erora!

798
01:29:28,915 --> 01:29:30,016
Aurora.

799
01:29:38,858 --> 01:29:41,293
Did it eat everybody?

800
01:29:41,428 --> 01:29:43,396
Not everybody.

801
01:29:43,530 --> 01:29:44,864
Just everybody else.

802
01:29:46,032 --> 01:29:48,334
No, stay. Stay where you are.

803
01:29:53,673 --> 01:29:54,841
You believe me now?

804
01:29:58,778 --> 01:30:01,881
Yes.

805
01:30:02,014 --> 01:30:04,751
Are you the happiest
you've ever been?

806
01:30:07,554 --> 01:30:09,188
Happy is not the word I'll use.

807
01:30:16,395 --> 01:30:19,365
We go through the window,
down the fire escape.

808
01:30:24,904 --> 01:30:26,105
Ready?

809
01:31:09,081 --> 01:31:10,382
I told you so.

810
01:32:28,628 --> 01:32:31,698
I didn't taste too good.

811
01:33:14,707 --> 01:33:16,108
Hello, Aurora.

812
01:33:17,744 --> 01:33:22,348
Don't come in here.

813
01:33:22,481 --> 01:33:24,617
I've come to rescue Aurora.

814
01:33:25,584 --> 01:33:27,754
Aurora, you can't stay here.

815
01:33:27,887 --> 01:33:29,221
It's not safe.

816
01:33:32,058 --> 01:33:33,559
Come with me.

817
01:33:34,226 --> 01:33:36,696
I'll take care of you.

818
01:33:39,231 --> 01:33:40,633
Get off the floor.

819
01:33:44,236 --> 01:33:47,473
You don't have to do
what you think you have to do.

820
01:33:47,606 --> 01:33:49,408
But you do have to get off
the floor.

821
01:33:49,541 --> 01:33:50,710
Aurora...

822
01:33:52,211 --> 01:33:54,213
be easier for you
than it is for him.

823
01:33:54,346 --> 01:33:55,915
Mom, get off the floor.

824
01:33:56,048 --> 01:33:59,418
Don't call me that.
It's hurtful.

825
01:33:59,551 --> 01:34:00,720
It's going to eat you.

826
01:34:02,521 --> 01:34:04,590
What's going to eat me, Aurora?

827
01:35:03,115 --> 01:35:04,851
Mom...

828
01:36:28,267 --> 01:36:29,969
It doesn't wanna eat you,
Aurora.

829
01:36:32,071 --> 01:36:35,074
It's your monster.

830
01:36:36,876 --> 01:36:38,210
It's my monster.

831
01:36:42,048 --> 01:36:45,117
You wished for it.

832
01:36:45,251 --> 01:36:47,786
You have to live with it.

833
01:36:50,857 --> 01:36:52,224
I wished for you too.

834
01:37:00,532 --> 01:37:02,401
We're going away now, Aurora.

835
01:37:03,702 --> 01:37:05,337
You can't even say my name.

836
01:37:06,405 --> 01:37:09,141
And I don't even know your name.

837
01:37:11,310 --> 01:37:13,012
You'll think of something
to call me.

838
01:37:15,481 --> 01:37:17,516
And I'll just call you
"little girl."

839
01:37:20,452 --> 01:37:23,122

I want to be on the ground with you.

If you can take the high ground,
then I can make sure you're protected.

25

Very true. From this spot,
I can watch for the wretched scum

Good thinking, General Yoshi.

These villains. These rats.

35

The same as always, Lord Kitaro.

36

Nothing less than their heads!

All of my fear.

188
01:08:47,833 --> 01:08:49,792
All of my joy.

189
01:08:50,667 --> 01:08:52,458
All of my laughter

190
01:08:52,542 --> 01:08:54,292
and all of my tears.

191
01:08:56,708 --> 01:08:59,333
Everything that I am

192
01:08:59,417 --> 01:09:02,417
and all that I never will be.

193
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,667
I miss my family.

194
01:09:21,083 --> 01:09:22,583
To live.

195
01:09:23,625 --> 01:09:25,208
To love.

196
01:09:26,167 --> 01:09:27,625
To play.

197
01:09:28,625 --> 01:09:30,125
To dance.

198
01:10:00,833 --> 01:10:02,000
[speaking native language]

199
01:13:36,625 --> 01:13:38,542
I can taste it.

200
01:13:39,333 --> 01:13:41,750
Can you taste it?

201
01:13:45,792 --> 01:13:48,500
Let me. Please.

202
01:13:48,583 --> 01:13:51,042
Let me play with him.

203
01:13:54,792 --> 01:13:57,042
Let you play?

204
01:14:24,583 --> 01:14:26,417
[speaking native language]

205
01:17:07,042 --> 01:17:08,042
[speaking native language]

206
01:18:17,625 --> 01:18:20,292
Get out there, old man.

207
01:18:21,125 --> 01:18:23,125
Show me the man...

208
01:18:23,875 --> 01:18:25,875
you once were.

209
01:18:26,792 --> 01:18:31,000
The man my father
used to tell stories about.

210
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:23,417
I knew that you were different!

211
01:19:24,875 --> 01:19:27,000
So you're next.

3
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,500
<i>May I be happy</i>

4
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:28,000
<i>May I be happy</i>

5
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:33,250
<i>May I be free from suffering</i>

6
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,833
<i>May I be free from enmity</i>

7
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:44,666
<i>May I be free from obstacles and dangers</i>

8
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,625
<i>May I live in peace and happily</i>

9
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:52,625
<i>Maintain purity in body and speech</i>

10
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:55,666
<i>Free from all suffering and danger</i>

11
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:09,333
What brought you up here?
What have you done?

12
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:30,041
RAMPA ISLAND, CHONBURI, 1976 CE

13
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:44,666
Aim!

14
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,375
How are you? Are you doing well?

15
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:54,916
I haven't been here for a month,
and missed you so much!

16
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,666
Here,

17
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,625
everyone is responsible for their own.

18
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:13,250
I've got good news.

19
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:17,375
Mother said I'll be released soon.

20
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:19,208
Really?

21
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,166
They're working
on the paperwork right now.

22
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,625
So until then,
you'll come and get me from here, right?

23
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:34,291
Go line up quickly.

24
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,375
Mother is coming down.

25
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:24,083
My name is Ms. Pritsana,
I'm in charge here.

26
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:27,375
Everyone here calls me "Mother."

27
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,708
Introduce yourself to your friends.

28
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:50,791
I'm Ingkhwan, from Darunphorn youth home.

29
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,291
Ingkhwan,

30
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,041
a true Northerner.

31
00:04:56,916 --> 00:05:01,125
Silence! What's everyone laughing at?
We're in front of Mother, remember.

32
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:06,416
We're on an island and it's just us here.

33
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,625
It's essential to have rules.

34
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,375
I would like each of you

35
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:17,250
to assist Ingkhwan in becoming familiar
with our regulations here.

36
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,416
Please look after her, Aim-orn.

37
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,583
Yes, Mother.

38
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:36,000
Please take care of her, Maprang.
I'll be back.

39
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,458
Return to your work now!

40
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:43,375
Nuch,

41
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,500
take the new student to the building.

42
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:57,666
PINITKHUN REFORMATORY SCHOOL
AREA FOR YOUTH CIVIC DEVELOPMENT

43
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:13,916
We don't have a backup small boat here
like you might think.

44
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,916
I'm happy to Mother with anything.

45
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,375
Just give me some food
and a place to sleep, and I'm good.

46
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:29,500
As for the radio
I asked you to get repaired last time,

47
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:32,541
you couldn't handle fixing that.

48
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,000
Yet you're asking to stay.

49
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,375
If an emergency comes up,

50
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,958
it'll be a problem for everyone.

51
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:54,291
The next boat won't come
until the storm is over.

52
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,875
In the meantime,
you can stay at the lighthouse.

53
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,125
Thank you, Mother.

54
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,000
Come in.

55
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,875
You two can leave now.

56
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,125
"Miss Ingkhwan Pornraksa,

57
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:22,916
age 17, sent here due to…"

58
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:41,875
I do not care
what you have done before.

59
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,541
At this school,

60
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:51,083
we're ready to give everyone a chance
to turn their life around.

61
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:57,250
You want a fresh start, don't you?

62
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:41,416
{\an8}The government closed
a secret island prison

63
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:51,208
Mystery on island: Dozens of prisoners
found dead.

64
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,041
{\an8}The Interior Minister
plans to convert the prison

65
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:11,916
{\an8}into a reformer school
for young female offenders.

66
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:16,208
PINITKHUN REFORMATORY SCHOOL

67
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,375
THE GUARDIAN ANGEL
OF PINITKHUN SCHOOL

68
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:08,000
Your job is now to light the dorm lantern
every evening.

69
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,125
Refill the water every day.

70
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:13,208
Everyone here must wake up before sunrise,

71
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,458
attend classes on time,

72
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:18,208
and be in the dormitory
by 7:00 p.m. sharp.

73
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:22,708
If you want to push the rules,
be my guest.

74
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:38,166
Wish the dorm had electricity
instead of lanterns.

75
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,250
I'm jealous of Mother's room
with it's proper lamp.

76
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:53,625
If you don't like it,
feel free to sleep on the floor.

77
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,666
No one's stopping you.

78
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,541
But since you're alone,

79
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,125
you'd better watch out.

80
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,791
Especially at night.

81
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,125
Who's there?

82
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,708
Don't forget to wash it, it's filthy!

83
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:51,625
Isn't this too much?

84
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:56,791
This filthy bitch's job now?
Shoveling shit for you now.

85
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:22,166
Every plate of rice and every bit of food,

86
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:26,291
don't waste it, they're precious.

87
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:30,166
Many people are starving.

88
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:34,125
Always remember all the starving children.

89
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,750
When you're making a garland,

90
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,625
you must take care with each flower.

91
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:43,041
Just one out of place,

92
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:47,625
the whole garland won't look right.

93
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,416
Come on, I'll help.

94
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,166
If you can't handle it,
why not ask for help?

95
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,625
When you have time, stop by the infirmary.

96
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,416
Put some antiseptic on your wound.

97
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:53,541
If something is bothering you,
feel free to tell me.

98
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:57,166
Just think me of as one of your friends.

99
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,750
I'm here for you.

100
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,875
So have you seen the ghost?

101
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Who's there?

102
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,333
Who's there?

103
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,416
Enough with the pranks!

104
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:17,750
I'm not scared!

105
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:45,750
<i>Next time, you'll be finished.</i>

106
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,375
Carving…

107
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:08,875
is a craft that requires focus
and precision.

108
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Because it can transform
something ordinary or unattractive

109
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,291
into something beautiful.

110
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:19,166
What happened last night?

111
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,791
Nothing, Mother.

112
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:31,500
Will you take care of this
or must I enforce order myself?

113
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,083
Last night, it was you!

114
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:58,375
What?

115
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,208
Don't play innocent.

116
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:02,416
You're the one
who pushed Aim down the stairs.

117
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:06,666
Admit it! We won't tell Mother.

118
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,958
I didn't do it.

119
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,791
Just admit you did it.

120
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:16,250
Let go of me.

121
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:17,750
Let go of me.

122
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,833
Let go of me.

123
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:38,416
You saw that, right?
She's the one who did it.

124
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:40,375
But…

125
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:43,166
I didn't see Ing do anything.

126
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,208
Of course you'll take her side.
You're both country bumpkins.

127
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:54,708
If you don't own up,
everyone else will take the fall.

128
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:56,916
But honestly, I didn't do it.

129
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:01,708
No meal for you all tonight.

130
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:03,708
Get back to work now.

131
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:08,458
Make more excuses
and they will be punished because of you.

132
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,833
I'm sorry that I was a coward.

133
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:38,166
You can be mad at me.

134
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:43,125
But I believe you didn't hurt Maprang.

135
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:51,375
Aim said you're a bumpkin.

136
00:23:53,791 --> 00:23:55,500
Are you from the North too?

137
00:23:58,083 --> 00:23:59,333
Yes.

138
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,458
I'm Ploy.

139
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:05,000
I thought you wouldn't talk to me.

140
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:09,708
You always keep to yourself.

141
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:13,666
This is how it is here.

142
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:18,291
Those who have been here longer like Aim

143
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,791
always bully the newcomers.

144
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:25,208
and Mother allows it.

145
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:29,250
<i>But we all think the same,</i>

146
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:32,916
<i>that if we keep our heads down,</i>

147
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:36,250
<i>at least we'll have a place to stay.</i>

148
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,750
As you know,

149
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:44,500
the girls don't have a home to go back to.

150
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,625
Aim, what brings you here?

151
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:08,125
When you picked up the new girl,
did you talk to her?

152
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:11,208
I asked for her name and where she's from.

153
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:13,333
What did she say?

154
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,333
Nothing.

155
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:19,458
On the mainland,

156
00:25:20,416 --> 00:25:23,666
have you heard of Darunphorn Home?

157
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:27,000
Darunphorn Home?

158
00:25:28,166 --> 00:25:29,000
Yes.

159
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:31,333
It's an orphanage.

160
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:35,958
I saw in the news.
It got closed down all of a sudden.

161
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,583
<i>Introduce yourself.</i>

162
00:26:09,958 --> 00:26:13,208
- Country bumpkin!
- Country bumpkin!

163
00:26:13,291 --> 00:26:14,375
Strip her.

164
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:15,416
No.

165
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,416
No.

166
00:27:09,208 --> 00:27:10,041
What is it?

167
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:15,291
You, come here.

168
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:17,208
What?

169
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,333
Let go.

170
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:23,291
- Let go of me.
- Stop squirming.

171
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:27,500
A stupid bumpkin like you
never learns their lesson!

172
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:43,083
Please don't hurt me.

173
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:46,083
I'm begging you.

174
00:27:51,833 --> 00:27:52,750
No.

175
00:28:08,666 --> 00:28:10,208
There's still some shit here.

176
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,583
No.

177
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:15,375
No!

178
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:21,458
Aim, what's wrong?

179
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,250
What happened?

180
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:40,000
You saw it, right?

181
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,750
What?

182
00:30:46,416 --> 00:30:47,250
An old woman.

183
00:30:48,791 --> 00:30:49,625
Is it…

184
00:30:50,916 --> 00:30:51,750
a ghost?

185
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:53,166
Nonsense, Nuch.

186
00:30:53,791 --> 00:30:54,958
Don't scare her.

187
00:30:56,166 --> 00:30:57,333
She looks pale now.

188
00:31:03,875 --> 00:31:05,208
What happened, Aim?

189
00:31:28,791 --> 00:31:32,250
Did someone hurt you?

190
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:37,416
Are you gonna say it?

191
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:39,750
Let go of me.

192
00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:41,666
Say it!

193
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:44,250
Okay.

194
00:31:46,458 --> 00:31:47,291
Now, say it.

195
00:31:48,583 --> 00:31:49,416
You know something

196
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:51,083
I don't know, don't you?

197
00:31:59,416 --> 00:32:00,458
I…

198
00:32:01,958 --> 00:32:04,458
I think that ghost
has something to do with Ing.

199
00:32:05,666 --> 00:32:06,500
How?

200
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:07,958
I don't follow.

201
00:32:08,791 --> 00:32:12,291
Something happened to me
after I dumped shit on her,

202
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,083
you know that?

203
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:33,875
Have you all

204
00:32:35,166 --> 00:32:36,916
heard of "a godmother ghost"?

205
00:32:48,291 --> 00:32:51,291
<i>When I was young,</i>
<i>my grandma told me that</i>

206
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:54,250
<i>everyone is born, molded by spirits.</i>

207
00:32:58,583 --> 00:33:02,250
<i>Most northern people believe</i>

208
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:05,791
<i>a newborn is guarded by a ghost</i>

209
00:33:06,416 --> 00:33:08,000
<i>as if it were another mother.</i>

210
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:15,458
So, the newborn

211
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:19,458
is like a human's and a ghost's child.

212
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,541
So, we have a ritual
to buy it off from the ghost.

213
00:34:07,791 --> 00:34:11,500
A ghost's child for three days,
a human's child for four days.

214
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:14,416
Whoever this child belongs to,
come to take it.

215
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,041
Come! Take it and raise it!

216
00:34:34,708 --> 00:34:36,791
I'd like to buy off this child.

217
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:10,791
The baby belongs to human now.

218
00:36:11,458 --> 00:36:14,500
No ghost can disturb her.

219
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,625
No ghost can take her.

220
00:36:18,666 --> 00:36:19,791
Keep this doll's head

221
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:22,416
with your child all the time

222
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:24,500
until she's mature.

223
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:27,791
Don't mess around.

224
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,375
Do it properly,

225
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:31,291
or bad things may happen.

226
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:32,333
Keep that in mind.

227
00:36:35,916 --> 00:36:38,041
<i>Any child that has never</i>
<i>been in that ritual</i>

228
00:36:39,916 --> 00:36:42,791
will be taken by the ghost

229
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,416
or it may stay with her.

230
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:53,000
What haunted us is her godmother ghost?

231
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,500
Sounds like just a folk tale.

232
00:36:56,958 --> 00:36:58,041
Interesting.

233
00:37:01,791 --> 00:37:02,958
I just don't buy it.

234
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:50,958
Who's there?

235
00:38:49,416 --> 00:38:51,000
- Help!
- Quiet.

236
00:38:51,541 --> 00:38:52,875
Help!

237
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:55,416
- Help!
- Shut up. Be quiet now.

238
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,666
Help!

239
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,291
- Help!
- Be quiet.

240
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,666
What's all the noise?

241
00:39:05,791 --> 00:39:07,375
I heard you're quite competent.

242
00:39:08,791 --> 00:39:10,958
Prove it to me.

243
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:21,708
Look at you.

244
00:39:22,916 --> 00:39:24,875
What can you do to me in this state?

245
00:39:31,416 --> 00:39:32,458
Let me go!

246
00:39:33,041 --> 00:39:34,375
Please!

247
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:41,541
You're squirming just like a worm.

248
00:39:42,041 --> 00:39:43,125
You worthless scum.

249
00:39:46,666 --> 00:39:47,583
Let me go!

250
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:59,083
I forgot you're filthier than shit.

251
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:01,750
Let me wipe my feet.

252
00:40:05,125 --> 00:40:06,000
Get off of me!

253
00:40:06,958 --> 00:40:08,041
Are you angry?

254
00:40:09,833 --> 00:40:12,833
Why? You're mad at me?

255
00:40:19,541 --> 00:40:21,750
So mad that you want to kill me?

256
00:40:22,458 --> 00:40:24,625
Go on. Kill me.

257
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:35,166
Let me go.

258
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:38,041
Please.

259
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:01,000
Keep your damn mouth shut about this.

260
00:41:02,708 --> 00:41:03,708
If anyone finds out,

261
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:06,541
they'll suffer the same fate.

262
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,333
Can you take me out of here, Pin?

263
00:41:30,083 --> 00:41:31,375
I don't want to be here.

264
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:42,500
Why not?

265
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:49,958
I just want to start my life over.

266
00:42:00,708 --> 00:42:01,958
I really can't help you.

267
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:05,541
I can't even find a way
to contact the mainland.

268
00:42:05,625 --> 00:42:06,458
Please.

269
00:42:08,458 --> 00:42:10,000
No one else can help me.

270
00:42:10,583 --> 00:42:11,458
I'm sorry, Ing.

271
00:42:12,875 --> 00:42:14,333
You should leave

272
00:42:14,416 --> 00:42:16,500
before someone sees you here.
You'll be punished.

273
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,333
This is for the rain.

274
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:53,208
The reason you're here
is to learn to be a better person.

275
00:42:54,083 --> 00:42:57,250
It's not to behave like whore,
chasing after a guy.

276
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:16,708
Keep in mind,

277
00:43:17,708 --> 00:43:19,791
if you still behave like you used to,

278
00:43:19,875 --> 00:43:21,750
if you still misbehave,

279
00:43:22,583 --> 00:43:26,750
don't expect any leniency from me
or that I will let you leave this place.

280
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:30,708
Worthless scum like you

281
00:43:32,333 --> 00:43:34,375
won't be accepted by the society.

282
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:08,666
No, let go!

283
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,041
Mother.

284
00:47:13,125 --> 00:47:16,791
It's me, Aim. It's me, Mother.

285
00:47:17,916 --> 00:47:18,833
It's Aim.

286
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:26,041
What happened, Mother?

287
00:47:32,208 --> 00:47:33,583
What happened to you?

288
00:47:59,583 --> 00:48:00,458
Ing.

289
00:48:01,083 --> 00:48:01,958
Ing.

290
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:05,750
Could you walk with me to the bathroom?

291
00:48:47,208 --> 00:48:49,833
If she has been in the ritual,

292
00:48:50,875 --> 00:48:52,833
she should have a doll's head.

293
00:48:54,125 --> 00:48:55,333
But if she hasn't…

294
00:49:03,125 --> 00:49:06,208
Actually, I want to talk to you.

295
00:49:07,458 --> 00:49:08,333
Go on.

296
00:49:10,208 --> 00:49:15,083
Aim thought I can talk to you.

297
00:49:16,875 --> 00:49:20,083
So, she forced me to tell your story.

298
00:49:22,166 --> 00:49:23,000
About what?

299
00:49:25,958 --> 00:49:29,583
About your godmother ghost.

300
00:49:32,291 --> 00:49:34,583
If we find it, what would we do?

301
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:40,000
Let's find it first.
She might not have a doll's head.

302
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,000
And what do they think?

303
00:50:15,875 --> 00:50:16,708
Well,

304
00:50:17,958 --> 00:50:18,833
they don't buy it.

305
00:50:20,125 --> 00:50:22,958
She thinks you did all that.

306
00:50:24,083 --> 00:50:25,500
As long as you're here,

307
00:50:26,375 --> 00:50:28,958
they'll keep giving you trouble.

308
00:51:33,708 --> 00:51:35,458
What does it mean, Aim?

309
00:51:36,375 --> 00:51:37,583
Ploy has only the head.

310
00:51:49,125 --> 00:51:49,958
Leave.

311
00:52:03,875 --> 00:52:04,708
What's going on?

312
00:52:10,958 --> 00:52:11,833
Say it.

313
00:52:17,208 --> 00:52:20,833
Ing has been missing since this morning.

314
00:52:26,958 --> 00:52:27,833
Ing.

315
00:52:29,083 --> 00:52:29,958
Are you here?

316
00:52:40,625 --> 00:52:42,541
Where are you, Ingkhwan?

317
00:52:42,625 --> 00:52:43,625
- Ingkhwan.
- Ingkhwan.

318
00:52:43,708 --> 00:52:44,583
Where are you?

319
00:52:45,291 --> 00:52:46,583
Ingkhwan, where are you?

320
00:53:07,208 --> 00:53:09,000
Hiding here and not caring about anything.

321
00:53:09,708 --> 00:53:12,208
What are you plotting, bumpkin?

322
00:53:13,458 --> 00:53:14,708
I just want to be alone.

323
00:53:16,375 --> 00:53:17,750
Please leave me alone.

324
00:53:34,333 --> 00:53:35,375
You want to be alone?

325
00:53:40,458 --> 00:53:42,250
What are you doing? Let go.

326
00:53:42,333 --> 00:53:43,541
We're helping you.

327
00:53:43,625 --> 00:53:44,500
Let go.

328
00:53:44,583 --> 00:53:46,666
- You want to be alone, right?
- Let go.

329
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:48,458
Let me go.

330
00:53:50,958 --> 00:53:51,875
Let go.

331
00:53:51,958 --> 00:53:52,833
Shut up.

332
00:53:53,958 --> 00:53:56,291
Let me go. I'm begging you.

333
00:53:56,375 --> 00:53:58,291
Please!

334
00:53:58,375 --> 00:53:59,500
Shut up.

335
00:53:59,583 --> 00:54:00,458
Let go!

336
00:54:10,708 --> 00:54:11,750
Please don't hurt me.

337
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:44,125
Since you want to be alone,

338
00:54:45,125 --> 00:54:46,708
try to stay here overnight.

339
00:54:48,208 --> 00:54:49,375
But if you want out,

340
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:53,375
try calling your ghost mom for help.

341
00:54:53,458 --> 00:54:55,583
Don't!

342
00:54:56,458 --> 00:54:57,333
<i>Don't!</i>

343
00:55:08,583 --> 00:55:10,875
- Ingkhwan.
- Can you hear me?

344
00:55:10,958 --> 00:55:12,125
- Ingkhwan.
- Ingkhwan.

345
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:13,416
- Ingkhwan.
- Ingkhwan.

346
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:16,875
Aim. What if what Ploy said is true?

347
00:55:17,958 --> 00:55:18,833
The godmother ghost.

348
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:29,000
Hey, Ploy.

349
00:55:29,583 --> 00:55:30,708
Guys, Ploy fainted.

350
00:55:32,083 --> 00:55:33,000
Ploy!

351
00:55:35,083 --> 00:55:36,000
What's going on?

352
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:39,333
Don't say anything. I'll handle this.

353
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,708
It's just Ingkhwan ran away.

354
00:55:49,333 --> 00:55:50,833
So I asked them to find her.

355
00:55:52,833 --> 00:55:53,750
Since when?

356
00:55:55,791 --> 00:55:56,666
We don't know.

357
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:01,958
If she could get away,

358
00:56:02,583 --> 00:56:05,333
you know who will be responsible, right?

359
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:50,458
Where are you going?

360
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:52,625
To look for Ing.

361
00:56:54,333 --> 00:56:55,708
Why would you do that?

362
00:56:56,583 --> 00:56:58,208
She could be anywhere by now.

363
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:00,208
She can't follow the rules.

364
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,958
I don't see anyone else having a problem.

365
00:57:05,708 --> 00:57:07,958
We all want to get out of here, don't we?

366
00:57:12,958 --> 00:57:14,291
- Ingkhwan.
- Ingkhwan.

367
00:57:14,375 --> 00:57:17,125
Ingkhwan, where are you?

368
00:57:17,208 --> 00:57:19,166
- Ing.
- Can you hear me?

369
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:21,791
- Can you hear me?
- Ingkhwan.

370
00:57:21,875 --> 00:57:24,250
- Ingkhwan.
- Where are you?

371
00:57:24,333 --> 00:57:25,958
- Can you hear me?
- Ingkhwan.

372
00:57:26,041 --> 00:57:27,458
- Ingkhwan.
- Ingkhwan.

373
00:57:27,541 --> 00:57:30,375
- Ingkhwan.
- Where are you?

374
00:57:34,791 --> 00:57:35,750
Ingkhwan.

375
00:57:36,708 --> 00:57:38,041
Can you hear me?

376
00:57:38,125 --> 00:57:40,500
- Ingkhwan.
- Ingkhwan.

377
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:42,666
Somebody

378
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:43,875
help me!

379
00:57:43,958 --> 00:57:46,083
Ingkhwan, can you hear me?

380
00:57:46,833 --> 00:57:48,250
- Ingkhwan.
- Can you hear me?

381
00:57:49,125 --> 00:57:50,500
Help!

382
00:57:56,083 --> 00:57:57,375
Help!

383
00:58:04,958 --> 00:58:06,000
Help!

384
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,000
<i>Ing…</i>

385
00:58:34,916 --> 00:58:38,291
<i>Let me help you.</i>

386
00:58:42,916 --> 00:58:47,416
<i>Let me kill them like always.</i>

387
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:55,750
<i>Ing…</i>

388
00:59:11,208 --> 00:59:12,125
Ing!

389
00:59:21,125 --> 00:59:21,958
Ing.

390
00:59:33,541 --> 00:59:34,458
Ing.

391
01:00:11,083 --> 01:00:13,500
Today, you will all work as usual.

392
01:00:14,625 --> 01:00:16,208
No need to look for Ingkhwan.

393
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:21,458
It's nobody's fault

394
01:00:22,375 --> 01:00:26,458
but the one who chose
to break the rules here.

395
01:00:27,208 --> 01:00:28,250
If she gets caught,

396
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:31,125
she'll be severely punished

397
01:00:32,208 --> 01:00:34,208
to set an example.

398
01:00:57,708 --> 01:00:59,250
You ran off and stayed with Pin?

399
01:00:59,333 --> 01:01:01,208
We looked everywhere for you.

400
01:01:02,208 --> 01:01:03,083
It was you girls

401
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:05,833
who threw me in the pit.

402
01:01:05,916 --> 01:01:07,375
- What?
- What?

403
01:01:12,958 --> 01:01:13,833
It's you

404
01:01:13,916 --> 01:01:16,333
who ran away
and are blaming someone else now.

405
01:01:16,416 --> 01:01:18,041
It's the truth.

406
01:01:18,125 --> 01:01:19,041
I found her.

407
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:25,375
- You're lying, bumpkin!
- Maprang.

408
01:01:25,458 --> 01:01:28,500
You can't follow the rules,
so you hid and waited to escape,

409
01:01:28,583 --> 01:01:30,666
- got caught and blaming others!
- Quiet!

410
01:01:38,625 --> 01:01:40,375
I don't believe anyone for now.

411
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,625
About who is to blame,
I'll investigate and punish them later.

412
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,458
Meanwhile, no more trouble.

413
01:01:54,541 --> 01:01:55,375
Go!

414
01:02:01,708 --> 01:02:03,333
Did Maprang really do it?

415
01:02:26,458 --> 01:02:31,208
Was all of this really Maprang's doing?

416
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:38,125
You're so lucky to have made it out alive.

417
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:44,958
Ploy.

418
01:02:51,875 --> 01:02:54,583
You've been working with them all along,
haven't you?

419
01:03:03,833 --> 01:03:07,041
I'm sorry.

420
01:03:09,083 --> 01:03:11,875
Do weaklings like us

421
01:03:11,958 --> 01:03:14,541
really have another choice?

422
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:51,458
Cute.

423
01:04:52,666 --> 01:04:54,375
Adorable.

424
01:05:17,208 --> 01:05:18,125
Shut up!

425
01:05:18,208 --> 01:05:19,083
I said shut up.

426
01:05:21,916 --> 01:05:24,041
- Ing!
- Ing!

427
01:05:24,125 --> 01:05:26,000
Hurry up or her parents will find out.

428
01:05:26,083 --> 01:05:27,625
Ing, where are you?

429
01:06:05,208 --> 01:06:07,125
Ing!

430
01:06:08,375 --> 01:06:10,416
- Ing.
- Ing.

431
01:06:12,583 --> 01:06:13,833
- Ing.
- Ing.

432
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:15,666
- Ing.
- Ing.

433
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:16,833
Ing.

434
01:06:28,208 --> 01:06:30,500
<i>Whoever hurt my child,</i>

435
01:06:31,916 --> 01:06:34,291
<i>I will kill them.</i>

436
01:07:51,833 --> 01:07:52,708
<i>Aim.</i>

437
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:54,875
Aim.

438
01:07:55,375 --> 01:07:56,458
Aim.

439
01:07:57,250 --> 01:07:58,458
Aim.

440
01:07:58,958 --> 01:08:00,250
Aim, wake up.

441
01:08:05,458 --> 01:08:06,791
Something horrible happened.

442
01:08:08,958 --> 01:08:10,250
What's going on?

443
01:08:10,333 --> 01:08:11,958
Why did Nuch have to get her?

444
01:08:12,458 --> 01:08:13,583
Where's Maprang?

445
01:08:14,583 --> 01:08:15,583
Aim.

446
01:08:56,833 --> 01:08:58,291
What happened?

447
01:09:05,916 --> 01:09:07,166
What happened?

448
01:09:21,958 --> 01:09:26,708
Can someone go get Pin
to take care of Maprang's body?

449
01:09:37,458 --> 01:09:39,250
The godmother ghost did this.

450
01:09:40,458 --> 01:09:44,208
Ing told me that
she's coming for everyone.

451
01:10:00,208 --> 01:10:01,625
It was you, wasn't it?

452
01:10:01,708 --> 01:10:03,083
Did you kill my friend?

453
01:10:04,583 --> 01:10:05,958
Aim, enough.

454
01:10:17,625 --> 01:10:20,750
If you think it was me,

455
01:10:22,375 --> 01:10:23,666
go ahead and deal with me.

456
01:10:27,416 --> 01:10:28,875
Do you dare?

457
01:11:09,583 --> 01:11:11,333
<i>Once the storm is over,</i>

458
01:11:11,833 --> 01:11:15,375
<i>do whatever it takes</i>
<i>to get Ingkhwan out of here</i>

459
01:11:16,958 --> 01:11:18,958
and don't come back here again.

460
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:27,541
There's a broken radio
in the storage behind the school,

461
01:11:27,625 --> 01:11:29,291
along with some spare fuel.

462
01:11:29,375 --> 01:11:31,958
You may take them all.

463
01:11:32,916 --> 01:11:34,083
Leave now.

464
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:38,083
And you stay and talk to me.

465
01:11:52,208 --> 01:11:54,625
What happened at Darunphorn?

466
01:12:00,958 --> 01:12:04,458
When people enter the island,
Mother always has them bring a newspaper.

467
01:12:04,958 --> 01:12:07,750
There may be some news or info
about that bumpkin girl.

468
01:12:08,625 --> 01:12:11,125
I doubt we'll find anything.

469
01:12:11,208 --> 01:12:14,958
Even if we do,
I can't read it anyway.

470
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:19,625
She must've done some horrible things
to end up here.

471
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,333
My parents died…

472
01:12:31,583 --> 01:12:33,500
so I was sent there.

473
01:12:38,083 --> 01:12:39,500
I was happy at first…

474
01:12:42,083 --> 01:12:44,791
thinking I'd finally have a home
like normal kids.

475
01:12:51,458 --> 01:12:52,583
That day,

476
01:12:54,458 --> 01:12:55,875
I woke up

477
01:12:57,750 --> 01:12:59,708
and everyone was just like that.

478
01:13:13,083 --> 01:13:13,958
Girls.

479
01:13:21,458 --> 01:13:25,000
{\an8}TRAGIC MASS KILLING

480
01:13:25,083 --> 01:13:29,250
{\an8}THIRTY LIVES LOST IN BRUTAL MASSACRE

481
01:13:29,333 --> 01:13:31,250
{\an8}SURVIVOR OR KILLER?

482
01:13:31,333 --> 01:13:36,083
{\an8}THE SOLE SURVIVOR OF THE MASSACRE
AT A BOARDING SCHOOL IN LOPBURI

483
01:14:13,208 --> 01:14:15,375
I thought I'd get a fresh start here.

484
01:14:19,708 --> 01:14:20,708
But here,

485
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:24,583
there's no difference from before.

486
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,125
Actually…

487
01:14:34,458 --> 01:14:36,708
I learned one thing from everyone here.

488
01:14:40,333 --> 01:14:44,583
The stronger ones always survive.

489
01:14:49,083 --> 01:14:51,458
Retaliate when bullied.

490
01:14:53,833 --> 01:14:58,416
It would be better if this world were free
of those fucking bitches.

491
01:14:58,500 --> 01:14:59,750
Stop it!

492
01:14:59,833 --> 01:15:04,125
Pack your belongings
and get out of here as fast as you can.

493
01:15:04,708 --> 01:15:06,625
Don't ever let me see your face again.

494
01:15:06,708 --> 01:15:08,208
Aren't you happy that

495
01:15:10,083 --> 01:15:11,500
some of your horrible students

496
01:15:12,583 --> 01:15:14,333
who never learned anything from you

497
01:15:15,833 --> 01:15:17,083
finally died?

498
01:15:39,875 --> 01:15:41,708
Pin.

499
01:15:42,333 --> 01:15:44,666
I need to talk to you.
You got to talk to me.

500
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:46,500
Can't you see I'm carrying this thing?

501
01:15:46,583 --> 01:15:48,625
Pin, Ing isn't what you think.

502
01:15:48,708 --> 01:15:49,833
Enough, Aim.

503
01:15:55,083 --> 01:15:56,958
Mother told me to take Ing out of here.

504
01:15:58,458 --> 01:15:59,625
I won't be coming back.

505
01:16:01,708 --> 01:16:02,666
No, Pin.

506
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:04,541
The storm hasn't settled. You can't leave.

507
01:16:04,625 --> 01:16:06,833
You can't go with Ing either.

508
01:16:08,083 --> 01:16:11,250
Pin, all the bad things that have happened

509
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:15,333
and how Maprang died, it's because of
the godmother ghost attached to Ing.

510
01:16:15,416 --> 01:16:17,041
Stop with the nonsense, Aim.

511
01:16:18,875 --> 01:16:20,000
Are you not admitting it

512
01:16:20,083 --> 01:16:23,458
that all of this was because of you?

513
01:16:26,208 --> 01:16:28,333
Pin, please believe me.

514
01:16:29,708 --> 01:16:30,833
Enough, Aim.

515
01:16:32,583 --> 01:16:34,541
Stop doing horrible things like this.

516
01:16:35,875 --> 01:16:37,375
All this time, I was a fool.

517
01:16:38,250 --> 01:16:41,333
I never knew
how horrible you have been to everyone.

518
01:17:04,583 --> 01:17:07,791
THREE YEARS EARLIER

519
01:17:11,875 --> 01:17:13,000
You just got here.

520
01:17:14,375 --> 01:17:16,333
You dare get in trouble?

521
01:17:19,208 --> 01:17:21,000
"Aim-orn Amornroj

522
01:17:21,583 --> 01:17:25,458
sentenced to seven years
in juvenile detention

523
01:17:25,958 --> 01:17:27,875
for attempted murder of a parent--"

524
01:17:27,958 --> 01:17:29,250
He isn't my father.

525
01:17:33,333 --> 01:17:35,583
I just didn't allow anyone to oppress me.

526
01:17:39,875 --> 01:17:42,500
If you don't want to stay for too long,

527
01:17:43,333 --> 01:17:47,208
help me keep everyone here in line

528
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:53,000
and I'll help you gain your freedom.

529
01:18:34,833 --> 01:18:35,750
Nuch.

530
01:18:41,708 --> 01:18:42,708
Ploy.

531
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:51,708
Nuch.

532
01:19:46,333 --> 01:19:47,208
Who's there.

533
01:21:10,583 --> 01:21:11,500
Aim.

534
01:22:32,833 --> 01:22:33,708
Pin.

535
01:22:37,083 --> 01:22:37,958
Pin.

536
01:22:48,708 --> 01:22:50,375
You're fine, aren't you?

537
01:22:52,458 --> 01:22:54,250
We're all fine.

538
01:22:55,208 --> 01:22:56,500
But you…

539
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,208
What's wrong?

540
01:23:00,375 --> 01:23:01,583
The godmother ghost.

541
01:23:02,625 --> 01:23:05,375
She's killing all of us
like at that place.

542
01:23:07,125 --> 01:23:08,750
But we didn't harm Ing.

543
01:23:10,625 --> 01:23:12,708
The only one who did was…

544
01:23:16,958 --> 01:23:20,000
DON'T ENTER WITHOUT PERMISSION
MOTHER'S ROOM

545
01:23:23,583 --> 01:23:28,000
{\an8}SPECIAL ATTENTION NEEDED

546
01:23:28,083 --> 01:23:34,500
MUST REFORM THEIR ATTITUDE OR
THE AUTHORITIES WILL TAKE ACTION.

547
01:24:45,458 --> 01:24:47,958
Aren't you supposed to protect me?

548
01:25:34,583 --> 01:25:38,000
My mother said whoever hurts me,

549
01:25:39,750 --> 01:25:41,208
she will get them.

550
01:26:02,583 --> 01:26:04,583
You shouldn't kill me.

551
01:26:05,625 --> 01:26:07,958
I'm your Mother.

552
01:26:11,958 --> 01:26:13,416
I only have one mother.

553
01:27:13,916 --> 01:27:14,833
Mother.

554
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:19,583
Mother.

555
01:27:26,958 --> 01:27:29,833
You should see these documents.

MISS AIM-ORN AMORNROJ

567
01:28:38,083 --> 01:28:40,958
What does it say?

568
01:28:42,833 --> 01:28:45,458
Many of us have been granted amnesty.

569
01:28:48,833 --> 01:28:53,083
Why didn't Mother let us go?

570
01:28:53,833 --> 01:28:56,833
She's more obsessed with this place
than our lives.

571
01:28:59,583 --> 01:29:00,625
And

572
01:29:01,958 --> 01:29:03,208
what are we going to do?

573
01:29:23,416 --> 01:29:24,625
Testing.

574
01:29:35,208 --> 01:29:36,583
Testing.

575
01:29:44,541 --> 01:29:45,958
<i>Kill them.</i>

576
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:51,541
<i>Kill them.</i>

577
01:29:54,083 --> 01:29:57,375
<i>Let me kill them.</i>

578
01:29:57,458 --> 01:29:59,000
<i>All of them.</i>

579
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:19,416
Ing.

580
01:30:24,375 --> 01:30:26,083
They hurt me again, Pin.

581
01:30:32,333 --> 01:30:33,708
Just break its neck, right?

582
01:30:35,958 --> 01:30:37,375
What if it doesn't work?

583
01:30:59,875 --> 01:31:03,208
Dry yourself and clean up the blood first.

584
01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:45,875
- Aim.
- Pin.

585
01:33:47,750 --> 01:33:49,333
Do you believe me now?

586
01:33:54,416 --> 01:33:55,583
What about Mother?

587
01:33:57,625 --> 01:33:59,666
We're the only ones left on the island.

588
01:34:02,458 --> 01:34:05,666
Where is Ing? Did she come see you?

589
01:34:10,583 --> 01:34:12,166
I locked her up in the lighthouse.

590
01:34:12,250 --> 01:34:13,250
Don't worry.

591
01:34:31,583 --> 01:34:32,708
Where are you going?

592
01:34:33,750 --> 01:34:34,708
Ing.

593
01:34:37,208 --> 01:34:38,083
Pin.

594
01:34:40,166 --> 01:34:41,375
Why did you lock me up?

595
01:34:46,458 --> 01:34:49,208
Are you with this horrible bitch now?

596
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:51,458
Ing.

597
01:34:52,333 --> 01:34:54,291
- Please stop.
- They tried to kill me, Pin.

598
01:34:54,375 --> 01:34:55,500
Did you forget?

599
01:34:55,583 --> 01:34:57,375
You killed Maprang and Mother.

600
01:34:57,458 --> 01:34:58,375
Shut up!

601
01:34:58,458 --> 01:34:59,375
Ing.

602
01:35:02,625 --> 01:35:03,958
Am I that horrible?

603
01:35:05,333 --> 01:35:07,375
When this bitch did horrible things,

604
01:35:07,458 --> 01:35:09,500
nobody gave a shit.

605
01:35:13,958 --> 01:35:15,250
All of you

606
01:35:15,333 --> 01:35:17,958
deserve to die just like those two.

607
01:35:18,958 --> 01:35:19,833
Ing.

608
01:35:23,083 --> 01:35:24,583
What will you get out of this?

609
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:27,958
Don't you want a fresh start?

610
01:37:29,208 --> 01:37:31,375
Aim, just hide in the house.

611
01:37:31,458 --> 01:37:32,416
What about you?

612
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:33,791
Don't worry.

613
01:37:33,875 --> 01:37:35,250
I'll follow soon.

614
01:38:36,375 --> 01:38:37,250
Ploy.

615
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:40,958
Ploy.

616
01:38:47,541 --> 01:38:48,583
Aim.

617
01:38:50,375 --> 01:38:51,541
I'm scared.

618
01:38:55,875 --> 01:38:56,958
What about the others?

619
01:39:46,458 --> 01:39:47,583
Pin.

620
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:49,958
Pin.

621
01:40:07,916 --> 01:40:09,166
Be quiet.

622
01:40:11,708 --> 01:40:12,708
What did you do?

623
01:40:14,916 --> 01:40:16,625
Aim, open the door for me.

624
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:18,958
Aim.

625
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:24,833
You like it, don't you?

626
01:40:25,833 --> 01:40:27,208
Frightening people?

627
01:40:27,833 --> 01:40:30,125
How does it feel
when the tables are turned?

628
01:40:34,458 --> 01:40:35,458
Ing.

629
01:40:38,083 --> 01:40:39,750
Please don't hurt me.

630
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,958
We both were bullied by Aim, weren't we?

631
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:47,708
I've been helping you, remember?

632
01:41:22,875 --> 01:41:23,958
Get off of me!

633
01:41:30,333 --> 01:41:31,958
<i>Let go of my child!</i>

634
01:41:50,833 --> 01:41:51,666
Aim.

635
01:41:54,666 --> 01:41:55,625
Are you okay?

636
01:41:59,875 --> 01:42:00,958
Enough, Ing.

637
01:42:09,750 --> 01:42:10,625
Fine.

638
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:15,458
Let's die together.

639
01:42:17,875 --> 01:42:18,833
Pin.

640
01:42:44,083 --> 01:42:45,750
No one can help you now.

641
01:42:49,583 --> 01:42:50,833
Are you happy

642
01:42:52,583 --> 01:42:54,166
killing everyone like at that place?

643
01:42:55,958 --> 01:42:56,958
Back there,

644
01:42:58,208 --> 01:42:59,458
I didn't mean to.

645
01:43:03,458 --> 01:43:04,583
But here,

646
01:43:05,750 --> 01:43:06,750
with you…

647
01:44:31,875 --> 01:44:33,375
Where are you going?

648
01:44:50,416 --> 01:44:53,250
It won't be over till you're dead.

649
01:45:29,541 --> 01:45:30,750
Let me go!

650
01:45:48,500 --> 01:45:51,166
Go on. Just kill me.

651
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,833
I have nowhere to go anyway.

652
01:45:54,833 --> 01:45:57,166
Dying with you doesn't sound so bad.

653
01:45:58,208 --> 01:45:59,375
Kill me.

654
01:46:01,708 --> 01:46:03,500
You're good at this anyway.

655
01:46:28,625 --> 01:46:29,583
No.

656
01:46:33,125 --> 01:46:34,208
I won't kill you.

657
01:46:36,125 --> 01:46:38,083
I'm about to start my new life

658
01:46:39,708 --> 01:46:40,750
and have a future.

659
01:46:44,083 --> 01:46:45,458
Look at you now.

660
01:46:46,958 --> 01:46:48,458
Even if you make it out alive,

661
01:46:50,208 --> 01:46:51,958
you'll rot in prison anyway.

662
01:46:54,250 --> 01:46:58,250
It's your choice how you want to die.

663
01:47:02,875 --> 01:47:03,875
No.

664
01:47:04,375 --> 01:47:05,833
Come back and kill me.

665
01:47:06,833 --> 01:47:08,583
Come back and kill me!

666
01:47:09,791 --> 01:47:11,458
Come back and kill me!

667
01:47:30,958 --> 01:47:31,958
Do you know

668
01:47:33,208 --> 01:47:34,250
all this time,

669
01:47:35,625 --> 01:47:37,333
how hard I've tried

670
01:47:38,083 --> 01:47:39,833
to stop my mother from killing you all?

671
01:48:44,083 --> 01:48:46,083
You can't escape what you did.

672
01:49:16,833 --> 01:49:21,041
Come back to me, my child.

673
01:49:22,166 --> 01:49:26,791
I won't let you feel the pain again.

674
01:50:38,458 --> 01:50:40,250
<i>Rampa Island.</i>

675
01:50:40,333 --> 01:50:43,458
<i>From the Chonburi Fleet</i>
<i>Operations Center 527, over.</i>

676
01:51:13,958 --> 01:51:15,916
<i>Upon inspecting the school grounds,</i>

677
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,541
<i>we've found the bodies of</i>
<i>an adult woman and two young girls.</i>

678
01:51:20,833 --> 01:51:24,375
<i>The bodies show injuries</i>
<i>caused by sharp objects.</i>

679
01:51:32,458 --> 01:51:34,083
I didn't do it.

680
01:51:35,625 --> 01:51:37,458
It was Ingkhwan and her godmother ghost.

681
01:51:42,958 --> 01:51:44,208
I'm telling the truth.

682
01:51:51,458 --> 01:51:53,291
It wasn't me.

683
01:51:54,833 --> 01:51:57,833
It was Ingkhwan and her godmother ghost.

684
01:52:01,583 --> 01:52:03,583
<i>Taking the first group of girls out now.</i>

685
01:52:12,333 --> 01:52:16,416
Be careful. Go, go. Let's go.

686
01:52:23,083 --> 01:52:24,083
Ploy.

687
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:26,750
They're misunderstanding me.

688
01:52:27,625 --> 01:52:29,708
Can you tell them what really happened?

689
01:52:42,125 --> 01:52:45,083
Can you all tell them what happened?

690
01:52:55,458 --> 01:52:57,333
Tell them now.

691
01:52:57,416 --> 01:52:59,083
I really didn't do it.

692
01:53:00,083 --> 01:53:03,375
Anyone named Ingkhwan here?
Has anyone seen her?

693
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:10,708
Ploy, tell them.

694
01:53:11,125 --> 01:53:13,250
Tell them what happened.

695
01:53:13,333 --> 01:53:15,125
Tell them what Ing did.

696
01:53:28,583 --> 01:53:30,083
I saved your life.

697
01:53:32,500 --> 01:53:33,958
You have to tell them!

698
01:53:41,625 --> 01:53:42,666
Here,

699
01:53:43,500 --> 01:53:45,458
there was no one named Ingkhwan.

700
01:53:47,333 --> 01:53:50,875
The one who did all this is her.

701
01:53:50,958 --> 01:53:52,833
We all can back that up.

702
01:54:06,958 --> 01:54:08,458
I've been waiting for this day.

703
01:54:09,375 --> 01:54:11,166
The day you have to pay.

704
01:54:19,041 --> 01:54:20,291
Just kill her, Ing.

705
01:54:21,375 --> 01:54:23,250
I won't tell anyone about this.

706
01:54:30,083 --> 01:54:31,416
What did you just say?

707
01:54:31,500 --> 01:54:34,041
- Calm down, kid.
- You said I did it?

708
01:54:34,125 --> 01:54:35,500
You said I did it?

709
01:54:35,583 --> 01:54:36,541
Calm down.

710
01:54:36,625 --> 01:54:40,958
I saved your life! And yours!
You should remember that!

711
01:54:41,041 --> 01:54:42,166
That's enough. Let's go.

712
01:54:42,250 --> 01:54:44,458
- Let me go. I didn't do it.
- Let's go.

713
01:54:44,541 --> 01:54:46,333
- I didn't do it.
- Let's go.

714
01:55:09,583 --> 01:55:11,250
<i>Mother always said that</i>

715
01:55:11,333 --> 01:55:13,833
<i>this place provides everyone</i>

716
01:55:13,916 --> 01:55:18,458
<i>a fresh start with hope,</i>

717
01:55:18,541 --> 01:55:21,750
<i>only if you listen and follow the rules.</i>

718
01:55:21,833 --> 01:55:25,000
PINITKHUN, REMEMBER
AND UPHOLD OUR TEACHER'S WORDS

719
01:55:25,083 --> 01:55:27,208
<i>But I don't buy that crap</i>

720
01:55:28,208 --> 01:55:30,000
<i>because every rule in this world</i>
<i>is rigged.</i>

721
01:55:30,083 --> 01:55:32,250
<i>It's there to protect powerful people.</i>

722
01:55:32,833 --> 01:55:37,916
<i>People like us</i>
<i>still have to fight each other</i>

723
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,041
<i>just to barely survive another day.</i>

724
01:55:45,666 --> 01:55:47,500
<i>Right, Ing?</i>

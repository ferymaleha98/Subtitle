3
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:16,125
<i>Okay, so we messed up.</i>

4
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,708
<i>Somebody pushed the button,
and the world nearly ended.</i>

5
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:22,207
<i>We still don't know
exactly who it was,</i>

6
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:23,833
<i>but it doesn't matter.</i>

7
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,124
<i>What matters is
the world didn't end.</i>

8
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:29,457
<i>We rebuilt it
and made it better.</i>

9
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:32,124
<i>Well, better for some.</i>

10
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,999
<i>They are called the Genetics.</i>

11
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,208
<i>Genetically-improved humans
that live like kings.</i>

12
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,999
<i>Then there's the rest of us.</i>

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,415
<i>The Specials.</i>

14
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:44,124
<i>Although there's nothing
special about us.</i>

15
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:47,291
<i>For us, genetic improvements
just don't work.</i>

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,374
<i>We're as normal as humans
have ever been.</i>

17
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:51,790
<i>But in today's world,</i>

18
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:53,832
<i>that makes us
the scum of the Earth,</i>

19
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:55,957
<i>or what's left of it.</i>

20
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:58,166
<i>This is our story.</i>

21
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:07,624
Sixty-five years ago,

22
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:09,082
the great
nuclear war brought

23
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:10,790
the old world to an end.

24
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,374
Structures once thought of

25
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:14,249
- as formidable, the electric...
-  <i>Leon, go. Move on.</i>

26
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,749
...and the international
communication networks

27
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,416
crumbled overnight.

28
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:22,499
Plunged into a world
of technological crisis,

29
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,457
humans finally turned to a power

30
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,707
that had always
been close at hand.

31
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,041
Nature.

32
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:31,125
How many of you know
who this man is?

33
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:33,291
Liam Smith.

34
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:35,624
<i>Correct. Liam Smith.</i>

35
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:38,083
<i>Our greatest botanist
and genetic engineer.</i>

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,915
In the forests of the Amazon,

37
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:44,165
Professor Smith found
the Genesis Tree.

38
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,540
Leon? You ready?

39
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,165
<i>Just give me
a second here.</i>

40
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,915
A marvel of nature
that appeared after the war.

41
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:54,499
As a result of the war,

42
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,082
the old power system
was destroyed.

43
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:59,915
But scientists soon learned
to utilize the Genesis flower

44
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:02,582
<i>to harvest and source
energy to replace</i>

45
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,291
<i>the damaged electric grid.</i>

46
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,165
<i>The Genesis Tree flowers
accumulate</i>

47
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,749
an incredible amount of energy,

48
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,790
and nowadays,

49
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:12,208
the Genesis energy
is everywhere.

50
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,207
- <i>The Genesis Tree is very...</i>
- Chloe. I'm in.

51
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,915
- <i>to the external conditions...</i>
- How's it going out there?

52
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:18,790
<i>Hurry up,
it's damn boring.</i>

53
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,832
<i>...and humidity.</i>

54
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,290
Considering the significance
of these plants,

55
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:26,665
every single Genesis Tree
is controlled by the government.

56
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,707
They're grown and maintained...

57
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,790
You see
the game last night?

58
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:33,625
Yeah, D'Abruzzo's pass
nearly knocked Juniper out.

59
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:37,166
It's really hard to find
a good linebacker these days.

60
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,625
All right, little buddy.

61
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,500
Time to cause some trouble.

62
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:47,040
Seriously,
Juniper couldn't catch a ball

63
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,208
even if a courier
handed it to him.

64
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,083
What the hell?

65
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,957
Come here.

66
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:01,207
They let us
bring toys to work now?

67
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,375
Come on! Stop, you little shit!

68
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,832
Get back here.

69
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:06,916
What is it?

70
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,333
Beats me. We better call it in.

71
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,666
-  <i>It's me!</i>
- Oh.

72
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,125
<i>Good night!</i>

73
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,875
Good work, Mr. Stinky.

74
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:25,416
Okay.

75
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:27,791
Come on.

76
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:30,916
Yes!

77
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:37,582
<i>In the aftermath,
90 percent of children</i>

78
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,207
<i>were born with devastating</i>

79
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,916
- <i>genetic disorders...</i>
- This one.

80
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,957
- <i>But then, hope blossomed.</i>
- Okay.

81
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,249
- <i>Quite literally.</i>
- Okay.

82
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,374
<i>The flower came to our rescue!</i>

83
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,499
Access for one,
access for two...

84
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,541
Yeah.

85
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,040
<i>...and successfully
integrated it</i>

86
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,749
<i>into the human genome.</i>

87
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,915
<i>This groundbreaking
achievement sparked</i>

88
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,082
- <i>a biological revolution.</i>
- Yeah.

89
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:07,082
<i>Humans transcended
their physical limitations,</i>

90
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,457
<i>taking an evolutionary
leap forward.</i>

91
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,750
<i>With careful
genetic engineering...</i>

92
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,958
Come on,
come on, come on.

93
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,790
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

94
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,249
<i>Mankind was
no longer constrained</i>

95
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,915
<i>by its old vulnerabilities.</i>

96
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:31,125
<i>We had entered a new era
of possibility and potential.</i>

97
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,874
For more than half
a century now,

98
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,707
every person is born
with a genetic improvement

99
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,249
that they received
before they were born.

100
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,999
Take a look at each other.

101
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,374
Some of you
have improved hearing,

102
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,040
others can run faster,

103
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,457
some have improved vision

104
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,582
or highly evolved
smell and taste.

105
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:56,957
And some of us may even
sing like an angel,

106
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,665
like Mira,

107
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:01,082
recipient of one
of the Institute's most

108
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:03,290
advanced vocal improvements.

109
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,790
Oh, my God, that's Mira!

110
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,082
For all these improvements,

111
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,416
we have Dr. Liam Smith
to thank.

112
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,790
Shame he didn't find
a cure for the freaks!

113
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,165
Yes.

114
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,082
Bobby! You know
we don't call them freaks.

115
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,749
We call them Specials.

116
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,582
Because not everyone
is as lucky as us.

117
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:24,540
Ten percent of humans suffer
from an immune deficiency

118
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,290
that prohibits
genetic improvement.

119
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,540
<i>It's not their fault,</i>

120
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,874
<i>and they can still live
meaningful lives</i>

121
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:32,249
and be of great use
to society doing

122
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,957
maintenance, cleanup,
and other less demanding tasks.

123
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:38,124
<i>But without someone
taking care of these tasks...</i>

124
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,666
Oh, Chloe.

125
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,499
Chloe.

126
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,000
The code's incorrect.

127
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,082
You... you need to get the code.

128
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,665
<i>Give me
the right code, now.</i>

129
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:48,624
Okay.

130
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,457
For that,
we call them "Specials."

131
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,374
There's nothing
special about them.

132
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:53,749
They're just a bunch of freaks.

133
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,457
Yeah. My dad says we should
put them down like dogs.

134
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,832
- You sick bastard! Shut up!
- Hey! Hey, what are you?

135
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,457
A freak lover?

136
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:02,458
-  Fight! Fight! Fight!
- Help, I'm being bullied! Help!

137
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,082
- Help! Shut up!
- Hey, hey, hey! Stop!

138
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,666
Knock it off, I said,
everybody! Calm down!

139
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:09,415
Mister! Mister, help!

140
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:10,833
- They're being mean!
- Get off!

141
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,124
What the hell is going on here?

142
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,000
Everything's fine.
I'll take care of it.

143
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,249
Okay, Leon.

144
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:23,708
Now, please try
1304-2029. Okay?

145
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:30,790
Rock and roll.

146
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:31,875
We're in.

147
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,665
Now, children,
we still have a class to finish.

148
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,249
I don't want to
contact your parents.

149
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,415
I don't care.

150
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:40,458
Snap it.

151
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:42,875
Follow me to the next exhibit.

152
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,332
<i>The institute
was established</i>

153
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,582
<i>to house the Genesis Tree</i>

154
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,999
<i>at the heart of our city,
harness its power...</i>

155
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,040
Okay. Sleep tight.

156
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:59,540
<i>...to study its remarkable
biological properties.</i>

157
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:02,999
<i>Teams of dedicated scientists
work tirelessly</i>

158
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,457
<i>to unlock the mysteries</i>

159
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,290
- <i>of the Genesis Tree.</i>
-  We're all equal.

160
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:07,500
Sure thing, Mom.

161
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,124
Okay, Chloe.

162
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,000
Three minutes. Get ready.

163
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,833
-  <i>What was that?</i>
-  Nothing. It's nothing.

164
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:06,165
<i>The Genesis Tree
absorbs nuclear material</i>

165
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,040
<i>from the contaminated
atmosphere</i>

166
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,415
<i>and transforms it
into pure energy,</i>

167
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,457
<i>which it stores
in its blossoms,</i>

168
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:13,915
<i>the Genesis flowers.</i>

169
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:17,332
<i>These flowers,
our most valuable resource,</i>

170
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,374
<i>are safeguarded
within Genesis Institutes</i>

171
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,790
<i>across the globe.</i>

172
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:23,957
<i>Each tree functions
as a self-sustaining "reactor,"</i>

173
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,457
<i>providing energy
to power our cities</i>

174
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,332
<i>and fuel our vehicles,</i>

175
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:31,290
<i>ensuring the survival
and advancement of humanity.</i>

176
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,750
Okay. Come to Daddy.

177
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:40,957
<i>A breach has been detected</i>

178
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,540
<i>in the containment chamber.</i>

179

00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,166
<i>please vacate

182
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,749
Okay, that's everything.

183
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,207
Attention, kids!
We must leave the building!

184
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,958
Kids, everybody out!

185
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,457
Hello?
What do we have here?

186
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,040
Everybody out!

187
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,332
-  Please follow me.
- <i>A breach has been detected...</i>

188

- Follow in an orderly manner.
- <i>Facility lockdown imminent.</i>

<i>All nonessential personnel,</i>

190
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,833
<i>please vacate
the premises immediately.</i>

191
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,540
Hey, you better watch
where you're going, huh?

192
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:29,540
I'm sorry.

193
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:30,791
Give it back to me!

194
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,458
What's that sound?

195
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:41,999
Oh. It's...

196
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,208
It's, uh... It's just a watch.

197
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,165
You think we're all
equal here, freak?

198
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,624
No, no, no, no, no,
not at all.

199
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:55,915
It was my mom's.

200
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:59,458
My, uh, parents liquidated
the radiation zone.

201
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:03,540
Mom used to say that, uh,
we all get sick at some point.

202
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:04,540
Rich, poor,

203
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,333
we're all in this together.

204
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:09,665
Get out of here.

00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,499
<i>I'm Senator Frank Kessler,</i>

206
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,040

207

<i>for a Brilliant Genetic Future

00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:25,082
<i>Join me in proclaiming

210
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,957
- Okay.
- ... <i>a groundbreaking stride</i>

211
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,249

00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,207
<i>I'm Mira Jones.</i>

214
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,124
<i>In support of Prop 42,</i>

215
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,540
<i>I'm starting
a Special District tour</i>

216
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,000
<i>from January 7th!</i>

217
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,832
<i>Tickets are free,

218
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:48,875
<i>and let's celebrate
Genetic Unity for all!</i>

219
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:50,875
Oh, my God.

220
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,541
- What took you so long?
- Shut up!

221
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:01,207
Just because I'm on wheels
doesn't mean I'm a racing car.

222
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,250
Whatever, old man.

223
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,790
Did you see that?

224
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:05,916
See what?

225
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,707
She's coming to our district.
We have to go!

226
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,665
Oh, oh.

227
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:14,875
It's a hard no.

228
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,916
Come on, now!
Don't be such a relic.

229
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:22,957
What's going on?

230
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:25,915
- No more school.
-  I mean,

231
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:29,125
since when have we ever had
a concert in our district, huh?

232
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,624
She's just another
elitist Genetic

233
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,874
pretending to care
about us Specials, Chloe.

234
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,750
At least she's trying to help.

235
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:37,957
All you do
is bitch, bitch, bitch.

236
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,290
Can't you see?

237
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,874
If Prop 42 passes,

238
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,750
it's gonna make our lives
so much better.

239
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,457
Don't believe everything
you see on the TV.

240
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:49,540
Especially if it's coming from
a slick politician like Kessler.

241
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,124
You're so cynical,
you know that?

242
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,124
Yeah, well, you're so naive!

243
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,458
Oh, I'm naive?

244
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,041
Yeah?

245
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,832
- Oh, Chloe!
- Oh!

246
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,958
Oh, Chloe. Just stop it!

247
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:03,458
Get out of here, you freak!

248
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,457
You see? Off limits.

249
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,040
Bunch of jerks.

250
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,833
Mom, who drew that picture?

251
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,332
The bad guys did.

252
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,666
But why?

253
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:20,832
Because
they want to hurt us.

254
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,415
But you don't have
to worry about them.

255
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,791
Me and your dad
will keep you safe.

256
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,500
-  Carol?
- Mira.

257
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,165
The Special District is unsafe.

258
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,415
The concert is a big enough
risk as is.

259
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:15,124
I simply can't allow you
to do an autograph session.

260
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,415
The whole point
of the Echoes Tour

261
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:18,832
is to include the Specials

262
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,707
and meet them
in their own backyard.

263
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:23,416
Prop 42 is about
uniting people, right?

264
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,999
"Genetic unity for all."
Isn't that what we're selling?

265
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,749
And how am I supposed to do that

266
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,332
behind a huge security detail
and bulletproof windows?

267
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,540
It makes no sense.

268
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:33,790
Stop being so dramatic!

269
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,332
I'm not being dramatic!

270
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,499
They still love you
even if they can't touch you.

271
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,790
I'm just being cautious.

272
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:41,208
I'm done arguing about this.

273
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,290
Pick up the phone and uncancel
what you've just canceled

274
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,166
because I'm going to meet
the Specials.

275
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,625
Halt. Identifications.

276
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,999
It's my niece's birthday.

277
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,125
We went to Greenwood
to buy her a present.

278
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:33,875
-  Thank you.
-  Thank you.

279
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:35,582
Come on, Chloe.

280
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:36,791
Let's go home.

281
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,707
And these freaks
complain about being poor.

282
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:43,208
Bunch of scam artists,
if you ask me.

283
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,374
Step right up,
step right up.

284
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,415
Hey, buddy.

285
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:47,957
- What's up, T?
-  Hey. What's up?

286
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,249
Is that the, uh... THX 1138?

287
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,874
-  Eh, yo, this one?
- Yeah.

288
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:55,499
<i>Senator Kessler,

289
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,874
<i>When it passes.</i>

290
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:59,707
<i>Yes, well...
many are wondering,</i>

291
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,332
<i>how will you be able
to hold on to your promises?</i>

292
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,832
<i>Uniting the Genetics
and Specials...</i>

293
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:07,166
<i>the idea is not
without its detractors.</i>

294
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,332
The answer lies
in science, Laura.

295
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:11,374
For many years now,

296
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:12,874
I've been leading
a research team

297
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,457
in the development of a drug

298
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,415
that enables
genetic enhancements

299
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,583
to take place
not only before birth,

300
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:20,749
but also during adulthood.

301
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,750
For everyone,
including Specials.

302
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:24,999
<i>That's why I'm campaigning</i>

303
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,500

00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,207

What do you think?

315
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:47,915
Will he succeed?

316
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,624
I think we've got
a lot of work to do.

317
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:50,500
Come on.

318
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:52,708
Okay.

Scram! What have I told you

00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:58,832
Hey, screw you, buddy!

322
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,415
Hey, calm down!
They're just kids.

323
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:02,749
All right.

324
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,957
They're not doing
anything that serious.

325
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:08,832
All right, all right.

326
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,749
Home, sweet home.

327
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,999
Come in there.

328
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,041
I'm gonna check
on my plants.

329
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,875
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

330
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,583
Here you go.

331
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,208
Hope it was worth
almost getting caught.

332
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,083
Of course, it was.

333
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,083
Kidding me?

334
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,625
Now we can make
some serious cash.

335
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,166
Wait.

336
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,500
You used all of my acid fruits,
didn't you?

337
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,082
Do you have any idea
how hard it is to grow them?

338
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,415
Screw your fruits.

339
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,291
Check it out.

340
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,915
- This is...
- Genesis flower extract.

341
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,957
Use it wisely, "Doctor."

342
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,333
This is hard to find.

343
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,790
This is... awesome!

344
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:31,999
Now I can experiment on--

345
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,457
Why don't you start
by experimenting

346
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:34,707
on those dishes? Huh?

347
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,332
They're growing
their own ecosystem.

348
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,165
Why is it always my job?

349
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,040
Because when your parents
were taken,

350
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,290
I promised them
that you could make it

351
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:46,166
in this big, scary world,
all on your own.

352
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,665
Yep.

353
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:48,790
That's why I have
to do the dishes.

354
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,165
That's why you have to go
do the dishes.

355
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,333
- Great. Thank you. Thank you.
- Go on, scram!

356

366
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,875
All right, young lady,
time to earn your keep!

367
00:19:58,625 --> 00:19:59,750
Let's make some money!

368
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:06,666
You again.

369
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,083
Let's see what's up this time.

370
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,499
I'm gonna start my new
greenhouse project tomorrow.

371
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,874
Mm.

372
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:18,790
Well, if I find any
prickly bindweed on my wires,

373
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,207
your green friends
will be out on the street.

374
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,624
Just try it.

375
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:25,124
Need I remind you, this basement
belonged to my parents?

376
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,083
You are just a tenant.

377
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,915
Without me,
your business is done.

378
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:34,749
Ah.

379
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,791
That's not gonna be
enough, buddy.

380
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,541
Thanks.

381
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,375
Next!

382
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,083
-  <i>New device detected.</i>
- There.

383
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,124
Pretty nifty, huh?

384
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,708
And it records video too.

385
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:54,625
Next one!

386
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:04,666
All right.

387
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:29,207
- Leon's Wares, yes?
-  <i>Guys, it's an emergency.</i>

388
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,499
- <i>You need to come here now!</i>
- No, we're done for today.

389
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,874
You gotta call us
again tomorrow.

390
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,415
<i>No, no, no. Hold on.
Don't hang up.</i>

391
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:35,999
<i>You need to come
and fix this suit now!</i>

392
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,083
No, we don't do on-site repairs.
You'll have to come to us.

393
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,832
<i>I've got the money.
Just come over!</i>

394
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,124
It doesn't matter
how much you pay.

395
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,249
<i>I'm in
the Genetic District.</i>

396
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,000
Especially not
in the Genetic District.

397
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:47,790
Hello.

398
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,457
- How can I help you, sir?
- <i>Hey, you gotta solve this.</i>

399
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:50,749
- <i>Get your ass here now...</i>
- Money matters.

400
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,249
<i>...and fix my suit.
I'll pay you triple.</i>

401
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,582
Triple fee? Deal.

402
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:54,999
<i>I'm at the Saint
Devonshire restaurant.</i>

403
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,040
<i>At the Genetic District...</i>

404
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,624
Yeah, yeah,
I know where that is.

405
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,290
-  <i>Please make it quick.</i>
- Uh... Yep. We're on the way.

406
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,707
We're on the way.

407
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:01,874
Are you nuts?

408
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,457
Triple fee!

409
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:04,915
Money is survival, Chloe.

410
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:06,582
You'll learn that eventually.

411
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:09,665
Just in case you forgot,
what we do is illegal.

412
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:11,208
So, we have rules, Leon!

413
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:14,082
We don't go to the customers.
The customers come to us.

414
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,749
It'll be in, out, boom!

415
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,624
Triple fee.
Look, we need the money.

416
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:20,415
How are we gonna get there
without being captured?

417
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,625
You'll end up in jail,
and I'll go to an orphanage.

418
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:24,957
Is it worth an
extra couple of hundred?

419
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:26,999
I know a shortcut
around the checkpoint.

420
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,665
Everything will be fine!

421
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:29,750
Just trust me.

422
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:34,124
<i>The main thing is not
to get caught by the patrol.</i>

423
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:37,290
<i>First, you go through
the old fence at 62nd Street,</i>

424
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:39,415
<i>then cross the border wall
through an opening</i>

425
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:40,874
<i>on Classon Avenue.</i>

426
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:43,665
<i>And finally, you take
the old underground tunnel</i>

427
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:44,582
<i>at Brighton.</i>

428
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:45,624
<i>And voila!</i>

429
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:47,332
<i>You're safely
on the other side.</i>

430
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,207
<i>I hate you, Leon.</i>

431
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:11,915
One of the things
I love about this wine

432
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:14,665
is that its bouquet
is so fragrant.

433
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:17,415
You can smell the roses
and cherries.

434
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:19,166
And it's delicate.

435
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:21,708
Isn't it lovely?

436
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,332
That's right.

437
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:28,833
Uh, wonderful.

438
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:36,540
Um-um. No.

439
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:38,083
No, that's not well done.

440
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:43,790
Right.

441
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:45,708
She was going to show me
that data, you know?

442
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:48,208
Ready to order?

443
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:51,166
Yeah, the customer
looked great.

444
00:23:58,625 --> 00:23:59,874
Go!

445
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:01,333
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

446
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:06,207
-  Hey! Over here!
-  Is it just you?

447
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:08,416
Yes. Hurry up.

448
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:20,749
All right. Keep those
pesky Specials out, huh?

449
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,540
Very funny.

450
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:24,374
Look at this suit!

451
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:25,624
Where the hell
have you been?

452
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:26,666
I almost got busted.

453
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:28,708
Gah...

454
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:31,083
Look at what you've done
to my suit!

455
00:24:32,791 --> 00:24:35,250
I can see the problem
right here.

456
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:38,666
Hurry up.

457
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,500
Oh, my God!
It's the Anti-Genetics.

458
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,458
The... the Anti-Genetics!

459
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:09,375
There. Yes...

460
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:12,708
There she is.

461
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:15,915
Hold still.

462
00:25:15,916 --> 00:25:19,291
Testing one, two, three!

463
00:25:23,375 --> 00:25:24,499
Thank you.

464
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,915
Thank me?

465
00:25:25,916 --> 00:25:28,374
Thank me once, thank me twice,
thank me three times.

466
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:29,291
Remember the deal?

467
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:32,249
Oh.

468
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,666
Smells great.

469
00:25:37,291 --> 00:25:39,749
Hope you all enjoyed
your meals.

470
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,415
'Cause they're your last.

471
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,458
What?

472
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,874
- What is going on?
-  What?

473
00:25:50,875 --> 00:25:52,082
- Stay here.
-  What?

474
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:53,457
- I'll go have a look.
-  What?

475
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:55,165
Give me the cash!
Give me the money!

476
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:57,875
- What?
-  Just stay calm.

477
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:00,790
Let's deal
with the money first.

478
00:26:00,791 --> 00:26:03,082
Let's get out of here.
Please, now!

479
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:04,207
It was triple-price, Chloe.

480
00:26:04,208 --> 00:26:07,000
Leon, let's get
out of here, now!

481
00:26:37,666 --> 00:26:39,332
It's the Anti-Genetics.

482
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:41,333
They're killing everyone...

483
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,166
We gotta get
out of here, Chloe.

484
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:48,124
What's going on, Leon?
What are we gonna do?

485
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:50,833
Chloe?
Chloe, come and help!

486
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,791
Pull this as hard as you can.

487
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:04,957
Leon, we wouldn't
get far anyway,

488
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:06,583
not with you in that wheelchair.

489
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:11,250
Wait.

490
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:14,415
Chloe, Chloe,
I need your help right now.

491
00:27:14,416 --> 00:27:16,041
Help me put this thing on.

492
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:26,083
-  What do you think?
- It's a frigging masterpiece.

493
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:43,333
Shh!

494
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,875
Seems like
that's the last of 'em.

495
00:27:51,583 --> 00:27:53,708
Man, I was just getting started.

496
00:27:54,458 --> 00:27:55,665
Consider this a rehearsal.

497
00:27:55,666 --> 00:27:57,124
So save your energy.

498
00:27:57,125 --> 00:28:00,249
Tomorrow, the gig,
and the day after that,

499
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,375
the big thing.

500
00:28:01,958 --> 00:28:04,707
Oh, I'm full of energy.
I can keep on hacking these--

501
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:06,749
Tomorrow, we do
everything like I said.

502
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,707
No diverting from the plan.

503
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:10,749
- That clear?
-  Yes, boss.

504
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,082
I can't hear you.

505
00:28:12,083 --> 00:28:13,249
Yes, boss!

506
00:28:16,208 --> 00:28:17,707
Here. Tag this wall.

507
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:18,875
Okay, boss.

508
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:29,999
Cops are on the way.

509
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,875
Let's go.

510
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:32,624
Let's get out of here.

511
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:35,082
Oh, no!

512
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:36,207
Shit!

513
00:28:37,666 --> 00:28:38,874
No survivors.

514
00:28:38,875 --> 00:28:40,416
I told you. Get him!

515
00:28:55,791 --> 00:28:57,250
Ah, it burns!

516
00:29:01,958 --> 00:29:03,790
Come on!
Chloe, come on! Run!

517
00:29:03,791 --> 00:29:06,332
Leave them!
We have to go. Now!

518
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:07,415
Go, go, go!

519
00:29:07,416 --> 00:29:08,875
Go, go, go!

520
00:29:38,333 --> 00:29:39,415
Hey, hey.

521
00:29:39,416 --> 00:29:40,707
Are you all right? Can you...

522
00:29:40,708 --> 00:29:42,458
Can you walk
in that thing at all?

523
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:45,499
-  Come on.
-  Okay...

524
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,708
-  Come on, come on.
-  Okay.

525
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:49,249
- Be careful!
- I got it.

526
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,332
{\an8}<i>Today's attack

00:30:06,166 --> 00:30:08,457
<i>possibly wearing
some kind of mechanical armor,</i>

535
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:09,832
<i>and a girl.</i>

536
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:11,415
<i>If you encounter
these individuals,</i>

537
00:30:11,416 --> 00:30:13,290
<i>you are advised
to immediately call the police,</i>

538
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:15,540
<i>as they are armed
and extremely dangerous.</i>

539
00:30:15,541 --> 00:30:17,249
Dangerous?
We didn't do anything!

540
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,374
Just hold on. I'm thinking.

541
00:30:18,375 --> 00:30:20,457
They're lying.
We didn't do any of it!

542
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:22,166
Go tell that to the police.
Be my guest.

543
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:25,083
<i>Captain Hughes!</i>

544
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,875
<i>Captain Hughes!</i>

545
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:30,374
{\an8}<i>Would you care to comment
on the upcoming raid</i>

546
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:31,582
{\an8}<i>in the Special District?</i>

547
00:30:31,583 --> 00:30:33,457
{\an8}<i>Special District is an ulcer</i>

548
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:34,707
<i>on the body of the city.</i>

549
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:35,832
- Look.
- <i>It's time to clean up...</i>

550
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:36,957
What do you think I'm doing?

551
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:38,124
Wait, no.

552
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:39,665
It's the maniac
with the machete!

553
00:30:39,666 --> 00:30:42,457
{\an8}<i>It breeds freak gangs
like this one.</i>

554
00:30:42,458 --> 00:30:43,541
Hughes?

555
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:46,332
Isn't he, like, the head
of the Special Forces?

556
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:47,374
That scar!

557
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:48,500
You saw it, Chloe.

558
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:52,457
<i>Freaks!</i>

559
00:30:52,458 --> 00:30:54,874
{\an8}<i>Remember, we are
coming for you!</i>

560
00:30:54,875 --> 00:30:56,290
It is him.

561
00:30:58,416 --> 00:31:00,250
Well, that explains
why they've never been caught.

562
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,749
Why would the Genetics
attack their own kind?

563
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,999
It doesn't make any sense.

564
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,208
I have no idea.

565
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,166
What? What is it?

566
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:19,499
One of them dropped it.

567
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,832
Mira?

568
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:22,790
I can't see these guys
being a fan of her.

569
00:31:22,791 --> 00:31:24,625
I heard them say
they're planning more attacks.

570
00:31:25,708 --> 00:31:26,833
There's some sort
of a diagram here.

571
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:28,875
Wait.

572
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:30,750
The concert is tomorrow.

573
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:33,125
The concert
I was supposed to be going to.

574
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:35,500
Mira is their next target.

575
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:38,458
Of course.

576
00:31:39,166 --> 00:31:41,041
A star that big
in the Special District?

577
00:31:41,916 --> 00:31:43,832
If the AGS wanna frame
the Specials,

578
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:45,291
then they're not gonna miss
a chance like this.

579
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:48,041
But what are they trying
to achieve?

580
00:31:48,708 --> 00:31:49,832
I don't know.

581
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:51,749
This man wants
to paint the Specials

582
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,625
to be criminals and murderers.

583
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:56,790
Probably to push us back
even further on the pretext

584
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:58,666
of fighting crime.
This guy is a psycho!

585
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,291
Well, we gotta
do something, then.

586
00:32:03,416 --> 00:32:04,375
Yeah, we do.

587
00:32:06,416 --> 00:32:07,458
Leave town?

588
00:32:08,041 --> 00:32:10,374
But what about Mira and all
of the people at the concert?

589
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:11,915
- We have to save them.
- Crazy?

590
00:32:11,916 --> 00:32:13,457
Save them? How?

591
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:16,582
You're a 12-year-old girl,
and I'm a paraplegic.

592
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:17,874
It's not like we can go
to the cops.

593
00:32:17,875 --> 00:32:18,791
We're wanted for murder!

594
00:32:19,458 --> 00:32:20,582
But if this happens,

595
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:22,708
all Specials will be
considered criminals!

596
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:26,915
Don't you understand?
It's not just about us anymore!

597
00:32:26,916 --> 00:32:29,165
It'll be bad for everyone.
Why don't you care?

598
00:32:29,166 --> 00:32:31,999
I care about us
and saving our asses.

599
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,165
How?

600
00:32:33,166 --> 00:32:35,207
If we run,
we'll lose my parents' workshop,

601
00:32:35,208 --> 00:32:36,832
and then we'll be out
on the street.

602
00:32:36,833 --> 00:32:39,082
They're looking for us
all over the country!

603
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:41,499
It's not like we have
a choice here, Chloe.

604
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,208
We have to at least warn people
and warn Mira.

605
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:46,874
Then we'll definitely get caught
and thrown in jail

606
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:48,540
for the rest of our lives.

607
00:32:48,541 --> 00:32:51,166
So stop talking nonsense
and get packing!

608
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,625
I'm not going with you.

609
00:33:01,208 --> 00:33:02,375
Chloe, stop.

610
00:33:03,916 --> 00:33:07,791
Mira and the people
didn't take care of you.

611
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:09,791
I did.

612
00:33:11,083 --> 00:33:12,665
If it wasn't for me, you know,
they would've put you

613
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:14,165
in a home years ago.

614
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:15,332
You're my responsibility.

615
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:17,000
And you will do what I tell you!

616
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,125
So, get packing.

617
00:33:24,041 --> 00:33:24,833
Screw you.

618
00:33:27,708 --> 00:33:28,915
Excuse me?

619
00:33:28,916 --> 00:33:29,916
Screw you.

620
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:34,166
I've always thought of you
as my older brother.

621
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:37,874
As the only decent person
in this crappy town!

622
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:39,749
But you're just out
for yourself,

623
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,082
and screw everybody else!

624
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:42,082
You're nothing

625
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:44,125
but a piece of shit on wheels!

626
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:00,375
Chloe!

627
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:03,666
Chlo...

628
00:34:22,916 --> 00:34:24,875
<i>It's not just
about us anymore!</i>

629
00:34:25,791 --> 00:34:27,457
<i>It'll be bad for everyone.</i>

630
00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:28,832
<i>Why don't you care?</i>

631
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:30,208
"Equal," my ass.

632
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:34,415
<i>I've always thought
of you as my older brother.</i>

633
00:34:34,416 --> 00:34:36,250
Just "a piece of shit
on wheels."

634
00:35:15,541 --> 00:35:16,832
<i>You're a 12-year-old girl,</i>

635
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:18,249
<i>and I'm a paraplegic.</i>

636
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:20,541
<i>All you do
is bitch, bitch, bitch.</i>

637
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:26,250
Maybe I can level
the playing field.

638
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,416
What the...

639
00:35:52,791 --> 00:35:53,791
Leon?

640
00:35:55,833 --> 00:35:56,833
What is this?

641
00:35:57,916 --> 00:35:59,583
Oh, Chloe, good timing.

642
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:01,458
Can you give me a hand?

643
00:36:02,541 --> 00:36:03,915
What are you doing?

644
00:36:03,916 --> 00:36:07,374
Well, giving it a new paint job,
tweaked a few things,

645
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:09,665
and... I think I got an idea.

646
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:12,208
I thought you were
leaving the town.

647
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:15,249
Yeah, well, I changed my mind.

648
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,165
You gonna help me
get in this thing or what?

649
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:36,750
Mm.

650
00:36:37,416 --> 00:36:38,790
Careful, careful.

651
00:36:38,791 --> 00:36:40,040
- Slow down. Okay?
- Yeah.

652
00:36:40,041 --> 00:36:41,124
- Slow down.
- Yeah, I got it.

653
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:42,999
- Slow. You got this?
- Yeah.

654
00:36:45,541 --> 00:36:47,250
I'm gonna take Hughes down,

655
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,540
make him confess,
and throw him to the police.

656
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,000
Hell, yeah!

657
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:54,665
What you gonna fight him with?

658
00:36:54,666 --> 00:36:55,582
Uh...

659
00:36:55,583 --> 00:36:56,582
Give me that.

660
00:36:56,583 --> 00:36:57,957
Oh, yeah. Sure.

661
00:36:57,958 --> 00:36:59,790
- Here.
- All right, stand back.

662
00:36:59,791 --> 00:37:01,458
- Yes.
- Sure.

663
00:37:02,416 --> 00:37:05,290
Oh, careful, careful!
Are you all right?

664
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:07,582
You really gotta be
careful with that, okay?

665
00:37:07,583 --> 00:37:09,082
Not that, not that.
Give me that.

666
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:10,125
Just slow down.

667
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:14,915
No.

668
00:37:14,916 --> 00:37:16,207
Wait.

669
00:37:16,208 --> 00:37:18,582
Wait... wait. Wait!

670
00:37:18,583 --> 00:37:20,165
You've got these bio-wires.

671
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:22,665
I can make reagents
that'll allow you to...

672
00:37:22,666 --> 00:37:24,708
- Arm the suit.
- Exactly.

673
00:37:25,458 --> 00:37:26,500
That's genius.

674
00:37:27,666 --> 00:37:30,124
You'll be able
to release pollen!

675
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:31,207
Shoot thorns!

676
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:32,207
Grow roots!

677
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,540
Roots? Roots? Why roots?

678
00:37:34,541 --> 00:37:36,499
Well, I don't know.

679
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,082

Get down from the fence!
Step down, right now!

692
00:38:33,416 --> 00:38:34,875
Move back, everyone, move back!

693
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,500
Move back!

694
00:38:40,875 --> 00:38:42,875
So what's our plan?

695
00:38:44,125 --> 00:38:46,833
Well, we know Mira
is the target.

696
00:38:47,583 --> 00:38:48,915
So, we guard her

697
00:38:48,916 --> 00:38:50,707
and wait for the AGS to attack.

698
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:52,374
I'll stop them and hold them.

699
00:38:52,375 --> 00:38:53,540
You call the police.

700
00:38:53,541 --> 00:38:55,166
But what if something
happens to you?

701
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,541
We need to make sure
that doesn't happen.

702
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,125
I'm gonna need
a lot of ammunition.

703
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:03,791
Got it.

704
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:13,665
Stop, stop! Help!

705
00:39:13,666 --> 00:39:16,165
No! No! Leave me alone!

706
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:18,165
Get away! Help!

707
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:19,749
Let me go!

708
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:22,415
No! Carol!

709
00:39:23,666 --> 00:39:24,541
Carol!

710
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,790
If you ever wanna
sing again, princess,

711
00:39:29,791 --> 00:39:32,415
I suggest you behave.

712
00:39:32,416 --> 00:39:33,833
Let her go!

713
00:39:41,416 --> 00:39:43,999
What the hell are you?

714
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Who is this clown?

715
00:39:46,708 --> 00:39:48,625
So what's the deal, Flower Man?

716
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,708
Mira, get in the car!

717
00:39:53,083 --> 00:39:54,833
Mira! Mira, over here!

718
00:40:08,916 --> 00:40:10,333
Don't let them get away!

719
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:38,957
Shh!

720
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:40,250
You were the target!

721
00:40:42,916 --> 00:40:43,832
-  Get in the truck!
-  Yes, sir.

722
00:40:43,833 --> 00:40:45,625
Come on.
Get in the car!

723
00:40:47,541 --> 00:40:48,708
Who were those guys?

724
00:40:49,416 --> 00:40:51,332
That's
the Anti-Genetic Squad.

725
00:40:51,333 --> 00:40:52,707
They're trying to kidnap you.

726
00:40:52,708 --> 00:40:53,790
But don't worry,

727
00:40:53,791 --> 00:40:55,291
we're gonna take you
somewhere safe.

728
00:41:29,541 --> 00:41:31,207
Is... is this some kind
of a kidnapping?

729
00:41:31,208 --> 00:41:33,415
- What's going on?
- It's quite the opposite.

730
00:41:33,416 --> 00:41:34,415
- You're...
- What?

731
00:41:34,416 --> 00:41:35,500
You're safe here, I promise you.

732
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:38,165
I'm Chloe. He's Leon.

733
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:40,374
<i>...and occupy
the lowest tier of society.</i>

734
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:42,207
Everything's all right.
You're safe here.

735
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,415
Gosh, Mira, you're...

736
00:41:44,416 --> 00:41:46,040
you're really here, this is...

737
00:41:46,041 --> 00:41:48,540
Okay, can someone just tell me
what's going on?

738
00:41:48,541 --> 00:41:50,665
- I'm like, I'm really confused.
- Wait! I'll be right back.

739
00:41:50,666 --> 00:41:52,040
- Where am I?
- Just a second. Just a second.

740
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:53,374
I'll be right back.
Just wait a second!

741
00:41:54,625 --> 00:41:56,207
It's... it's quite...

742
00:41:56,208 --> 00:41:57,915
<i>...launched a brazen attack...</i>

743
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,457
I know this isn't
the right time and place, but--

744
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:01,957
Chloe!

745
00:42:01,958 --> 00:42:03,999
- Go to your room. Now!
- <i>In a shocking turn of events,</i>

746
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,290
<i>- the criminals attempted...</i>
- Shut up.

747
00:42:05,291 --> 00:42:06,957
<i>...to abduct the singer.</i>

748
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:10,332
<i>Fortunately, Mira managed
to evade capture and escape</i>

749
00:42:10,333 --> 00:42:12,749
<i>with the help
of an unknown entity,</i>

750
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:15,082
<i>and her current whereabouts
remain unknown.</i>

751
00:42:15,083 --> 00:42:17,082
- Wait, you... So...
<i>- During the incident,</i>

752
00:42:17,083 --> 00:42:18,790
<i>Mira's manager
sustained injuries</i>

753
00:42:18,791 --> 00:42:20,375
<i>- and is currently...</i>
- You saved me?

754
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:23,540
Just... it's nothing.

755
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,915
<i>Special forces
led by Captain Hughes...</i>

756
00:42:25,916 --> 00:42:27,250
Are you wounded?

757
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:29,416
I'm fine.

758
00:42:30,875 --> 00:42:32,500
Let me have a look.

759
00:42:33,375 --> 00:42:35,250
Now, let me see. Let me see.

760
00:42:36,166 --> 00:42:38,208
<i>...the search
for Mira continues.</i>

761
00:42:38,791 --> 00:42:40,582
Okay, we're gonna need that--
we need to get that patched up.

762
00:42:42,125 --> 00:42:43,499
<i>...miraculously
managed to escape</i>

763
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,457
<i>the clutches of assailants.</i>

764
00:42:45,458 --> 00:42:47,540
<i>As of now, her current
whereabouts remain unknown...</i>

765
00:42:47,541 --> 00:42:49,707
Okay. It'll burn.

766
00:42:50,916 --> 00:42:52,790
<i>I want to assure everyone</i>

767
00:42:52,791 --> 00:42:54,791
<i>that discrimination
will not be...</i>

768
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:00,707
You seem pretty good at this
for a singer.

769
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:01,750
Yeah...

770
00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:04,708
Actually, I've always wanted
to be a doctor.

771
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,124
- Really?
- Yeah.

772
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:09,290
Help others.

773
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:15,041
Can you just help me
a little more gently, please?

774
00:43:15,958 --> 00:43:16,958
Sorry.

775
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,249
Okay, this should hold,
but no sudden movements,

776
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:26,249
or you're gonna need
much more than that, okay?

777
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:27,208
Thanks.

778
00:43:34,083 --> 00:43:35,208
Aw.

779
00:43:36,416 --> 00:43:38,333
Flower power, huh?

780
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:41,249
- You?
- Yeah. Very cute.

781
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:43,583
I suggest we focus
on something more important.

782
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,624
- Really nice.
- Thank you.

783
00:43:51,416 --> 00:43:53,249
The police
are looking for us.

784
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:54,540
And the Anti-Genetics
are planning

785
00:43:54,541 --> 00:43:55,749
for their next attack.

786
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:56,832
But why?

787
00:43:56,833 --> 00:43:58,124
All they're doing
is making everyone

788
00:43:58,125 --> 00:43:59,415
hate Specials even more.

789
00:43:59,416 --> 00:44:00,999
Well, that's the point.

790
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,165
The AGS are a gang of Genetics.

791
00:44:03,166 --> 00:44:04,875
They're trying
to frame the Specials.

792
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,832
- Hughes is their leader.
-  Wait.

793
00:44:06,833 --> 00:44:09,082
Hughes, as in
Special Forces Hughes?

794
00:44:09,083 --> 00:44:10,624
- Yeah.
- No. That's ridiculous.

795
00:44:10,625 --> 00:44:13,125
Well, they obviously
wanna stop Prop 42.

796
00:44:13,916 --> 00:44:16,290
The main question now is,

797
00:44:16,291 --> 00:44:17,249
where's the next
attack gonna be?

798
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:18,582
No, no. No, no, no.

799
00:44:18,583 --> 00:44:21,458
The main question now is,
how do I get back home?

800
00:44:22,041 --> 00:44:24,999
I've got a big event tomorrow
at the Family Planning Center.

801
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,499
Kessler's expecting me,
all the media is gonna be there.

802
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,457
I need to be there.

803
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:29,666
Wait, that's it.

804
00:44:30,458 --> 00:44:31,332
That's where the next attack
is gonna be.

805
00:44:31,333 --> 00:44:32,624
Wait, what?

806
00:44:32,625 --> 00:44:34,624
The Family Planning Center
is the next target?

807
00:44:34,625 --> 00:44:35,957
Yes, that makes perfect sense!

808
00:44:35,958 --> 00:44:37,582
They were talking about it
at the restaurant.

809
00:44:37,583 --> 00:44:39,457
- Exactly.
- What are you going on about?

810
00:44:39,458 --> 00:44:41,874
- It doesn't make any sense!
- Don't worry about it. Trust me.

811
00:44:41,875 --> 00:44:43,499
It all makes perfect sense.

812
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,249
Today, they tried to get you.

813
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:46,707
Tomorrow, Kessler.

814
00:44:46,708 --> 00:44:48,207
- Kessler?
- Yeah.

815
00:44:48,208 --> 00:44:49,958
Do you remember what they did
to his poster at the club?

816
00:44:53,708 --> 00:44:54,750
Remember?

817
00:44:57,208 --> 00:44:58,458
- Oh, my God.
-  Yeah.

818
00:44:59,208 --> 00:45:00,415
Oh, my God. Maybe...

819
00:45:00,416 --> 00:45:02,415
Maybe he is the next target.

820
00:45:02,416 --> 00:45:04,082
Okay. We have to warn the cops.

821
00:45:04,083 --> 00:45:05,957
No, no, no,
you're not calling anyone.

822
00:45:05,958 --> 00:45:07,832
Hughes himself
works for the police.

823
00:45:07,833 --> 00:45:09,958
We do not know
who else is involved.

824
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,540
If we're gonna stop him,

825
00:45:13,541 --> 00:45:15,332
it has to be a surprise.

826
00:45:15,333 --> 00:45:18,875
I'm, like, your biggest fan,
but he is totally right.

827
00:45:21,666 --> 00:45:24,082
Okay. This is absolutely crazy.

828
00:45:24,083 --> 00:45:25,290
- I'm getting out of here!
- No, you're not going anywhere.

829
00:45:25,291 --> 00:45:26,707
- Hey, let me out!
- No!

830
00:45:26,708 --> 00:45:28,665
- Okay, so you did kidnap me!
- No!

831
00:45:28,666 --> 00:45:30,416
- No?
- Not originally.

832
00:45:31,833 --> 00:45:32,957
- Plans change.
-  Guys.

833
00:45:32,958 --> 00:45:35,874
- Guys, please...
-  This is outrageous.

834
00:45:35,875 --> 00:45:37,375
It's outrageous!

835
00:45:38,041 --> 00:45:41,207
Didn't she say she wanted
to be close to the Specials?

836
00:45:41,208 --> 00:45:43,708
Well, look, here you are.
Enjoy it.

837
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:47,582
I'm gonna make some changes
to the suit.

838
00:45:47,583 --> 00:45:51,124
You're in on this too now,
so just sit tight.

839
00:45:51,125 --> 00:45:52,332
Chloe, look after her.

840
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:54,457

Yeah, I'm gonna help you?

00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:44,166

865
00:46:45,208 --> 00:46:47,124

Mira? Is that you?

869
00:46:58,833 --> 00:47:01,457
Yes, hi. Um...

870
00:47:01,458 --> 00:47:03,290
Miss, you're quite early.

871
00:47:03,291 --> 00:47:04,665
- The event isn't about to--
- Yes.

872
00:47:04,666 --> 00:47:08,249
I've got an appointment
with the head doctor.

873
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:09,665
- Mm-hm.
- Okay, sure.

874
00:47:09,666 --> 00:47:10,874
I mean, of course, yes.

875
00:47:10,875 --> 00:47:12,165
- One moment, Mira.
- Thank you.

876
00:47:12,166 --> 00:47:14,665
And who may I tell them
you're with?

877
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:16,915
Me? I'm, I'm...

878
00:47:16,916 --> 00:47:19,332
Uh... Doctor...

879
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:22,791
uh, Doctor Plan-ing Guy.

880
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:25,666
Doc... Doctor Planning Guy?

881
00:47:26,666 --> 00:47:28,582
Doctor Guy Planning.

882
00:47:28,583 --> 00:47:29,749
It's my stage name.

883
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:32,624
You... you probably
recognize me.

884
00:47:32,625 --> 00:47:35,250
I'm afraid I don't, Doctor Guy.

885
00:47:35,958 --> 00:47:37,833
I'm... I'm... I'm very famous.

886
00:47:38,416 --> 00:47:40,415
Oh, I'm sure.
Let me just check the schedule.

887
00:47:40,416 --> 00:47:42,416
Uh, no, you won't find
my name there.

888
00:47:43,416 --> 00:47:45,082
My office called in today,

889
00:47:45,083 --> 00:47:46,665
and they just told us
to stop by.

890
00:47:46,666 --> 00:47:47,624
-  Yeah.
- Yeah.

891
00:47:47,625 --> 00:47:48,665
Please, could you hurry?

892
00:47:48,666 --> 00:47:49,874
We don't like
to be kept waiting.

893
00:47:49,875 --> 00:47:51,375
-  Of course, sure.
- Thank you.

894
00:47:52,791 --> 00:47:55,082
"Doctor Guy Planning"?

895
00:47:55,083 --> 00:47:58,540
- What is wrong with you?
- Would you cut me some slack?

896
00:47:58,541 --> 00:48:00,499
I'm a mechanic, not an actor.

897
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,874
But it's a stupid name.

898
00:48:01,875 --> 00:48:02,875
Mira!

899
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,999
Oh. What a nice surprise.

900
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,540
I'm terribly sorry,

901
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:09,415
I wasn't made aware
of your appointment.

902
00:48:09,416 --> 00:48:10,665
And you're not alone.

903
00:48:10,666 --> 00:48:12,540
- No, this is...
- Oh, Doctor Guy...

904
00:48:12,541 --> 00:48:14,457
Planning. I'm famous.

905
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:15,415
Very famous.

906
00:48:15,416 --> 00:48:16,875
You look familiar.

907
00:48:17,458 --> 00:48:19,874
And now, what can I do for you?

908
00:48:19,875 --> 00:48:20,958
Um...

909
00:48:22,416 --> 00:48:24,750
I hope this can stay between us.

910
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:28,790
I'd like to avoid
all the media attention.

911
00:48:28,791 --> 00:48:31,249
You understand what I mean?
We're not...

912
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:33,457
- Oh.
- ...going public with it yet.

913
00:48:33,458 --> 00:48:34,624
- I see.
-  So...

914
00:48:34,625 --> 00:48:36,749
Good thinking, Ms. Mira.

915
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:39,666
You can trust my discretion.
Strictly confidential.

916
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:43,290
Have you already decided
which improvement you would like

917
00:48:43,291 --> 00:48:44,666
for your future child?

918
00:48:45,583 --> 00:48:46,250
I'm sorry?

919
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:47,999
We have many options.

920
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,749
Uh, increased physical strength.

921
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:52,540
Or allow me to say, your beauty?

922
00:48:52,541 --> 00:48:54,290
Or maybe your
incomparable voice?

923
00:48:54,291 --> 00:48:56,832
All of this is possible.
You just need to choose.

924
00:48:56,833 --> 00:49:00,124
Listen, Doc, can I...
can I call you Doc?

925
00:49:00,125 --> 00:49:02,832
Since we're both doctors.

926
00:49:02,833 --> 00:49:04,249
Seriously, though, Doc.

927
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:06,624
Uh, before committing,
I wanna make sure

928
00:49:06,625 --> 00:49:08,999
that my girl, my princess,

929
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,875
gets the best
treatment available.

930
00:49:12,041 --> 00:49:13,665
Can we have a look around
your hospital?

931
00:49:13,666 --> 00:49:14,915
Oh, hey...

932
00:49:14,916 --> 00:49:16,915
Our clinic is the very best,
I can assure you.

933
00:49:16,916 --> 00:49:18,290
We're the only ones
in this country

934
00:49:18,291 --> 00:49:21,000
providing the most advanced
prenatal improvements.

935
00:49:22,291 --> 00:49:23,624
Unfortunately, uh...

936
00:49:23,625 --> 00:49:26,040
- The Senator Kessler's visit--
- Oh, yeah.

937
00:49:26,041 --> 00:49:27,790
No, mad respect for that,
mad respect.

938
00:49:27,791 --> 00:49:30,000
But I really need to see
what I'm buying.

939
00:49:31,791 --> 00:49:32,750
Certainly.

940
00:49:33,916 --> 00:49:36,208
Okay. Uh, follow me, then.

941
00:49:44,958 --> 00:49:47,165
The Family Planning Center
will celebrate its

942
00:49:47,166 --> 00:49:49,290
thirtieth birthday next year.

943
00:49:49,291 --> 00:49:51,207
We've provided
impeccable improvements

944
00:49:51,208 --> 00:49:54,665
to celebrities such as
Felicity Pugh, Bob Jenkins,

945
00:49:54,666 --> 00:49:56,249
and, well, now you.

946
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:59,333
Your wonderful voice
was one of our designs.

947
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:02,958
Sorry.

948
00:50:04,166 --> 00:50:06,750
- Doctor...
-  <i>Leon. They're here.</i>

949
00:50:08,458 --> 00:50:11,082
Yo, Doc, thank you so much!

950
00:50:11,083 --> 00:50:12,582
We are so grateful

951
00:50:12,583 --> 00:50:14,540
and impressed
with your facility.

952
00:50:14,541 --> 00:50:16,208
We have a little
surprise for you.

953
00:50:16,791 --> 00:50:20,207
Mira is gonna perform
a special private gig

954
00:50:20,208 --> 00:50:22,624
just for you and your staff
right now.

955
00:50:22,625 --> 00:50:25,124
- No, it's not really necessary--
- No. We insist, we insist.

956
00:50:25,125 --> 00:50:26,124
Guys, everyone!

957
00:50:26,125 --> 00:50:27,540
Ladies and gentlemen!

958
00:50:27,541 --> 00:50:31,290
Mira herself is gonna
perform just for you.

959
00:50:31,291 --> 00:50:33,040
One-time private gig!

960
00:50:33,041 --> 00:50:34,540
- It's gonna be cool!
-  Hi, everyone. Thank you.

961
00:50:34,541 --> 00:50:36,665
Yes, I have
a couple of new songs,

962
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:38,915
if you wanna follow me.

963
00:50:38,916 --> 00:50:40,499
Yeah. Follow me, everyone!

964
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,415
That's right.
Come on in. Come on.

965
00:50:58,041 --> 00:50:59,291
Hey, boneheads!

966
00:51:00,583 --> 00:51:02,415
You again, Flower Man?

967
00:51:02,416 --> 00:51:03,874
You got lucky last time.

968
00:51:03,875 --> 00:51:06,625
Come on.
Don't worry, I won't bite.

969
00:51:08,625 --> 00:51:11,040
Ugh. Let's get
this freakshow over with.

970
00:51:11,041 --> 00:51:13,083
Grab him by his petals, boys.

971
00:51:14,208 --> 00:51:15,250
Come on.

972
00:51:22,458 --> 00:51:24,082
I made
a few improvements.

973
00:51:24,083 --> 00:51:25,290
It won't mean a thing.

974
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:26,291
Get him!

975
00:51:53,416 --> 00:51:55,582
You'll pay for that, you freak.

976
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:26,625
-  Let's get out of here.
-  Let's go!

977
00:52:27,958 --> 00:52:28,915
Stay right there!
Don't move!

978
00:52:28,916 --> 00:52:30,125
Hold your fire.

979
00:52:36,708 --> 00:52:38,875
Dad?

980
00:52:41,708 --> 00:52:42,833
What?

981
00:52:44,041 --> 00:52:44,915
Mira?

982
00:52:44,916 --> 00:52:46,540
Mira.

983
00:52:46,541 --> 00:52:47,833
Leon?

984
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,124
I'm sorry.

985
00:52:51,125 --> 00:52:52,832
I warned him about this.

986
00:52:52,833 --> 00:52:55,125
He told me everything.
He's here to help.

987
00:52:59,208 --> 00:53:00,083
I don't understand.

988
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:02,083
Why did you just let him go?

989
00:53:02,791 --> 00:53:04,791
'Cause you're all
that matters to me, son.

990
00:53:05,958 --> 00:53:06,958
That's why.

991
00:53:07,625 --> 00:53:08,833
Son?

992
00:53:11,416 --> 00:53:12,500
He's your dad?

993
00:53:15,416 --> 00:53:18,000
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Look, Chloe.

994
00:53:20,375 --> 00:53:21,208
I'm sorry.

995
00:53:22,958 --> 00:53:24,083
So, you're...

996
00:53:25,125 --> 00:53:27,749
- You're one of them.
-  No.

997
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:30,707
No. Chloe. Chloe!

998
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:32,750
It's all right, son.
You did good.

999
00:53:34,166 --> 00:53:35,208
I'm proud of you.

1000
00:53:36,333 --> 00:53:37,540
- You're safe.
-  Mira!

1001
00:53:37,541 --> 00:53:38,541
Mira! Why are you here?

1002
00:53:41,708 --> 00:53:43,749
My son is proof
that the disparity

1003
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:46,666
between Genetics and Specials
has gone too far.

1004
00:53:48,208 --> 00:53:50,582
Tomorrow, we vote
for Proposition 42,

1005
00:53:50,583 --> 00:53:52,541
and then the healing can begin.

1006
00:53:53,833 --> 00:53:56,000
Genetic unity for all!

1007
00:53:57,291 --> 00:53:59,250
Senator. Se... Senator?

1008
00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:03,875
Senator, over here!

1009
00:54:04,458 --> 00:54:05,750
Just a moment of your time.

1010
00:54:07,666 --> 00:54:10,874
<i>Today, the Senate voted
in favor of Proposition 42,</i>

1011
00:54:10,875 --> 00:54:14,249
<i>which will enable postnatal
improvements on all citizens.</i>

1012
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:17,165
<i>After last week's attack
on the Family Planning Center,</i>

1013
00:54:17,166 --> 00:54:18,540
<i>the Proposition 42,</i>

1014
00:54:18,541 --> 00:54:20,665
<i>locally backed
by Senator Kessler,</i>

1015
00:54:20,666 --> 00:54:23,165
<i>was met with
near-unanimous approval.</i>

1016
00:54:23,166 --> 00:54:25,874
<i>Earlier, Senator Kessler
and his security team</i>

1017
00:54:25,875 --> 00:54:28,540
<i>appeared at the scene
in the Family Planning Center.</i>

1018
00:54:28,541 --> 00:54:31,707
<i>There, they managed to stop
an Anti-Genetic Squad attack,</i>

1019
00:54:31,708 --> 00:54:32,957
<i>saving many lives.</i>

1020
00:54:32,958 --> 00:54:34,207
<i>Preparations for the new</i>

1021
00:54:34,208 --> 00:54:35,957
<i>genetic treatments
are underway.</i>

1022
00:54:35,958 --> 00:54:38,040
<i>Starting today,
Special citizens</i>

1023
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:40,290
<i>will be transported
to a new medical camp</i>

1024
00:54:40,291 --> 00:54:41,874
<i>established outside the city.</i>

1025
00:54:41,875 --> 00:54:43,290
<i>After the new treatments,</i>

1026
00:54:43,291 --> 00:54:45,332
<i>the Special District borders
will be opened,</i>

1027
00:54:45,333 --> 00:54:46,874
<i>and the newly improved citizens</i>

1028
00:54:46,875 --> 00:54:49,540
<i>will be allowed to join
the Genetic population,</i>

1029
00:54:49,541 --> 00:54:51,832
<i>creating, according
to Senator Kessler,</i>

1030
00:54:51,833 --> 00:54:54,291
<i>a new, more unified
future for all.</i>

1031
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:09,707
<i>Special citizens,
you are required</i>

1032
00:55:09,708 --> 00:55:10,707
<i>to follow directions
to the designated</i>

1033
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:12,124
<i>unloading zones.</i>

1034
00:55:12,125 --> 00:55:14,250
<i>Please remain calm and proceed
in an orderly fashion.</i>

1035
00:55:42,916 --> 00:55:44,540
You'll be staying here
until we complete

1036
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:45,833
the procedure, then you're...

1037
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,583
free to do as you wish.

1038
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,083
Chloe...

1039
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:54,249
What happened to Chloe?

1040
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:55,458
The girl I was with.

1041
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:57,207
Where'd she go?

1042
00:55:57,208 --> 00:55:58,375
She ran away.

1043
00:55:59,375 --> 00:56:00,790
But we're looking for her.

1044
00:56:00,791 --> 00:56:03,333
And I promise I'll let you know
as soon as we find her.

1045
00:56:04,541 --> 00:56:05,541
And Hughes?

1046
00:56:07,708 --> 00:56:10,041
You know he's the leader
of the Anti-Genetics.

1047
00:56:12,041 --> 00:56:13,374
Why has he not been arrested?

1048
00:56:13,375 --> 00:56:16,333
Right now, you need
to focus on yourself, son.

1049
00:56:20,416 --> 00:56:21,750
I let everybody down.

1050
00:56:23,458 --> 00:56:24,457
I want my suit back.

1051
00:56:24,458 --> 00:56:25,999
I... I need my suit back.

1052
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:26,958
Where is it?

1053
00:56:28,041 --> 00:56:29,833
You don't need
that suit anymore.

1054
00:56:31,083 --> 00:56:33,416
Now that I've found you,
I am gonna cure you.

1055
00:56:38,291 --> 00:56:39,583
Just like you cured Mom?

1056
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:49,708
Leonard.

1057
00:56:53,208 --> 00:56:55,208
I did what I thought was best...

1058
00:56:56,958 --> 00:56:58,291
to try and fix you.

1059
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:01,583
I was wrong.

1060
00:57:03,208 --> 00:57:05,375
I shouldn't have listened
to those idiot doctors.

1061
00:57:06,666 --> 00:57:08,832
Well, you were the one that

1062
00:57:08,833 --> 00:57:10,416
let them experiment.

1063
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,083
I loved your mother.

1064
00:57:26,958 --> 00:57:28,083
So much.

1065
00:57:30,416 --> 00:57:31,500
So much.

1066
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,041
And...

1067
00:57:38,208 --> 00:57:40,500
I made a terrible mistake.

1068
00:57:47,166 --> 00:57:48,333
She left you a letter.

1069
00:57:50,375 --> 00:57:53,833
And I was so afraid
of what you would do...

1070
00:57:55,333 --> 00:57:56,750
that I never gave it to you.

1071
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:01,000
And then you disappeared.

1072
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:24,791
<i>Dear Leon,
this is your mother.</i>

1073
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:28,375
<i>I'm happy to have a chance
to see you and hold you.</i>

1074
00:58:29,125 --> 00:58:31,375
<i>Unfortunately,
we have to part soon.</i>

1075
00:58:32,083 --> 00:58:35,958
<i>I believe you'll become
a kind person, free and open.</i>

1076
00:58:36,875 --> 00:58:39,832
<i>The only thing I'm afraid of
is that you'll hate your father</i>

1077
00:58:39,833 --> 00:58:41,791
<i>and your heart
will become hardened.</i>

1078
00:58:42,875 --> 00:58:44,790
<i>Life can be cruel, son.</i>

1079
00:58:44,791 --> 00:58:46,707
<i>We have to learn to forgive,</i>

1080
00:58:46,708 --> 00:58:48,916
<i>no matter how difficult
it might be.</i>

1081
00:58:49,875 --> 00:58:53,207
<i>After all, no matter
what happens to us,</i>

1082
00:58:53,208 --> 00:58:54,999
<i>despite all of the mistakes,</i>

1083
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,125
<i>family stays with you
until the end.</i>

1084
00:58:57,875 --> 00:58:59,582
<i>We are all the same.</i>

1085
00:58:59,583 --> 00:59:01,166
<i>We are all equal.</i>

1086
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,041
<i>I love you.</i>

1087
00:59:10,666 --> 00:59:12,250
She wanted you to forgive me.

1088
00:59:27,375 --> 00:59:28,750
I'm gonna take care of him.

1089
00:59:30,791 --> 00:59:32,250
They won't
stay here long.

1090
00:59:33,333 --> 00:59:36,291
Your father said they'd be given
treatment as soon as possible.

1091
00:59:37,458 --> 00:59:39,290
Does anybody have some water?

1092
00:59:39,291 --> 00:59:42,916
And you will walk home
on your own.

1093
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:47,625
Chloe?

1094
00:59:53,291 --> 00:59:54,083
Chloe!

1095
00:59:55,916 --> 00:59:56,750
Chloe!

1096
01:00:02,083 --> 01:00:03,583
They told me you ran away.

1097
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:13,874
Believe it or not,
I missed you so much.

1098
01:00:20,125 --> 01:00:21,083
Me too.

1099
01:00:22,833 --> 01:00:23,665
Almost.

1100
01:00:25,166 --> 01:00:26,791
Come on.

1101
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:28,790
Okay, you all right?

1102
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:30,749
You know I'm all right.
Why didn't you tell me?

1103
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:32,707
Are you now one of them?

1104
01:00:32,708 --> 01:00:33,832
I don't know. I...

1105
01:00:36,583 --> 01:00:37,707
I'm one of you.

1106
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:43,416
Mira.

1107
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:47,249
Why did you warn my dad?

1108
01:00:48,208 --> 01:00:49,957
You could have been killed.

1109
01:00:49,958 --> 01:00:51,583
I had to do something.

1110
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:53,416
Don't you see that...

1111
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:56,958
he's the one behind all of this?

1112
01:00:57,541 --> 01:00:59,541
The gang,
the attack on the Genetics.

1113
01:01:00,208 --> 01:01:03,166
Why would Kessler
be behind all this?

1114
01:01:03,958 --> 01:01:06,458
Who stands to benefit
the most from all of this?

1115
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:08,041
Him.

1116
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:11,999
His project is now supported
by the Senate.

1117
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,249
Yes, but his project is meant
to save Specials' lives.

1118
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:18,249
I mean, he found the cure.

1119
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:19,915
Why would he support the gang

1120
01:01:19,916 --> 01:01:21,874
- that wants to kill the...
- I don't know. I don't know.

1121
01:01:21,875 --> 01:01:22,790
I don't know.

1122
01:01:22,791 --> 01:01:23,958
Hey, Leon.

1123
01:01:24,541 --> 01:01:25,915
If Kessler's plan is real,

1124
01:01:25,916 --> 01:01:27,999
I won't be needing
your service anymore.

1125
01:01:29,458 --> 01:01:31,166
I wouldn't be so sure, buddy.

1126
01:01:31,958 --> 01:01:33,458
There's something about this...

1127
01:01:34,125 --> 01:01:35,874
...that stinks like a dead rat.

1128
01:01:35,875 --> 01:01:39,249
You're gonna need more
than a dead rat to prove it.

1129
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:41,375
The lab, the lab.

1130
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,082
The laboratory.

1131
01:01:43,083 --> 01:01:45,540
If...
if I'm right about my dad,

1132
01:01:45,541 --> 01:01:48,540
then, uh, the answer
is in the lab.

1133
01:01:48,541 --> 01:01:49,665
We just...

1134
01:01:49,666 --> 01:01:51,333
We need to find a way
to get the proof.

1135
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:53,416
The cam.

1136
01:01:56,875 --> 01:01:58,750
-  What?
- The cam.

1137
01:02:00,375 --> 01:02:03,999
Maybe you're not just a...
an annoying little squirrel.

1138
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,915
Shut up, old man.

1139
01:02:05,916 --> 01:02:06,957
Shh.

1140
01:02:06,958 --> 01:02:08,416
- Just leave it to me.
- Okay, okay.

1141
01:02:09,083 --> 01:02:10,082
Buddy?

1142
01:02:10,083 --> 01:02:11,166
Yeah?

1143
01:02:12,083 --> 01:02:14,458
How's that camera
working out for you?

1144
01:02:32,041 --> 01:02:33,458
You, come with us.

1145
01:02:35,291 --> 01:02:36,083
This one?

1146
01:02:36,833 --> 01:02:38,041
Yes. That one.

1147
01:02:39,083 --> 01:02:40,000
Move it!

1148
01:02:55,791 --> 01:02:57,082
Please lift your arm.

1149
01:02:57,083 --> 01:02:59,375
This will sting a little.

1150
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:16,083
<i>- You did good.
- Thank you.</i>

1151
01:03:17,166 --> 01:03:18,666
I knew it.

1152
01:03:19,583 --> 01:03:22,041
So that's what it's all about.

1153
01:03:24,708 --> 01:03:26,291
And how does it all work?

1154
01:03:27,458 --> 01:03:31,665
<i>Honestly, I don't fully
understand your plan, Frank.</i>

1155
01:03:31,666 --> 01:03:32,708
I'll show you.

1156
01:03:33,958 --> 01:03:36,790
First, we extract
the necessary biomaterial

1157
01:03:36,791 --> 01:03:38,124
from the donor's brain.

1158
01:03:38,125 --> 01:03:39,374
He won't feel a thing.

1159
01:03:39,375 --> 01:03:40,708
It's completely painless.

1160
01:03:47,916 --> 01:03:48,791
Almost.

1161
01:03:58,291 --> 01:03:59,083
Then...

1162
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:02,874
We mix the biomaterial

1163
01:04:02,875 --> 01:04:05,708
with the variant
of the gene modification.

1164
01:04:12,333 --> 01:04:14,707
The donor's untouched genome

1165
01:04:14,708 --> 01:04:19,040
binds with the
genetic enhancement

1166
01:04:19,041 --> 01:04:20,000
and...

1167
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:23,291
Voila!

1168
01:04:24,875 --> 01:04:26,500
We have the essence.

1169
01:04:27,666 --> 01:04:29,040
Which allows us to instill

1170
01:04:29,041 --> 01:04:31,040
any enhancement
into any Genetic,

1171
01:04:31,041 --> 01:04:33,458
regardless of age,
and without limit.

1172
01:04:34,833 --> 01:04:37,415
It's a goddamn miracle.

1173
01:04:37,416 --> 01:04:40,416
We've cracked the enigma
of human evolution.

1174
01:04:43,375 --> 01:04:46,375
You promised the Senate
you'd treat the Specials.

1175
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,957
I hope we're not
going to waste your miracle

1176
01:04:49,958 --> 01:04:51,583
on some human garbage.

1177
01:04:52,291 --> 01:04:54,916
Curing my son is all
that matters to me.

1178
01:04:57,958 --> 01:05:00,750
<i>As for the rest of them,
there's nothing we can do.</i>

1179
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:07,374
Their genetic disposition
prevents their evolution.

1180
01:05:07,375 --> 01:05:11,250
Harvesting them is
the only humane solution.

1181
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:13,958
It's the...

1182
01:05:15,458 --> 01:05:16,791
loving thing to do.

1183
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:20,416
Great!

1184
01:05:21,791 --> 01:05:24,457
Because I've been waiting
for some new additions

1185
01:05:24,458 --> 01:05:26,000
for quite a while.

1186
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,625
<i>Get this garbage out of here.</i>

1187
01:05:53,041 --> 01:05:56,333
<i>The necessary biomaterial
from the donor's brain.</i>

1188
01:05:57,166 --> 01:05:59,666
<i>He won't feel a thing.
It's completely painless.</i>

1189
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,832
- I'm sorry.
-  No, it's okay.

1190
01:06:11,833 --> 01:06:14,457
I'm so sorry.
I didn't know. I had no idea.

1191
01:06:14,458 --> 01:06:15,791
Hey, hey.

1192
01:06:16,666 --> 01:06:19,416
I'm sorry.

1193
01:06:20,583 --> 01:06:21,665
- It's okay.
-  I'm sorry.

1194
01:06:21,666 --> 01:06:23,249
Mira, no,
this is not your fault.

1195
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:24,125
It's not your fault.

1196
01:06:29,708 --> 01:06:30,625
Listen.

1197
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,458
The question is,

1198
01:06:35,083 --> 01:06:36,625
what are we gonna do about it?

1199
01:06:41,708 --> 01:06:43,833
So, what are we gonna do?

1200
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:51,375
We fight!

1201
01:06:53,333 --> 01:06:54,582
-  Fight?
- With what?

1202
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,874
With... with...

1203
01:06:57,875 --> 01:06:59,083
with anything we've got!

1204
01:06:59,958 --> 01:07:01,874
All we have to do is just...

1205
01:07:01,875 --> 01:07:04,332
just... just hold them off
until the police come.

1206
01:07:04,333 --> 01:07:05,666
That's all we have to do.

1207
01:07:06,583 --> 01:07:08,040
It'll be a slaughter.

1208
01:07:08,041 --> 01:07:09,750
No, no.

1209
01:07:12,666 --> 01:07:14,333
That's what they want you
to think.

1210
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:15,916
All right?

1211
01:07:17,125 --> 01:07:18,665
That you're useless

1212
01:07:18,666 --> 01:07:20,375
and you're worthless.

1213
01:07:20,958 --> 01:07:22,208
It's not true!

1214
01:07:23,666 --> 01:07:24,541
It's that we're...

1215
01:07:28,083 --> 01:07:29,333
We're all one.

1216
01:07:31,166 --> 01:07:33,208
We're all equal.

1217
01:07:37,583 --> 01:07:40,499
I just need my damn suit.

1218
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:41,750
I know where they keep it.

1219
01:07:42,958 --> 01:07:44,000
The storeroom.

1220
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:50,666
- We're gonna fight.
- We fight!

1221
01:07:51,375 --> 01:07:52,833
- Yeah.
- We fight!

1222
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:54,832
We fight!

1223
01:08:05,416 --> 01:08:07,083
Today is the day, Leonard.

1224
01:08:08,208 --> 01:08:09,999
First, I'm gonna cure you,

1225
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,875
then the rest of the world.

1226
01:08:12,958 --> 01:08:15,708
- Ow!
- Don't call me that.

1227
01:08:16,333 --> 01:08:17,832
Tell me, Dad.

1228
01:08:17,833 --> 01:08:21,375
Tell me, where exactly did
you get this essence from, huh?

1229
01:08:22,583 --> 01:08:23,916
I know everything.

1230
01:08:25,416 --> 01:08:27,666
Your dealings with Hughes,
the gang.

1231
01:08:28,541 --> 01:08:29,749
Killing all those
innocent people

1232
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:31,665
for your own pathetic ego!

1233
01:08:31,666 --> 01:08:33,499
Oh, it's so much more than that.

1234
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,541
It's evolution,
and you can't stop it.

1235
01:08:40,666 --> 01:08:42,083
I gotta ask you one question.

1236
01:08:42,666 --> 01:08:43,707
Why?

1237
01:08:43,708 --> 01:08:46,000
You were supposed
to be born a Genetic!

1238
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:48,332
You're not a Special.

1239
01:08:48,333 --> 01:08:50,000
You were always one of us.

1240
01:08:52,083 --> 01:08:54,000
With the Specials'
untouched genome,

1241
01:08:54,791 --> 01:08:56,874
I can cure every illness,

1242
01:08:56,875 --> 01:08:58,207
every disability,

1243
01:08:58,208 --> 01:08:59,957
and we'll ascend
to the next level

1244
01:08:59,958 --> 01:09:01,915
on the evolutionary ladder!

1245
01:09:01,916 --> 01:09:05,166
And it all starts
with you, Leonard!

1246
01:09:06,458 --> 01:09:07,416
My only son.

1247
01:09:08,375 --> 01:09:11,041
You did all of this to help me?

1248
01:09:12,291 --> 01:09:13,416
To cure me?

1249
01:09:15,708 --> 01:09:16,958
There's only one thing, Dad.

1250
01:09:18,333 --> 01:09:19,666
I'm not the one who's sick.

1251
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:21,416
You are.

1252
01:09:23,208 --> 01:09:24,166
Leonard...

1253
01:09:26,166 --> 01:09:27,332
Leonard!

1254
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:30,415
Chloe, tell me
you've got some more ammo!

1255
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:32,291
Why? Did you use
all of them up again?

1256
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:34,500
You wouldn't get far without me.

1257
01:09:35,458 --> 01:09:37,332
- Okay, so I've got...
- What you got?

1258
01:09:37,333 --> 01:09:39,915
- Two wings, here.
- Okay.

1259
01:09:39,916 --> 01:09:42,249
Two wings, one spikes,
two pollen, one roots.

1260
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:43,374
Uh-huh.

1261
01:09:43,375 --> 01:09:45,375
I guess that's all.
No, wait!

1262
01:09:48,791 --> 01:09:50,750
- One acid fruit.
- One?

1263
01:09:51,458 --> 01:09:52,457
That's the last one.

1264
01:09:53,625 --> 01:09:55,791
Please use it wisely,
Flower Man.

1265
01:09:56,875 --> 01:09:58,624

Chloe, Hughes will be here
any minute.

1270

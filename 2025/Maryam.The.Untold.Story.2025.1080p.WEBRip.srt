{\an8}INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY
PODCAST <i>"BELENGGU JIN KAFIR"</i>

4
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:32,208
- If you'll excuse me.
- Take care.

5
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:51,125
<i>Maryam.</i>

6
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,875
My name is Maryam.

7
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:02,375
I'm going to tell a story

8
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,708
I've never shared with anyone.

9
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:10,791
I've been living alongside
a king of the jinns

10
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:13,583
who claims to love me.

11
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,916
Based on what I know,

12
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:22,916
he's from the highest rank of jinn.

13
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:25,750
I can't say his name,

14
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,083
because I know

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,583
he's behind me right now.

16
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:52,000
- Isn't that Maryam?
- Yeah.

17
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:54,291
She's always by herself.

18
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,958
I heard she hangs out with demons.

19
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:59,500
What a weirdo.

20
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:02,833
Why won't the other kids play with me?

21
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,583
They say I'm weird, that I talk to myself.

22
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,125
They say you're evil,
even though you're kind.

23
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:15,125
You always give me money for popsicles.

24
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:17,541
Let's play.

25
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,916
- Weirdo!
- What a freak!

26
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,625
She's friends with demons!

27
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,166
She's gone?

28
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,708
He's not a demon! He's kind!

29
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:48,541
Prophet Muhammad spread Islam
with his close companions,

30
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:52,208
and Abu Bakr As-Siddiq was among them.

31
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:58,375
His full name was Abdullah ibn Abu Quhafa.

32
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,208
I WILL ALWAYS PROTECT YOU

33
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:05,125
"As-Siddiq" meaning "the truthful"
was a title given to him by the Prophet.

34
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,125
Maryam.

35
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,458
Why don't you explain the history
of Adam and Eve?

36
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:24,291
<i>Ifrit jinn have been around
since the days of Prophet Sulaiman...</i>

37
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:27,791
Ifrit jinn have been around
since the days of Prophet Sulaiman.

38
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:32,958
One that helped move the Queen
of Sheba's throne to Prophet Sulaiman,

39
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,416
which resulted in her embracing Islam.

40
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,458
This jinn is notoriously
powerful and ruthless.

41
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:39,541
Maryam!

42
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,750
How did you even come up with that?

43
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,500
Are you possessed or something?

44
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:45,666
Maryam.

45
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,416
You sure are friends with demons!

46
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,291
Silence, everyone!

47
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:59,500
- You're one of them!
- Demon!

48
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,708
He's my friend, not a demon!

49
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,250
You're the evil ones!

50
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:29,416
No!

51
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:38,166
Ifrit jinn have been around
since the days of Prophet Sulaiman.

52
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,958
One that helped move the Queen of Sheba's
throne to Prophet Sulaiman,

53
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,833
Help!

54
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,416
Oh, my God! I seek forgiveness from God!

55
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,916
Stop!

56
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:13,666
No!

57
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,833
- Forgive me! Forgive me!
- Help!

58
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,291
Help!

59
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,250
Forgive me!

60
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:30,333
Cruel! You're cruel!

61
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,333
You're cruel!

62
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:37,166
You're cruel!

63
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,458
You went too far!

64
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:43,625
I seek refuge in Allah
from the outcast Shaitan.

65
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,333
In God's name, the Most Gracious,
the Most Merciful.

66
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:51,500
God, protect me
from the Shaitan's whispers,

67
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:56,291
and I seek protection

68
00:06:56,375 --> 00:07:01,041
so they don't get near me.

69
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,625
In God's name, the Most Gracious,
the Most Merciful.

70
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:08,833
Allah, there is no god except Him.

71
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,916
He is always alive and never sleeps.

72
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,416
Everything in the skies and the earth
belongs to Him.

73
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:20,333
No one can speak to Him on behalf
of anyone else, unless He allows it.

74
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:24,666
He knows what happened
and what will happen.

75
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:30,583
No one can know anything about Him
unless He wants them to.

76
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:34,541
His throne is bigger
than the skies and the earth.

77
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:39,666
He doesn't get tired of guarding them,
He is the Most High, the Greatest.

78
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,250
In God's name, the Most Gracious,
the Most Merciful.

79
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,958
Say He is Allah, the One.

80
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,583
Allah, the Eternal Refuge.

81
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,833
He does not give birth, nor was He born.

82
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,750
And there is nothing equal to Him.

83
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,875
{\an8}Pitiful mortals!

84
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,458
{\an8}The child belongs to me!

85
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,333
Who are you?

86
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,333
What is your name?

87
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:11,375
Who are you?

88
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:16,041
{\an8}I've been by her side
since the day she was born.

89
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:20,583
{\an8}Moving as the Earth spins,

90
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,958
{\an8}like wind through the air,

91
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,708
{\an8}like water to the waves.

92
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,250
{\an8}Which tribe do you belong to?

93
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,458
{\an8}Ifrit.

94
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:24,166
By invoking the name of Allah,
no harm shall come

95
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,291
from anything in the heavens or the earth.

96
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:31,541
Truly, He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing.

97
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:35,125
By invoking the name of Allah,
no harm shall come

98
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:38,458
from anything in the heavens or the earth...

99
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,791
By invoking the name of Allah,
no harm shall come

100
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,083
from anything in the heavens or the earth.

101
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,625
Truly, He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing.

102
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:03,000
By invoking the name of Allah,
no harm shall come

103
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,083
from anything in the heavens or the earth.

104
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,708
Truly, He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing.

105
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:10,625
By invoking the name of Allah,
no harm shall come

106
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:13,041
from anything in the heavens or the earth...

107
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:43,458
I seek refuge in Allah
from the outcast Shaitan.

108
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:47,250
In God's name, the Most Gracious,
the Most Merciful.

109
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:49,708
Thank God.

110
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,916
To put it simply,

111
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:57,166
jinn can take on any shape

112
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:01,250
and enter humans
through all kinds of ways.

113
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:04,916
It could be through haram food

114
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,416
dirty money,

115
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,958
or unclean places.

116
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,125
It could be anything.

117
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,666
Only Allah knows for sure.

118
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,125
What should we do, Kyai?

119
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,041
Is Maryam going to need constant <i>ruqyah?</i>

120
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:22,750
For how long?

121
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:33,583
The jinn attached to Maryam

122
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:37,416
is the king of all jinns.

123
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:39,458
An Ifrit.

124
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:47,000
According to Wahb ibn Munabbih
and Abu Salih,

125
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:52,708
Ifrit is as massive as a mountain.

126
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:57,208
The Ifrit is an ancient jinn
believed to have existed

127
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,083
even before Prophet Adam.

128
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:04,208
This jinn is known to be powerful, violent

129
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,458
and dangerous.

130
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:11,791
They are also commonly involved
in black magic practices.

131
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,541
I see.

132
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,625
Maryam mentioned that.

133
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:21,458
I thought she was just making it up.

134
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:26,208
I'm not sure how Maryam

135
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,083
ended up attached to Ifrit,

136
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:34,000
but I promise that from now on,

137
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,125
I will help protect her.

138
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:46,208
Our position as humans
is above that of the jinn.

139
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,458
God willing, we can overcome this.

140
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,208
Maryam,

141
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,083
do you like

142
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,583
your friend?

143
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:02,791
Yeah.

144
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:07,000
But he hurt my classmates.

145
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:08,916
I don't like that.

146
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:10,500
Kyai,

147
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,750
my friend won't bother me anymore, right?

148
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:15,875
God willing.

149
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:21,916
If this keeps up, the other kids
won't want to be my friends.

150
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,541
Just make sure you don't give up.

151
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,458
Thank you, Kyai.

152
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,166
We should go.

153
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,291
Okay.

154
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:50,541
- Peace be upon you.
- And upon you peace.

155
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:05,791
Farhan.

156
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,500
Rizki.

157
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,833
Is she okay, Kyai?

158
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,000
If God wills.

159
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:18,041
How's your Al-Qiyamah memorization?

160
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,833
- Thank God, I've memorized it.
- Thank God.

161
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,916
- And you?
- Not yet, Kyai.

162
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,083
Come on, let's hear it.

163
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:30,458
I seek refuge in Allah
from the outcast Shaitan.

164
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:37,041
Mom, my friend
won't bother me anymore, right?

165
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:41,500
If God wills, dear.

166
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,125
Maryam,

167
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:06,166
someone's outside,
the one who gave you the necklace.

168
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,250
The necklace looks great on you.

169
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,250
You look beautiful.

170
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:46,916
Shall we?

171
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:51,666
See you, Aunty!

172
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:35,875
Oh, God!

173
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,083
Wait here.

174
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,416
Come on.

175
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:08,625
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

176
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:16,333
Come on, Bagas. I keep telling you.

177
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,458
You wanna end up like me?

178
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,791
That's just you being reckless, Adi.

179
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,625
Sorry, he doesn't mean it.

180
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,625
No, this is on me.

181
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,708
I'll take you home.

182
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:36,458
Bagas!

183
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:37,541
Yes, sir?

184
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,250
Are you and Bagas dating?

185
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:56,791
He drives you around now, huh?

186
00:18:56,875 --> 00:19:01,250
If you have a boyfriend,
is your demon buddy cool with it?

187
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:04,875
Don't want Bagas ending up like Adi,
with a hole in his head.

188
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:08,916
You'll break his heart at this rate.

189
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:13,291
I think it's too late.
He gave her a necklace.

190
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,000
New necklace, how nice.

191
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,958
{\an8}Maryam is so lucky.

192
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,500
{\an8}Getting gifts from demons and guys.

193
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:29,541
Mar, is it true
your demon friend gives you money?

194
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:30,833
We'd like some too.

195
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,916
Watch it. He'll haunt you too.

196
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,750
Where is he, then?

197
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,333
You're asking for trouble!

198
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:40,666
Mr. Taufiq said we're low on fish.

199
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,916
Come with me to the bay after maghrib.

200
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,958
- The bay?
- Yeah.

201
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,833
That's where demons get freaky!

202
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:50,500
- What demon gets freaky?
- Mar, you're filling in for Kiki.

203
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,458
Yeah, you should go, Mar!

204
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,583
You have Bagas to protect you.

205
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,333
You'll be fine.

206
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,375
This place is actually creepy.

207
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,666
Kiki was right.

208
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,875
This is where the demons get freaky.

209
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,041
I shouldn't have come.

210
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:43,583
Don't worry.

211
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,291
We've got a devil on our side.

212
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,125
My forehead is still scarred
from last time.

213
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,583
Watch your mouth and shut it!

214
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:55,958
We've got work to do.

215
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,916
Maryam's friend literally
is a king of the jinn, though.

216
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,041
Demons getting freaky don't even compare.

217
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,583
Ask her yourself.

218
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:15,333
Maryam, didn't you head out
with Eka and Bagas?

219
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:16,625
They left already?

220
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:21,208
Help! Mr. Taufiq!
The ones at the bay got possessed!

221
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,208
No!

222
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,333
Don't bother my friends!

223
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:56,333
Stop!

224
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:14,208
I swear, Maryam and I went to the bay!

225
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,791
No, Maryam's here.

226
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:19,791
She was with me, but then she vanished!

227
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:22,666
She never left. I saw her here.

228
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,666
What about us? We all saw her too.

229
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,583
- She didn't leave.
- Stop.

230
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:28,541
Enough.

231
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:30,791
- Sir, I swear--
- Go home, all of you!

232
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:33,833
Get out! All of you!

233
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:35,833
Except Maryam.

234
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:37,875
Brats.

235
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:51,750
It's not her fault.
She didn't do anything.

236
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:56,291
Kiki and Eka both clearly said

237
00:22:57,041 --> 00:23:00,375
Maryam was in two places at once. How?

238
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:05,625
And the possessions stopped
the moment she arrived.

239
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,416
I didn't do anything.

240
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,750
Yeah, keep telling yourself that.

241
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:12,750
Seems like the rumors are real.

242
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:15,875
There's a demon inside you.

243
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:18,708
Is that true?

244
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,583
Don't come to work for the time being.

245
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:24,708
Don't do this, I need this job, sir.

246
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:25,833
Don't bother.

247
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:27,875
- Please...
- This is my responsibility.

248
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,666
It was my fault.

249
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:32,250
We shouldn't have gone there at maghrib.

250
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:37,041
Give me another chance.

251
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:38,791
If this happens again,

252
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:41,875
you can fire me.

253
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:49,041
Whatever.

254
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:53,750
You love to play the hero, huh?

255
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,333
It's obvious Maryam's the problem.

256
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:10,666
Maryam.

257
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:17,791
You're not at fault here.

258
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,541
I'll try to talk to Mr. Taufiq again.

259
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:27,416
But I have to admit, I saw...

260
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:29,833
Saw what?

261
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:35,041
I saw you during the incident.

262
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:39,166
Was that him?

263
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,000
Are you afraid of me too?

264
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:48,250
I'm not, and I never will be.

265
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:51,041
I will always protect you,

266
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:53,416
no matter what.

267
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,708
Let's get you home.

268
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:26,625
Where have you been?

269
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:41,041
Was there another incident?

270
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:43,708
Yes.

271
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:46,666
Some workers got possessed, except Maryam.

272
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:49,791
It's not her fault.

273
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:51,500
But Mr. Taufiq...

274
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,791
Sorry, Bagas.

275
00:25:56,250 --> 00:26:00,916
But I'm sure you're aware

276
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,833
of what Maryam's been through.

277
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:06,083
Are you still okay with it?

278
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:10,083
I don't mind.

279
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,333
I'm serious about her.

280
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:15,833
What do you mean?

281
00:26:15,916 --> 00:26:18,916
I want to take things further with Maryam.

282
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:25,333
It won't be easy.

283
00:26:25,416 --> 00:26:27,791
I know that very well.

284
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:31,375
But you don't have to worry.

285
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,333
I've promised to always protect her.

286
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,250
If you'll excuse me.

287
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:44,625
- Peace be upon you.
- And upon you peace.

288
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:58,916
SOME ARE GOOD, SOME ARE NOT.
WE FOLLOW DIFFERENT PATHS.

289
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,958
<i>Do you want to see Ifrit?</i>

290
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:05,416
If seeing him once is all it takes

291
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,791
to keep him from bothering people...

292
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:13,666
then, yes.

293
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:21,125
If you want to see the jinn,

294
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:25,583
<i>recite Surah Al-Jinn, verse 11,</i>

295
00:27:25,666 --> 00:27:27,583
<i>and repeat it.</i>

296
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:33,583
<i>But remember, your curiosity excites them.</i>

297
00:27:33,666 --> 00:27:34,833
<i>Be careful.</i>

298
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:40,041
I ALWAYS PROTECT YOU

299
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:06,625
Some of us are good,

300
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:09,291
and some are not.

301
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:19,833
We follow different paths.

302
00:29:23,541 --> 00:29:26,416
Some of us are good,

303
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:31,500
and some are not.

304
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:35,541
We follow different paths.

305
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:52,791
Maryam?

306
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:55,666
What's the matter?

307
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:08,875
Mom.

308
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:11,166
Maryam.

309
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,625
I'm tired, Mom.

310
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:21,000
I'm tired of this, Mom.

311
00:30:23,166 --> 00:30:24,708
Be patient, dear.

312
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,416
I want to have a normal life.

313
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:33,875
Maryam, Bagas told me.

314
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:37,666
And I've discussed it with Kyai Saleh.

315
00:30:38,416 --> 00:30:40,541
He considers this good news.

316
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:04,583
Are you sure about marrying me?

317
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,250
I'm scared you'll get hurt.

318
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,875
I'm serious about you, Mar.

319
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:22,250
Don't be afraid, I'm here.

320
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:27,166
Let me go get my bike.

321
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:47,000
Thank you.

322
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:48,291
See you, Mar.

323
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,000
Bagas!

324
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,250
Bagas?

325
00:34:59,458 --> 00:35:00,666
Bagas!

326
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:11,416
Bagas! Stop!

327
00:35:22,916 --> 00:35:26,291
Bagas!

328
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:27,708
Bagas!

329
00:35:31,708 --> 00:35:33,583
All praise be to Allah,

330
00:35:33,666 --> 00:35:36,458
the Most Merciful, the Most Kind.

331
00:35:36,541 --> 00:35:39,000
You alone we worship,
and You alone we ask for help.

332
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:40,750
Guide us on the straight path.

333
00:35:40,833 --> 00:35:46,625
The path of those You have blessed,
not the path of those who went astray.

334
00:35:46,708 --> 00:35:49,458
Hey! How dare you show up here?

335
00:35:49,541 --> 00:35:51,791
I just want to pray for Bagas.

336
00:35:51,875 --> 00:35:56,875
No! Get out of here! Now!
It's your fault Bagas is dead!

337
00:35:56,958 --> 00:35:59,791
I don't want to see you again!

338
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:03,541
- Seek forgiveness from Allah.
- Go away!

339
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:07,375
Let me go! Go away!

340
00:36:12,375 --> 00:36:14,458
You still want to defy me?

341
00:36:14,541 --> 00:36:18,916
I'm capable of killing humans.

342
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:25,791
A human's life and death
are in God's hands.

343
00:36:29,416 --> 00:36:32,250
- This is my fault.
- Seek forgiveness from Allah.

344
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:33,916
It's all my fault!

345
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:06,625
Maryam.

346
00:37:08,291 --> 00:37:09,375
Maryam!

347
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Maryam!

348
00:37:19,208 --> 00:37:20,458
Maryam!

349
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,250
Maryam.

350
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:35,541
Let's go home.

351
00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:36,875
I should die.

352
00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:41,375
- Don't do this!
- I'm better off dead!

353
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:43,416
No, Maryam!

354
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,583
- What else am I supposed to do?
- Maryam!

355
00:37:46,666 --> 00:37:47,916
Maryam!

356
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:56,333
Don't blame yourself.

357
00:37:56,416 --> 00:37:58,583
What can we possibly do?

358
00:37:58,666 --> 00:38:00,875
Someone died!

359
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:06,666
Bagas died because of me.

360
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:13,958
Maryam,

361
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:17,875
don't ever give up.

362
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:20,500
That's exactly what he wants.

363
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:40,000
{\an8}Humans are stronger than jinn.

364
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,125
Rizki.

365
00:38:57,916 --> 00:38:59,333
I'll be praying

366
00:39:00,708 --> 00:39:02,166
until dawn.

367
00:39:03,458 --> 00:39:04,916
Please tell the others

368
00:39:05,791 --> 00:39:08,166
not to disturb me.

369
00:39:09,375 --> 00:39:10,458
Yes, Kyai.

370
00:39:14,958 --> 00:39:17,541
As soon as Farhan gets here,

371
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:20,333
tell him to see me.

372
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:21,875
Okay, Kyai.

373
00:39:23,375 --> 00:39:25,416
God is most great.

374
00:39:28,458 --> 00:39:30,125
God is most great.

375
00:39:31,791 --> 00:39:33,750
God is most great.

376
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:37,250
God is most great.

377
00:39:39,375 --> 00:39:42,125
Peace be upon you, and the mercy of Allah.

378
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:47,958
Peace be upon you, and the mercy of Allah.

379
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,916
All praise and thanks be to Allah.

380
00:39:58,541 --> 00:40:01,333
Almighty God, I have lost, so help me.

381
00:40:01,416 --> 00:40:04,083
Heal my broken heart.

382
00:40:04,166 --> 00:40:06,541
Bring together what has fallen apart.

383
00:40:06,625 --> 00:40:09,458
Truly, You are the Most Merciful
and All-Powerful.

384
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:13,791
I am defeated by my body and desires,

385
00:40:13,875 --> 00:40:19,583
so I can't keep remembering You
or stay close to You.

386
00:40:19,666 --> 00:40:22,583
Indeed, association with jinn
is a great injustice.

387
00:40:22,666 --> 00:40:26,125
And Allah does not want any injustice
for His servants.

388
00:40:26,208 --> 00:40:29,791
So the wrongdoers were destroyed,

389
00:40:29,875 --> 00:40:33,416
all praise belongs to Allah,
the Lord of all the worlds.

390
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:45,208
There were men among humans
who seek protection from men among jinns.

391
00:40:45,291 --> 00:40:47,750
I know who you are.

392
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:50,458
What do you want?

393
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:55,666
How dare you challenge me?

394
00:41:10,291 --> 00:41:17,250
You think this is enough
to separate me from her?

395
00:41:52,458 --> 00:41:53,791
Maryam,

396
00:41:54,958 --> 00:41:56,666
did you pray?

397
00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:00,875
Maryam,

398
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:04,916
you want to worship in peace, don't you?

399
00:42:05,625 --> 00:42:09,458
All I want is to worship in peace
and live a normal life.

400
00:42:10,875 --> 00:42:14,625
God has promised

401
00:42:15,708 --> 00:42:18,500
to help His servants

402
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:24,250
who pray and persevere.

403
00:42:25,916 --> 00:42:28,041
Be strong, Maryam.

404
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:32,041
Don't give up.

405
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:42,583
Where are you going, Kyai?

406
00:42:53,791 --> 00:42:56,750
It's time for me to go.

407
00:42:59,708 --> 00:43:01,708
This is all part of God's plan.

408
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:05,541
What am I supposed to do without you?

409
00:43:06,666 --> 00:43:08,916
I am just a servant of God.

410
00:43:09,833 --> 00:43:14,375
God's the one who's been helping you,

411
00:43:15,625 --> 00:43:20,208
and God will keep helping you after this.

412
00:44:07,291 --> 00:44:10,541
God is most great.

413
00:44:10,625 --> 00:44:15,541
God is most great.

414
00:44:15,625 --> 00:44:22,125
God is most great.

415
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:33,958
There is no god except Allah.

416
00:44:55,833 --> 00:44:57,000
Be strong, Maryam.

417
00:45:07,625 --> 00:45:13,250
<i>KH.</i> RAHMAT SALEH <i>BIN KH.</i> ABDUL FAQIH
L: 02-01-1965 W: 24-02-2015

418
00:45:38,458 --> 00:45:40,000
What do you want?

419
00:45:42,166 --> 00:45:44,375
You're here for me!

420
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:56,750
Why are you still bothering others?

421
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:01,375
What do you want?

422
00:46:04,625 --> 00:46:07,208
Do you want me dead?

423
00:46:07,291 --> 00:46:12,833
- You want me dead?
- Seek forgiveness from Allah, Maryam!

424
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,458
BE WITH ME

425
00:47:28,291 --> 00:47:29,333
Dear...

426
00:47:39,208 --> 00:47:40,541
This is my fault.

427
00:47:44,541 --> 00:47:46,333
- It's my fault.
- Don't do this.

428
00:47:47,208 --> 00:47:48,250
Let me go!

429
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,458
- Let me go!
- Stop!

430
00:47:50,541 --> 00:47:52,458
Take my life instead!

431
00:47:56,166 --> 00:47:57,333
No, Mom.

432
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,208
- Forgive me.
- No, Mom!

433
00:48:00,291 --> 00:48:01,541
No.

434
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:40,500
This is all my fault, dear.

435
00:48:41,375 --> 00:48:44,583
It's all because of me.

436
00:48:47,208 --> 00:48:48,583
I'm sorry.

437
00:48:56,875 --> 00:48:58,541
I love you, Maryam.

438
00:50:40,666 --> 00:50:41,791
Maryam!

439
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:47,791
Maryam!

440
00:50:50,083 --> 00:50:56,375
Now who can separate me from this child?

441
00:50:56,458 --> 00:51:00,083
I'm the one who will face you!
You're a coward if you kill her!

442
00:51:00,166 --> 00:51:03,000
You're nothing compared to your teacher,

443
00:51:03,083 --> 00:51:04,583
and even he lost.

444
00:51:04,666 --> 00:51:06,916
I seek refuge in Allah
from the outcast Shaitan.

445
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,458
In God's name.

446
00:51:08,541 --> 00:51:11,125
If Shaitan tries to provoke you,

447
00:51:11,208 --> 00:51:13,375
then seek refuge in Allah.

448
00:51:13,458 --> 00:51:15,583
He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing.

449
00:51:15,666 --> 00:51:18,875
I ask Allah, the Almighty, to heal you.

450
00:51:18,958 --> 00:51:21,958
I ask Allah, the Almighty, to heal you.

451
00:51:22,041 --> 00:51:26,083
I ask Allah, the Almighty, to heal you.

452
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:28,625
In the name of God.

453
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:37,791
Maryam, wake up.

454
00:51:39,833 --> 00:51:40,916
Dear.

455
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:02,541
I'm Farhan.

456
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:06,666
Kyai Saleh told me about you.

457
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,291
We've met before,

458
00:52:09,916 --> 00:52:11,833
but you probably don't remember.

459
00:52:13,458 --> 00:52:14,958
We were kids then.

460
00:52:16,375 --> 00:52:18,000
Kyai shouldn't have died.

461
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:23,208
It's all my fault.

462
00:52:24,666 --> 00:52:26,125
Before he passed,

463
00:52:28,375 --> 00:52:30,583
I didn't get a chance to see him again.

464
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:32,916
But I know

465
00:52:34,208 --> 00:52:37,083
he wouldn't want you to blame yourself.

466
00:52:38,625 --> 00:52:40,125
As humans,

467
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:43,250
death isn't our burden to bear.

468
00:52:45,291 --> 00:52:47,041
It's part of God's will.

469
00:53:07,708 --> 00:53:09,125
Hang in there, dear.

470
00:53:12,916 --> 00:53:14,041
Don't give up.

471
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:15,916
I beg you.

472
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:48,083
I seek forgiveness from Allah.

473
00:53:58,791 --> 00:54:00,250
Don't bother me.

474
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:03,625
Let me pray in peace.

475
00:54:04,583 --> 00:54:06,833
I seek refuge in Allah
from the outcast Shaitan.

476
00:54:06,916 --> 00:54:08,208
In the name of God.

477
00:54:14,625 --> 00:54:16,333
God is most great.

478
00:54:28,583 --> 00:54:30,125
PEACE BE UPON YOU, FARHAN.

479
00:54:30,208 --> 00:54:32,500
PROTECT MARYAM FROM THE JINN
TRYING TO CLAIM HER.

480
00:54:32,583 --> 00:54:36,041
ONLY LOVE BORN FROM SINCERITY
CAN SHIELD HER. RAHMAT SALEH.

481
00:54:43,458 --> 00:54:44,708
Kyai, I'm sorry.

482
00:54:48,375 --> 00:54:50,291
We couldn't meet one last time.

483
00:54:50,833 --> 00:54:53,625
God willing, I'll carry on your fight.

484
00:55:02,041 --> 00:55:05,625
I seek refuge in Allah
from the outcast Shaitan.

485
00:55:07,875 --> 00:55:11,000
I dedicate this prayer to the noble

486
00:55:11,791 --> 00:55:15,666
Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him,

487
00:55:16,416 --> 00:55:21,500
and to the soul of the late
Kyai Rahmat Saleh,

488
00:55:21,583 --> 00:55:23,625
son of Kyai Abdul Faqih.

489
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:28,708
There is no god but Allah.

490
00:55:28,791 --> 00:55:34,333
There is no god but Allah.

491
00:55:34,416 --> 00:55:38,625
- There is no god but Allah.
- There is no god but Allah.

492
00:55:38,708 --> 00:55:44,041
There is no god but Allah.

493
00:55:44,125 --> 00:55:48,291
There is no god but Allah.

494
00:55:48,375 --> 00:55:50,291
Peace be upon you, Jinn.

495
00:55:51,166 --> 00:55:55,416
Whatever you do won't stop me.
She's under my control.

496
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:58,458
And you will die for nothing.

497
00:56:07,291 --> 00:56:09,500
I seek forgiveness from Allah.

498
00:57:54,208 --> 00:57:55,041
Hey.

499
00:57:55,833 --> 00:57:59,166
I heard she attempted suicide
at the beach the other day.

500
00:58:00,625 --> 00:58:02,625
Then why is she still here?

501
00:58:02,708 --> 00:58:04,583
The new <i>ustaz</i> saved her.

502
00:58:05,541 --> 00:58:06,666
Poor girl.

503
00:58:07,583 --> 00:58:09,375
But she brought it on herself.

504
00:58:12,125 --> 00:58:13,166
Kiki,

505
00:58:13,916 --> 00:58:15,083
aren't you worried

506
00:58:16,541 --> 00:58:18,333
that she's working here again?

507
00:58:18,416 --> 00:58:20,708
What if we end up like Bagas?

508
00:58:20,791 --> 00:58:23,708
- Hell no!
- I don't want that either.

509
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:25,791
Why'd you say that?

510
00:58:25,875 --> 00:58:29,000
I don't want us to get hurt.

511
00:58:29,083 --> 00:58:30,833
Let's just drop it.

512
00:58:38,166 --> 00:58:39,291
Eka!

513
00:58:47,125 --> 00:58:48,208
Mar, no!

514
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:49,583
- Maryam!
- Forgive me!

515
00:58:49,666 --> 00:58:53,041
You don't even deserve

516
00:58:53,125 --> 00:58:54,916
- to end up like Bagas.
- Stop!

517
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,166
Mar!

518
00:58:57,250 --> 00:59:00,375
What's coming for you is much worse.

519
00:59:00,458 --> 00:59:02,291
Mar, we were just joking!

520
00:59:03,625 --> 00:59:05,541
You want this too?

521
00:59:17,416 --> 00:59:19,375
No!

522
00:59:21,083 --> 00:59:21,916
Maryam!

523
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,666
Oh, my God!

524
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:27,583
Seek forgiveness from Allah, Maryam!
Stop! Wake up!

525
00:59:27,666 --> 00:59:31,625
I seek protection with Allah,
the Most Glorious,

526
00:59:31,708 --> 00:59:34,875
and with His perfect words

527
00:59:34,958 --> 00:59:41,083
from the evil that comes down from
the sky and the evil that rises up to it.

528
00:59:41,166 --> 00:59:42,250
Maryam!

529
00:59:48,041 --> 00:59:49,083
Eka!

530
01:00:34,208 --> 01:00:36,666
I got this <i>tasbih</i>
when I was studying in Egypt.

531
01:00:38,791 --> 01:00:40,333
Somehow, it reminds me of a girl

532
01:00:40,416 --> 01:00:43,375
who used to visit the boarding school

533
01:00:43,458 --> 01:00:45,416
and play with Kyai's <i>tasbih.</i>

534
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,041
Take it.

535
01:00:54,916 --> 01:00:56,208
Don't give up.

536
01:00:57,250 --> 01:00:58,958
I'm sure Kyai Saleh

537
01:00:59,041 --> 01:01:01,916
and your friend, Bagas,

538
01:01:03,875 --> 01:01:05,375
would want you to keep going.

539
01:01:06,541 --> 01:01:08,250
You're not alone.

540
01:01:08,333 --> 01:01:09,750
You have Allah.

541
01:01:15,583 --> 01:01:18,291
I'll write a <i>dua</i> for you to recite
after you pray.

542
01:02:12,583 --> 01:02:15,333
MAY GOD'S MERCY BE UPON YOU

543
01:02:17,916 --> 01:02:19,083
{\an8}I AM THE ETERNAL FLAME

544
01:02:19,166 --> 01:02:21,125
FOR THE SAKE OF GOLD, I LOVE A HUMAN, YOU

545
01:02:23,666 --> 01:02:29,333
O Allah, I ask You to protect me
from the whispers of the devils.

546
01:02:29,416 --> 01:02:32,791
And I ask You to keep them away from me.

547
01:02:32,875 --> 01:02:37,500
O Allah, I ask You to protect me
from the whispers of the devils.

548
01:02:37,583 --> 01:02:41,500
And I ask You to keep them away from me.

549
01:02:41,583 --> 01:02:43,250
EVERY NIGHT, I WRITE FOR YOU

550
01:02:45,583 --> 01:02:50,375
O Allah, I ask You to protect me
from the whispers of the devils.

551
01:02:50,458 --> 01:02:54,708
And I ask You to keep them away from me.

552
01:03:37,583 --> 01:03:40,083
{\an8}I'D NEVER RUIN YOUR HAPPINESS I LOVE YOU

553
01:04:46,541 --> 01:04:51,041
<i>Why are you ignoring me, Maryam?</i>

554
01:04:51,125 --> 01:04:55,208
<i>Soon, all the light around you
will vanish,</i>

555
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:59,208
<i>- and only I will remain...</i>
- Stop!

556
01:04:59,291 --> 01:05:04,125
- Stop. Enough!
<i>- ...at the end of your life.</i>

557
01:05:04,208 --> 01:05:08,125
<i>I love you, Maryam.</i>

558
01:05:08,208 --> 01:05:11,583
- Stop!
- Maryam!

559
01:05:11,666 --> 01:05:16,541
- Maryam! I seek forgiveness from Allah!
- Enough!

560
01:05:16,625 --> 01:05:18,208
I seek forgiveness from Allah!

561
01:05:19,208 --> 01:05:21,125
"I will always protect you."

562
01:05:23,208 --> 01:05:24,916
"Be with me."

563
01:05:31,458 --> 01:05:33,541
"May God's mercy be upon you."

564
01:05:35,916 --> 01:05:37,583
"I am the eternal flame."

565
01:05:38,208 --> 01:05:43,666
"For the sake of gold,
I've come to love one human, you."

566
01:05:50,333 --> 01:05:52,750
"Every night in sleep, I write for you."

567
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:55,583
"I'd never ruin your happiness."

568
01:05:56,333 --> 01:06:00,250
"In all languages, I love you."

569
01:06:05,833 --> 01:06:09,833
I couldn't believe it at first
when Kyai said it's an Ifrit jinn.

570
01:06:10,791 --> 01:06:14,458
Ifrit jinn have been around
since the days of Prophet Adam.

571
01:06:14,541 --> 01:06:15,833
One that helped

572
01:06:16,833 --> 01:06:22,583
move the Queen of Sheba's throne
to Prophet Sulaiman.

573
01:06:26,083 --> 01:06:28,583
Which resulted in her embracing Islam.

574
01:06:29,208 --> 01:06:32,250
This jinn is notoriously powerful
and ruthless.

575
01:06:42,125 --> 01:06:43,916
I'm scared he'll come back.

576
01:07:03,583 --> 01:07:05,666
What should I do then?

577
01:07:11,125 --> 01:07:12,250
Maryam.

578
01:07:13,958 --> 01:07:15,166
Maryam.

579
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:42,875
- Hello, Ms. Ida.
- Hello.

580
01:08:05,916 --> 01:08:07,500
What should I do, Kyai?

581
01:08:10,125 --> 01:08:12,375
Peace be upon you, Maryam!

582
01:08:13,333 --> 01:08:14,375
Mrs. Yeni!

583
01:08:36,291 --> 01:08:38,250
Peace be upon you. Maryam!

584
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:45,166
I swear, I saw a guy come in here.

585
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:48,083
I think it's the <i>ustaz.</i>
And Mrs. Yeni isn't home.

586
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:50,208
No one is in the back.

587
01:08:50,291 --> 01:08:52,583
<i>Mind your own business!</i>

588
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:33,916
<i>One of His signs is that He created
spouses for you from your kind</i>

589
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,375
<i>so that you may find peace
and comfort in them.</i>

590
01:09:38,458 --> 01:09:42,416
{\an8}<i>And He placed love</i>

591
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:46,541
{\an8}<i>and mercy between you.</i>

592
01:09:47,333 --> 01:09:50,875
<i>Truly, in this are signs</i>

593
01:09:50,958 --> 01:09:55,000
<i>for people who think.</i>

594
01:09:55,083 --> 01:09:59,750
- Take responsibility!
- Get rid of the demon!

595
01:10:01,791 --> 01:10:07,833
- Take responsibility!
- Get rid of the demon!

596
01:10:07,916 --> 01:10:10,583
- Take responsibility!
- Get rid of the demon!

597
01:10:10,666 --> 01:10:11,666
Goodness!

598
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:13,750
Just get inside.

599
01:10:13,833 --> 01:10:17,750
Everyone calm down!

600
01:10:17,833 --> 01:10:19,625
I seek forgiveness from Allah.

601
01:10:21,416 --> 01:10:25,041
How much longer
do I have to be a burden to others?

602
01:10:30,375 --> 01:10:31,708
I was at Kyai's grave

603
01:10:33,958 --> 01:10:37,833
when I heard his voice
reciting the Qur'an.

604
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:42,416
Maybe it's just me missing him,

605
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,625
but the verse was so clear.

606
01:10:55,625 --> 01:10:58,583
One of His signs is that He created

607
01:10:58,666 --> 01:11:02,708
spouses for you from your kind.

608
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,833
{\an8}Spouses from your kind?

609
01:11:09,416 --> 01:11:11,833
{\an8}Humans are meant for humans,

610
01:11:13,250 --> 01:11:14,875
{\an8}and jinn for jinn, right?

611
01:11:22,541 --> 01:11:23,750
If you're willing...

612
01:11:25,708 --> 01:11:26,958
In God's name.

613
01:11:28,958 --> 01:11:30,875
Please allow me to marry you.

614
01:11:39,166 --> 01:11:44,291
{\an8}Didn't I make it clear?

615
01:11:45,375 --> 01:11:47,916
No one can separate me from her!

616
01:11:49,250 --> 01:11:53,125
I seek refuge in Allah
from the outcast Shaitan. In God's name.

617
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:54,541
{\an8}I will not

618
01:11:56,541 --> 01:11:59,125
{\an8}let anyone marry her!

619
01:12:00,208 --> 01:12:01,708
I will marry her.

620
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:04,333
I will make sure your death will be slow

621
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:10,458
and you will feel every moment of it.

622
01:12:11,083 --> 01:12:14,416
Death is in the hands of Allah, not yours!

623
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:18,541
{\an8}I seek refuge in Allah
from the outcast Shaitan. In God's name.

624
01:12:18,625 --> 01:12:24,708
{\an8}We sent the Qur'an as healing
and mercy for those who believe.

625
01:12:24,791 --> 01:12:28,916
{\an8}But for wrongdoers,
it only makes things worse.

626
01:12:50,166 --> 01:12:52,125
I'm scared, Mom.

627
01:12:55,166 --> 01:12:57,208
I'm worried about Farhan.

628
01:13:07,875 --> 01:13:08,916
Dear,

629
01:13:10,708 --> 01:13:13,000
death is in the hands of God.

630
01:13:15,625 --> 01:13:16,875
You're strong.

631
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:21,791
You've endured for so long.

632
01:13:38,375 --> 01:13:40,250
You deserve to be loved.

633
01:13:46,375 --> 01:13:48,541
Farhan knows the danger,

634
01:13:51,041 --> 01:13:53,375
but he's still here.

635
01:14:03,083 --> 01:14:05,208
If Kyai Saleh were still alive,

636
01:14:07,375 --> 01:14:10,166
he would've gladly
been your marriage guardian.

637
01:14:30,791 --> 01:14:34,083
If you're marrying me out of pity,

638
01:14:34,166 --> 01:14:36,166
- then--
- It's not out of pity.

639
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:41,833
It's your choice. I won't force you.

640
01:14:45,625 --> 01:14:48,916
Allah will always make a way,
even if it's not the one we expect.

641
01:14:49,583 --> 01:14:50,708
I believe this.

642
01:14:51,666 --> 01:14:52,750
By God's will,

643
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:56,541
I will love you for Allah.

644
01:15:02,958 --> 01:15:04,416
<i>Maryam.</i>

645
01:15:05,958 --> 01:15:07,416
<i>Maryam.</i>

646
01:15:09,041 --> 01:15:10,333
<i>Maryam.</i>

647
01:15:12,166 --> 01:15:13,875
<i>Maryam.</i>

648
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:21,083
<i>His love isn't real,</i>

649
01:15:21,166 --> 01:15:26,625
<i>he's only using you
to test his own strength.</i>

650
01:15:26,708 --> 01:15:32,375
<i>No one loves you like I do,</i>

651
01:15:32,458 --> 01:15:35,750
<i>with a sincere heart, for eternity.</i>

652
01:15:49,083 --> 01:15:51,458
I seek forgiveness from Allah.

653
01:15:51,541 --> 01:15:53,333
I seek forgiveness from Allah.

654
01:16:22,208 --> 01:16:23,208
Stop this!

655
01:16:25,708 --> 01:16:27,291
Stop messing with my life!

656
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:42,333
I LOVE YOU MORE THAN ANYONE EVER WILL

657
01:16:49,958 --> 01:16:51,583
I will marry him.

658
01:16:52,291 --> 01:16:54,250
I will marry him!

659
01:16:59,583 --> 01:17:03,041
Allah, I ask You to protect me
from the whispers of the devils.

660
01:17:03,125 --> 01:17:05,875
And I ask You to keep them away from me.

661
01:17:06,791 --> 01:17:10,083
Allah, I ask You to protect me
from the whispers of the devils.

662
01:17:10,166 --> 01:17:12,916
And I ask You to keep them away from me.

663
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:14,625
Maryam.

664
01:17:22,791 --> 01:17:24,333
I'm going to marry Farhan.

665
01:17:25,125 --> 01:17:26,250
I want peace.

666
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:28,958
I just want a peaceful life.

667
01:17:29,625 --> 01:17:32,583
<i>Kyai said marriage
is the longest act of worship.</i>

668
01:17:33,375 --> 01:17:35,458
He would be proud of you.

669
01:17:36,250 --> 01:17:39,041
All part of God's plan.
We're just His servants.

670
01:17:39,625 --> 01:17:43,625
We'll do <i>Hajat</i> prayer through the night,
and after <i>Fajr,</i> we'll do the <i>ijab qabul.</i>

671
01:18:10,916 --> 01:18:12,291
<i>Maryam.</i>

672
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,916
- Peace be upon you.
- And upon you peace.

673
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,208
Is everything ready?

674
01:18:26,291 --> 01:18:27,625
- Yes.
- Thank God.

675
01:18:27,708 --> 01:18:28,708
Let's do this.

676
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:07,833
Ready?

677
01:19:07,916 --> 01:19:09,083
Farhan!

678
01:19:10,083 --> 01:19:11,083
Pardon me.

679
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:15,916
Maryam is missing.

680
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,458
- Oh, my God.
- She's not in the <i>wudhu</i> room.

681
01:19:23,708 --> 01:19:24,916
Pardon me,

682
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,041
but do you give your blessing
for me to marry Maryam now?

683
01:19:28,125 --> 01:19:29,166
I do.

684
01:19:30,583 --> 01:19:31,625
But she's not here.

685
01:19:31,708 --> 01:19:35,333
By God's will, I can marry her
no matter where she is.

686
01:19:35,416 --> 01:19:37,916
My vow to God reaches the heavens.

687
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,041
It's a vow that can't be broken.

688
01:19:44,291 --> 01:19:45,708
We'll start the <i>aked.</i>

689
01:21:56,791 --> 01:22:00,250
<i>God, with Your permission
I make her my wife,</i>

690
01:22:00,333 --> 01:22:03,583
<i>and by Your words
her honor is lawful to me.</i>

691
01:22:03,666 --> 01:22:05,625
<i>If You allow us to have children,</i>

692
01:22:05,708 --> 01:22:07,791
make them a source of blessing and honor.

693
01:22:07,875 --> 01:22:12,166
<i>Don't let Shaitan take any part of it.</i>

694
01:22:13,125 --> 01:22:15,041
Praise be to God.

695
01:22:36,041 --> 01:22:37,541
Mr. Muhammad Farhan

696
01:22:37,625 --> 01:22:39,291
son of the late Ammarudin,

697
01:22:39,375 --> 01:22:41,708

701
01:22:59,875 --> 01:23:01,541
I seek forgiveness from God.

702

In the name of God.

Goodness!

717
01:24:16,250 --> 01:24:17,416
Sir!

718
01:24:52,916 --> 01:24:54,916
How could you reject me?

719
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,916
I've always been by your side.

720
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:02,750
No human has been
as loyal to you as I have, Maryam.

721
01:25:02,833 --> 01:25:04,375
Go away!

722
01:25:04,458 --> 01:25:06,958
Leave me alone!

723
01:25:07,041 --> 01:25:13,208
Don't you remember?
You've been here before.

724
01:25:13,291 --> 01:25:16,250
Don't compare yourself
to the people in my life!

725
01:25:16,333 --> 01:25:21,541
They love and accept me for who I am!

726
01:25:21,625 --> 01:25:24,000
I'll always choose them over you!

727
01:25:28,333 --> 01:25:33,916
I accept marrying Siti Maryam,
daughter of the late Farid Zaynun

728
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,208
with the dowry agreed upon.

729
01:25:36,291 --> 01:25:38,416
Witnesses, is it lawful?

730
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:41,291
- Yes!
- Praise be to God.

731
01:25:41,375 --> 01:25:46,416
May God bless you
and unite you both in goodness.

732
01:25:50,833 --> 01:25:53,458
You can never get away from me.

733
01:25:54,166 --> 01:25:56,625
Dear Allah,

734
01:25:57,666 --> 01:26:01,083
<i>You have power and I don't.</i>

735
01:26:01,166 --> 01:26:03,083
<i>You know what I don't.</i>

736
01:26:03,166 --> 01:26:06,083
You know the unseen.

737
01:26:06,166 --> 01:26:10,250
<i>So if You see that Farhan</i>

738
01:26:10,333 --> 01:26:13,958
<i>is good for my religion and my afterlife,</i>

739
01:26:14,041 --> 01:26:15,916
then make it happen for me.

740
01:26:16,708 --> 01:26:20,875
Dear Allah,

741
01:26:20,958 --> 01:26:23,541
You have power

742
01:26:23,625 --> 01:26:25,666
and I don't.

743
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:27,708
You know what I don't.

744
01:26:27,791 --> 01:26:31,083
You know the unseen.

745
01:26:31,166 --> 01:26:36,166
So if You see that Farhan

746
01:26:36,250 --> 01:26:41,208
is good for my religion and my afterlife,

747
01:26:41,291 --> 01:26:43,375
then make it happen for me.

748
01:27:13,875 --> 01:27:15,000
Maryam!

749
01:27:16,750 --> 01:27:17,833
Maryam!

750
01:27:26,333 --> 01:27:27,875
Thank God.

751
01:27:27,958 --> 01:27:29,041
Maryam?

752
01:27:59,083 --> 01:28:02,250
He follows me everywhere I go.

753
01:28:03,583 --> 01:28:07,083
Watches everything I do.

754
01:28:09,083 --> 01:28:12,375
And I know...

755
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,083
he's here.

756
01:28:53,541 --> 01:28:56,125
If God wills.

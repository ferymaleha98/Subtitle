00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:50,583
<i>O sacred deities above,</i>

5
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:55,416
<i>please keep this child and me
safely out of harm's way.</i>

6
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:57,833
I have prayed and worshipped
the goddess my whole life.

7
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:00,208
And this?

8
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:02,958
This is what I get?!

9
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:21,375
You're insane!

10
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:24,500
You defied the goddess.

11
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:27,000
- You must die for this!
- It's not a baby?

12
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,625
Wench!

13
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:33,000
You wench!

14
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,458
Put out the fire!

15
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:37,750
Hurry up!

16
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,458
Damn you, you wicked witch!

17
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:43,041
Hey!

18
00:02:57,416 --> 00:03:00,458
I will have my revenge on you all!

{\an8}DAN MAKHAM TIA DISTRICT,
KANCHANABURI PROVINCE

21
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:36,375
- Hey, what's wrong?
- Yak! Yos was pulling my tooth out!

22
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:37,875
Because it's loose!

23
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,000
You're such a crybaby.

24
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,000
It's scary.

25
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,041
There, there.

26
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,958
Here. It's done.

27
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:50,375
That was your last baby tooth?

28
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,125
You're a young lady now.

29
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,416
Ready for a boyfriend?

30
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,875
Or got one already?

31
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,458
Like I would tell you!

32
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:03,458
Remember to toss it on the roof
so her new tooth grows well.

33
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:04,625
Go on.

34
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:05,708
Your sister's here.

35
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:08,083
- Hey!
- Come here.

36
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,875
- Let me give you a kiss.
- I've missed you!

37
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,500
- Come.
- Hi, little one.

38
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,375
There's my angel.

39
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,750
That husband of yours.

40
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:19,708
You're big!

41
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:23,416
He should be taking care of you,
not sending you home.

42
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,833
Hi, Dad.

43
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:28,458
Nagging again, I see.

44
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:33,500
Well, it's sugar season.

45
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:36,541
Pradit is busy
getting his cane to the mill.

46
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,416
Good thing he's busy.

47
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,958
We get to have Yad here with us
a bit longer.

48
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,916
- Right.
- See?

49
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,458
Yak!

50
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:08,791
The table is ready!

51
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:09,750
Coming.

52
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,166
Come on.

53
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,916
Here, Yad.

54
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:17,208
Your favorite duck stew from Lee's.

55
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,333
Make sure you eat plenty for the baby.

56
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,125
Thanks.

57
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,333
Hey, that's for Yad.

58
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,291
- Put it down. It's for Yad.
- Right.

59
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,583
When are you due?

60
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,500
The doctor said in two months.

61
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:39,958
That means I'll be an aunt soon.

62
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:43,958
- I'll be Aunt Yee.
- Aunt Yee?

63
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:48,166
So, are you hoping for a boy or a girl?

64
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,666
I think a boy would be good.

65
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,708
He could help out on the farm.

66
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,333
No, forget him.

67
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:55,541
Better a girl.

68
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,375
Your brothers are wild enough as it is.

69
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,291
Well, let's just hope for twins.

70
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,625
Make the pain worth it, right?

71
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:05,458
One of each.

72
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,041
Makes everyone happy.

73
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,541
That would be nice!

74
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:09,541
You up for that?

75
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:10,916
I guess I'll pass.

76
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:14,833
Hey, all our names start with Y.

77
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:19,333
So, if the baby is a girl,

78
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:20,583
why not Yerm?

79
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:24,041
For a boy, I'm thinking

80
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:24,958
Yud.

81
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,250
- That's awful.
- How is that?

82
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,875
Seriously? Yud?

83
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:29,916
What?

84
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,916
That's terrible.

85
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:32,875
Come on.

86
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:35,833
Yak, are you thinking of
rejoining the army?

87
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm not sure.

88
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:50,708
Well, I heard they're recruiting again.

89
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,875
Maybe it's time to re-enlist.

90
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:03,041
Yod and I can look after the farm.

91
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,250
Just leave it to us.

92
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:08,750
Yeah.

93
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:13,375
If Yak goes back,
who'll pick me up from school?

94
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,958
I do that every single day.

95
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,208
No, I don't want you to.

96
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,083
You keep hitting on my teacher.

97
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,541
- It's embarrassing.
- What?

98
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,625
- You do that?
- Huh? That's not true!

99
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:27,208
No wonder Yee's always late for dinner.

100
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,375
I was just talking with her teacher.

101
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,625
Stop making excuses.

102
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,750
- I can't believe you.
- What's her name?

103
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,083
Miss Prakaisri.

104
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:50,375
Here. A gift for your child.

105
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,750
Thanks, Mom.

106
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,875
- You're done?
- Yes.

107
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,666
Mom's still keeping everything in order.

108
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,083
Yee can sleep on her own now.

109
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,833
She doesn't need Mom anymore.

110
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,583
Yam must be happy

111
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,875
to see all of us together again.

112
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,041
Actually...

113
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,416
I'd like to return to the army.

114
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,000
I just worry about home.

115
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,750
Why? Don't think I can manage?

116
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:15,083
Hey, I'm not doubting you.

117
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,500
You're handling things very well.

118
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:22,000
I just want to make up for lost time.

119
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:26,916
You've done enough for us.

120
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,416
It's time to do something for yourself.

121
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,500
Private Yak, reporting for duty, sir!

122
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:48,333
<i>The Royal Thai Army protects you</i>

123
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,375
<i>Digging moats, feeding fish too</i>

124
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:54,041
- <i>Some stealing from the forces</i>
- Walk straight!

125
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,833
- <i>Always getting drunk, of course!</i>
- I'll join you.

126
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,875
I knew it! Move!

127
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,833
Stop!

128
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:05,916
Bro!

129
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,250
The house is a mess!

130
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,916
Stop!

131
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,333
Get back here.

132
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,208
I'm leaving, Yee.

133
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:22,833
Ped.

134
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:24,416
Bye-bye.

135
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,166
Boo!

136
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,916
You scared me!

137
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,875
I just wanted to ask

138
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,541
if you wanted to go home together.

139
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,208
I'm waiting for my brothers.

140
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:36,625
All right then. I'll see you around.

141
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:37,708
Yeah.

142
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,625
Aren't you leaving?

143
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,083
No!

144
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,458
Yak, help!

145
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:29,041
Yak, help!

146
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,000
Yak!

147
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:43,583
Yee!

148
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,625
Yee!

149
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:48,833
Yee!

150
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:51,041
Yak, help me!

151
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,375
Darn it! Yee!

152
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,333
Yak, help me!

153
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,541
Yee!

154
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,208
- Yak!
- Yee.

155
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:06,750
- Help!
- Yee.

156
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,416
Yee!

157
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:10,833
Yee!

158
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:13,333
Yee!

159
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,541
Let her go.

160
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,208
I said, let her go.

161
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:42,875
- I'm here.
- Yak!

162
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,458
Hey, are you all right?

163
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,208
Yee!

164
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,541
Yee!

165
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:57,708
Yak!

166
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,208
Listen to my voice, Yee.

167
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:08,833
Yee!

168
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,125
Come back, Yee.

169
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,791
Stop, Yee!

170
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:15,708
Don't!

171
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,666
Yee.

172
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,791
It's me, Yee. Come back to me.

173
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:20,750
Yee!

174
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,291
Yee!

175
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,625
Yak, watch out!

176
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,791
What the hell is happening here?

177
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,125
Leave my sister alone.

178
00:17:58,875 --> 00:17:59,916
Sarge,

179
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,000
how is that hell-spawn back here?

180
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,666
There's probably more than one of them.

181
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,000
Yak!

182
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:15,708
Yak.

183
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:19,458
- Please, you have to help Yee.
- Mom, it's okay.

184
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:22,583
Yak, please find a way to save her.

185
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,083
Sarge.

186
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,291
Any ideas?

187
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,625
Anything to help us find Yee!

188
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,666
Sarge?

189
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,333
I know a way.

190
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:53,333
There are three rules
for using a spirit board.

191
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,041
First,

192
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,833
only think about Yam.

193
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,666
Don't lose your focus.

194
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:02,583
Second, always keep
your finger on the glass.

195
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,166
Last,

196
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,375
don't ever let the glass break.

197
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,833
Yam.

198
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:17,625
{\an8}Please save Yee.

199
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,750
Do you think she'll come?

200
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,000
If she knows Yee is in danger,

201
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,083
no matter where she is,

202
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,708
Yam will come back.

203
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:47,500
Let's begin.

204
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:58,625
<i>Bud...</i>

205
00:19:58,708 --> 00:19:59,750
<i>Dho...</i>

206
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:00,666
<i>Dha...</i>

207
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,166
<i>Ya.</i>

208
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,208
<i>Bud...</i>

209
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,250
<i>Dho...</i>

210
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,416
<i>Dha...</i>

211
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,333
<i>Ya.</i>

212
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:07,750
<i>Bud...</i>

213
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:08,666
<i>Dho...</i>

214
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,583
<i>Dha...</i>

215
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:10,500
<i>Ya.</i>

216
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,958
We call Yam's spirit

217
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,458
to enter this glass.

218
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,041
Are you here, Yam?

219
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,625
YES

220
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,625
Is Yee safe?

221
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:23,458
NO

222
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:28,625
YES

223
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,125
Where

224
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,000
did they take her?

225
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:43,958
O

226
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:46,291
N

227
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,875
S

228
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,333
N

229
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:57,291
B

230
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,041
I

231
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:06,833
"Bongsanodbiang"?

232
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:10,458
Sarge?

233
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:12,958
Are we sure it's Yam?

234
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,625
Don't lose your focus!

235
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,291
Don't let go.

236
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:05,791
Sarge!

237
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:08,875
D

238
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:09,833
I

239
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:11,083
E

240
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,666
We've found their tracks
leading into the cave.

241
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,166
- Kill all those captives!
- Yes, sir!

242
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:27,416
Who did this?

243
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,125
It's exactly like the rumor.

244
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:40,625
This one is alive.

245
00:24:45,666 --> 00:24:47,083
What happened here?

246
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,833
If you wish to save your sister,

247
00:25:15,916 --> 00:25:17,958
follow me.

248
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,541
- Yak?
- Yak!

249
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:47,833
- Yak!
- Yak. Yak!

250
00:25:47,916 --> 00:25:49,250
What's happening?

251
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:51,916
- Yak!
- Yak!

252
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:54,666
- Talk to me.
- Listen to me.

253
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,250
- Yak!
- Yak.

254
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,208
- Yak!
- Yak.

255
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:04,000
- Lift him up.
- Yak!

256
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:05,166
Yak!

257
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:13,416
Yak?

258
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,833
Do you hear me?

259
00:26:15,916 --> 00:26:17,833
Listen to my voice, Yak.

260
00:26:17,916 --> 00:26:21,708
- Yak.
- Come on, Yak.

261
00:26:21,791 --> 00:26:22,833
Yak!

262
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:26,416
- Can you hear me?
- Yak?

263
00:26:35,666 --> 00:26:37,666
Yak, I'm coming too.

264
00:26:40,416 --> 00:26:41,333
Dad,

265
00:26:42,791 --> 00:26:44,708
you take care of everyone here.

266
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:48,333
Sarge and I will manage.

267
00:27:09,666 --> 00:27:11,416
TENASSERIM RANGE
KANCHANABURI PROVINCE

268
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,000
<i>What's "Bongsanodbiang," Sarge?</i>

269
00:27:15,708 --> 00:27:18,958
<i>"Bongsanodbiang" is said to be
where spirits converge.</i>

270
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:22,416
<i>That place is crawling with the dead.</i>

271
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,083
<i>Nobody dares to step into that forest.</i>

272
00:27:25,166 --> 00:27:28,500
The authorities have tried
sending troops there,

273
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:33,958
but all attempts
ended in insanity or death.

274
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:39,083
They say the captives taken
by the Japanese to build the railroad

275
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:42,375
fled to a nearby cave,

276
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,375
but were caught.

277
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:47,166
They were all executed there.

278
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:56,791
Take it easy.

279
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,916
Here.

280
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,250
Our ride ends here.

281
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:15,875
From here, it's on foot across the river.

282
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,083
What the...?

283
00:29:28,208 --> 00:29:29,250
Yos?

284
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:34,500
You too, Yod?

285
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:36,041
Hi.

286
00:29:36,125 --> 00:29:38,000
So if you guys are here,

287
00:29:38,083 --> 00:29:40,583
who's taking care of the family, huh?

288
00:29:45,458 --> 00:29:47,125
Dad sent us

289
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:48,750
to help you.

290
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:50,416
Come on.

291
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,916
Two heads are better than one.

292
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,458
We've got four, so we're definitely safe.

293
00:30:03,583 --> 00:30:05,375
She's my sister too.

294
00:30:05,458 --> 00:30:06,625
Exactly.

295
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:07,875
Ours.

296
00:30:30,541 --> 00:30:31,958
Don't ever wander off.

297
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:33,708
Fine.

298
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,791
I know that already.

299
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:17,250
Hey! Guys! Sarge!

300
00:32:17,333 --> 00:32:18,416
A ghost!

301
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,416
It's down here!

302
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,250
Something's under the water!

303
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:45,166
Let's go.

304
00:33:27,541 --> 00:33:28,375
Yod?

305
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:31,375
Watch out, everyone.

306
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:46,208
Sarge!

307
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:48,791
Yos!

308
00:33:51,166 --> 00:33:52,166
Yod!

309
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,083
Sarge!

310
00:36:18,166 --> 00:36:21,750
See? I told you
there was a ghost down there.

311
00:36:21,833 --> 00:36:23,416
None of you listened!

312
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,916
Sarge, what now?

313
00:36:26,166 --> 00:36:29,166
Bongsanodbiang is somewhere around here.

314
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:31,791
But I don't know where.

315
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:35,250
We should ask around. Someone will know.

316
00:36:39,375 --> 00:36:40,833
There's no one here.

317
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:20,750
Yee!

318
00:39:24,458 --> 00:39:25,375
Yee!

319
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:39,166
- Yak!
- It's okay, Yee.

320
00:39:40,583 --> 00:39:42,125
Poor you.

321
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:44,458
I'm scared.

322
00:39:45,541 --> 00:39:47,916
It's okay. I'm here now.

323
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,958
I'm right here.

324
00:39:51,041 --> 00:39:52,291
Don't worry.

325
00:39:53,708 --> 00:39:55,083
Don't worry.

326
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:01,375
Yak, you're hurting me.

327
00:40:02,291 --> 00:40:03,958
It's okay, Yee.

328
00:40:04,583 --> 00:40:05,750
Yak?

329
00:40:07,125 --> 00:40:08,666
Yak, it hurts.

330
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:11,208
Yak!

331
00:40:13,125 --> 00:40:14,541
You're hurting me!

332
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:22,000
Yee.

333
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:29,708
You're not Yak.

334
00:40:29,791 --> 00:40:30,958
I am him!

335
00:40:32,708 --> 00:40:34,541
Don't you remember me?

336
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,541
A village?

337
00:43:07,625 --> 00:43:08,708
Feels like a graveyard.

338
00:43:08,791 --> 00:43:10,166
No one's around.

339
00:43:18,458 --> 00:43:19,333
Excuse me.

340
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:22,291
It's okay.

341
00:43:29,166 --> 00:43:30,541
Bongsanodbiang?

342
00:43:31,833 --> 00:43:33,791
Hey. Hey!

343
00:43:37,458 --> 00:43:38,416
Who are you?

344
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,333
Why do you want to go there?

345
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:45,958
We're looking for someone.

346
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,708
Can you show us the way?

347
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:53,833
Get rid of them.

348
00:43:58,916 --> 00:43:59,875
Follow me.

349
00:44:10,291 --> 00:44:11,708
I'm Yakhin.

350
00:44:12,541 --> 00:44:14,416
That's my friend, Kongmu.

351
00:44:16,708 --> 00:44:17,833
I'm Yak.

352
00:44:19,166 --> 00:44:22,583
These two are Yos and Yod, my brothers.

353
00:44:22,666 --> 00:44:24,583
And that's Sergeant Paphan.

354
00:44:27,125 --> 00:44:29,625
Bongsanodbiang is a forest of lost souls.

355
00:44:30,375 --> 00:44:33,041
Even seasoned hunters
never make it back alive.

356
00:44:33,666 --> 00:44:35,041
All of you

357
00:44:35,708 --> 00:44:37,666
are heading straight to your graves.

358
00:44:38,166 --> 00:44:39,500
But we have to go.

359
00:44:39,583 --> 00:44:42,208
To get our sister back.

360
00:44:43,291 --> 00:44:45,000
She's probably dead.

361
00:44:45,791 --> 00:44:47,208
Just go back.

362
00:44:47,291 --> 00:44:49,750
- What the heck?
- She's alive!

363
00:44:50,833 --> 00:44:52,375
My sister

364
00:44:53,208 --> 00:44:54,458
is alive.

365
00:45:03,583 --> 00:45:06,500
Why is this place so deserted anyway?

366
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:11,250
Eighty years ago,

367
00:45:12,416 --> 00:45:14,791
an evil spirit attacked our village.

368
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:19,583
All the young women were killed.

369
00:45:20,416 --> 00:45:21,583
SUBDUING RITUAL
1896

370
00:45:21,666 --> 00:45:25,875
<i>A pilgrim monk named Sayador
sealed that evil spirit in a coffin.</i>

371
00:45:27,083 --> 00:45:32,625
<i>He forbade anyone from entering
the haunted forest after that.</i>

372
00:45:41,166 --> 00:45:42,458
That's a relief.

373
00:45:43,125 --> 00:45:44,666
So the haunting ended.

374
00:45:46,916 --> 00:45:49,125
That was just the beginning.

375
00:45:55,291 --> 00:45:56,708
THE PACIFIC WAR, 1942

376
00:45:56,791 --> 00:45:58,875
<i>It all happened during the war.</i>

377
00:45:59,708 --> 00:46:01,916
<i>Japanese soldiers raided our village.</i>

378
00:46:02,458 --> 00:46:07,125
<i>They looted the food and forced
residents to build the railroad.</i>

379
00:46:08,041 --> 00:46:12,250
<i>All who resisted or tried to escape
were killed.</i>

380
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:24,583
We have to do this.

381
00:46:24,666 --> 00:46:26,166
But it's forbidden!

382
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,041
We're already living in hell.

383
00:46:28,125 --> 00:46:30,250
Nothing can get any worse.

384
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:34,125
<i>Fueled by resentment
toward the Japanese soldiers,</i>

385
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:37,458
<i>Mawae, the village shaman,</i>

386
00:46:37,541 --> 00:46:42,791
<i>broke Sayador's rule
and unleashed the evil spirit</i>

387
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,041
<i>to make the Japanese soldiers suffer.</i>

388
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:30,416
Keep chanting!

389
00:47:40,333 --> 00:47:42,500
Run, Mom. Run!

390
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,416
Mom!

391
00:48:26,541 --> 00:48:28,916
<i>The spirit was released,</i>

392
00:48:29,666 --> 00:48:32,166
<i>but no one could control it.</i>

393
00:48:33,458 --> 00:48:36,083
<i>And with it came death.</i>

394
00:48:43,541 --> 00:48:45,500
<i>It slaughtered everyone.</i>

395
00:48:47,333 --> 00:48:49,250
<i>No one survived...</i>

396
00:48:54,958 --> 00:48:59,500
<i>except Mawae, who was left
in a living nightmare.</i>

397
00:49:00,625 --> 00:49:04,791
Everyone calls that evil spirit "Dà Yòu."

398
00:49:05,416 --> 00:49:08,125
It whispers a deathly chant
wherever it goes.

399
00:49:09,333 --> 00:49:10,500
A chant?

400
00:49:10,583 --> 00:49:14,708
The living use it to raise the dead,

401
00:49:15,875 --> 00:49:17,416
while the dead use it

402
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,958
to put the living into a trance.

403
00:49:25,416 --> 00:49:26,583
That must be it.

404
00:49:29,083 --> 00:49:30,708
There's no hope for you.

405
00:49:33,708 --> 00:49:37,791
You fucked with the wrong family,
you goddamn ghost.

406
00:49:51,958 --> 00:49:54,000
My sister is in danger.

407
00:49:56,083 --> 00:49:57,791
Even if we have to go through hell,

408
00:49:58,666 --> 00:50:01,166
we will get her back.

409
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:03,833
You can rest here.

410
00:50:05,666 --> 00:50:07,000
That won't be necessary.

411
00:50:08,125 --> 00:50:09,500
Just tell us the way.

412
00:50:09,583 --> 00:50:11,708
It's a deadly forest,

413
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,041
shrouded in mystery.

414
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:16,875
Go in at night,

415
00:50:17,708 --> 00:50:21,500
and you'll be hunted down by spirits
before you know it.

416
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:24,958
When dawn breaks,

417
00:50:25,708 --> 00:50:28,000
Kongmu and I will take you there.

418
00:50:37,458 --> 00:50:39,666
We should trust the locals, you know.

419
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:41,541
Yos, Yod, get some rest.

420
00:50:41,625 --> 00:50:43,250
We depart at first light.

421
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,916
You should rest too.

422
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:10,333
Yak!

423
00:51:12,083 --> 00:51:13,375
Yak!

424
00:51:16,791 --> 00:51:18,125
Yak!

425
00:51:34,708 --> 00:51:35,666
Yak!

426
00:51:59,666 --> 00:52:00,500
Yak!

427
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:04,166
Yak!

428
00:52:23,375 --> 00:52:24,500
Who are you?

429
00:52:28,541 --> 00:52:30,625
Who the fuck are you?

430
00:52:38,791 --> 00:52:40,416
Where's my sister?

431
00:52:40,958 --> 00:52:42,000
Tell me!

432
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:59,000
- Yak!
- Yak!

433
00:54:00,875 --> 00:54:02,000
Yak!

434
00:54:02,708 --> 00:54:04,166
- Yak!
- Yak!

435
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:05,750
Yak!

436
00:54:09,208 --> 00:54:10,333
Yak!

437
00:54:13,916 --> 00:54:15,291
Yak!

438
00:54:15,375 --> 00:54:16,666
Hey!

439
00:54:21,916 --> 00:54:25,166
- Yak!
- Sarge, what do we do?

440
00:54:27,666 --> 00:54:28,916
- Yak!
- Yak!

441
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:37,041
- Yak!
- Yak!

442
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:40,625
- What? Yak?
- Yak?

443
00:54:40,708 --> 00:54:42,208
Yak!

444
00:54:42,291 --> 00:54:43,416
Yak!

445
00:54:45,541 --> 00:54:47,125
What happened?

446
00:54:47,208 --> 00:54:48,416
Yak.

447
00:54:50,166 --> 00:54:51,333
Yak.

448
00:54:57,583 --> 00:54:59,250
How did you find me?

449
00:54:59,875 --> 00:55:02,375
Yakhin. She told us to save you.

450
00:56:26,458 --> 00:56:29,000
Is it going to be a girl or a boy?

451
00:56:50,958 --> 00:56:52,458
Mm, so sweet.

452
00:56:53,083 --> 00:56:54,791
It must be a boy.

453
00:57:00,541 --> 00:57:01,666
Can I have him?

454
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:11,416
Do you have the guts to pull the trigger?

455
00:57:12,166 --> 00:57:14,833
I'm Yee, not Yam.

456
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:18,916
You're not my sister.

457
00:58:08,708 --> 00:58:11,625
After Puang fled to Dong Khomot,

458
00:58:12,583 --> 00:58:14,875
that evil spirit settled here

459
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:17,125
before wandering elsewhere.

460
00:58:17,958 --> 00:58:20,583
Mawae must have become its host,

461
00:58:21,666 --> 00:58:23,041
just like Chuay and Puang.

462
00:58:26,333 --> 00:58:27,583
Mawae has guts,

463
00:58:28,333 --> 00:58:30,541
resurrecting that hell-spawn for revenge.

464
00:58:33,333 --> 00:58:36,166
It must have been her only option.

465
00:58:36,958 --> 00:58:41,125
They say Dà Yòu loathes soldiers.

466
00:58:42,916 --> 00:58:45,416
No wonder it beat the hell out of Yak.

467
00:58:48,541 --> 00:58:50,208
We're here.

468
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:02,958
Holly spirits, please guide us to Yee.

469
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:06,291
This is a forbidden forest.

470
00:59:06,375 --> 00:59:10,666
Your talismans and spells
won't work in there.

471
00:59:11,875 --> 00:59:13,291
Those are sacred bells.

472
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:16,500
They help ward off evil spirits.

473
00:59:17,083 --> 00:59:19,458
They chime when danger draws close.

474
00:59:19,541 --> 00:59:22,041
You should take one each.

475
00:59:38,458 --> 00:59:40,125
Are you sure they work?

476
00:59:41,458 --> 00:59:43,833
Only if you believe.

477
00:59:48,708 --> 00:59:50,791
Don't both of you need them too?

478
00:59:56,875 --> 01:00:00,166
We locals don't need one.

479
01:00:59,125 --> 01:01:00,416
Yod!

480
01:01:06,083 --> 01:01:07,416
I saw Yee!

481
01:01:14,875 --> 01:01:16,250
Hold on!

482
01:01:16,333 --> 01:01:17,375
Where's Yod?

483
01:01:17,458 --> 01:01:18,500
Yod!

484
01:01:23,958 --> 01:01:25,166
Yod!

485
01:01:28,875 --> 01:01:30,166
Yod!

486
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Yod!

487
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:35,750
Yak?

488
01:01:40,625 --> 01:01:41,708
Yod!

489
01:01:41,791 --> 01:01:42,791
- Yod.
- Yak?

490
01:01:42,875 --> 01:01:44,000
Sarge?

491
01:01:45,916 --> 01:01:47,208
Yod!

492
01:01:47,291 --> 01:01:48,208
Yod!

493
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:29,458
Shit!

494
01:02:35,125 --> 01:02:36,291
Shit!

495
01:02:40,666 --> 01:02:41,875
Yod!

496
01:02:47,208 --> 01:02:48,166
Yod!

497
01:02:50,625 --> 01:02:51,791
Yod!

498
01:02:51,875 --> 01:02:53,250
He must be near.

499
01:02:55,583 --> 01:02:57,000
- Yod!
- Yod!

500
01:02:57,083 --> 01:02:58,541
- Yod!
- Yod!

501
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:00,875
Yod!

502
01:03:00,958 --> 01:03:01,958
Quiet!

503
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:24,375
What was that?

504
01:03:24,458 --> 01:03:25,875
Must be Pong Kang.

505
01:03:27,541 --> 01:03:29,333
What? Never heard of them.

506
01:03:30,083 --> 01:03:31,958
They're forest spirits.

507
01:03:32,666 --> 01:03:34,416
Like leaf monkeys, but way bigger.

508
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:38,750
They hunt in packs
and feed on the blood of their prey.

509
01:03:39,416 --> 01:03:41,250
They can feed on my bullets.

510
01:03:41,333 --> 01:03:42,333
Come on!

511
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:44,541
Sarge.

512
01:03:45,375 --> 01:03:47,000
Remember Khao Kwang?

513
01:03:58,375 --> 01:03:59,625
Get down!

514
01:04:23,666 --> 01:04:26,458
The enchanted bullets don't work, Sarge.

515
01:04:27,583 --> 01:04:29,166
They're afraid of fire.

516
01:04:30,625 --> 01:04:31,666
Yos, watch out!

517
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:39,958
Come on.

518
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:07,250
Let me borrow this.

519
01:05:24,166 --> 01:05:25,166
Here.

520
01:05:51,125 --> 01:05:52,958
Swoop at me all you want.

521
01:05:54,375 --> 01:05:55,291
Come on.

522
01:05:58,833 --> 01:05:59,833
Come on!

523
01:06:23,916 --> 01:06:24,916
How's your hand?

524
01:06:26,375 --> 01:06:27,541
Hurts like hell.

525
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:54,166
We already told you,

526
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:56,750
your weapons won't work in here!

527
01:06:57,458 --> 01:06:59,708
You're pissing off spirits.

528
01:06:59,791 --> 01:07:01,125
Drop your gun.

529
01:07:03,333 --> 01:07:05,458
I'd rather have it even if I don't use it.

530
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:10,333
You have to listen while you're in here,

531
01:07:11,583 --> 01:07:12,916
or we'll all end up dead.

532
01:07:15,958 --> 01:07:17,250
I'm not afraid.

533
01:07:18,416 --> 01:07:21,708
I'm going to find my sister
and take her home.

534
01:07:56,833 --> 01:07:58,083
Shit!

535
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:01,500
Yod!

536
01:08:08,208 --> 01:08:09,083
Yos!

537
01:08:12,583 --> 01:08:13,625
Yos!

538
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,041
Yos!

539
01:08:30,166 --> 01:08:31,041
Yos!

540
01:08:32,666 --> 01:08:33,583
Yak.

541
01:09:03,666 --> 01:09:06,166
If you wish to save your sister,
follow me.

542
01:09:12,958 --> 01:09:14,625
I've been here before.

543
01:09:15,375 --> 01:09:16,541
What? When?

544
01:09:17,833 --> 01:09:19,083
When we used the spirit board.

545
01:09:22,875 --> 01:09:24,541
It wanted me to come here.

546
01:09:28,666 --> 01:09:30,000
Let's go.

547
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:31,041
Wait.

548
01:09:33,416 --> 01:09:34,583
Remember this.

549
01:09:36,208 --> 01:09:38,166
From here on out,

550
01:09:39,333 --> 01:09:41,416
you need to keep your guard up.

551
01:09:50,791 --> 01:09:52,000
Stay alert, Sarge.

552
01:10:44,083 --> 01:10:45,083
Sarge?

553
01:10:53,333 --> 01:10:55,333
Looks like a worship ritual.

554
01:10:55,875 --> 01:10:57,416
Not worshipping,

555
01:10:58,583 --> 01:11:00,208
but subduing the evil spirit.

556
01:11:06,666 --> 01:11:09,416
Sayador knew the spirit would return,

557
01:11:10,875 --> 01:11:15,250
so he had his disciples paint this
to warn other people.

558
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:33,333
Yee.

559
01:11:39,291 --> 01:11:40,333
Yee!

560
01:11:43,291 --> 01:11:44,208
Yee!

561
01:11:56,041 --> 01:11:57,125
Sarge?

562
01:12:21,083 --> 01:12:22,041
Yak?

563
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:23,666
Yak!

564
01:13:21,291 --> 01:13:22,208
Yak!

565
01:13:24,041 --> 01:13:24,916
Yak!

566
01:13:29,291 --> 01:13:30,250
Yak!

567
01:13:52,583 --> 01:13:53,583
Watch out!

568
01:14:24,333 --> 01:14:25,333
This way!

569
01:15:11,291 --> 01:15:12,625
<i>Are you sure they work?</i>

570
01:15:13,291 --> 01:15:15,500
<i>Only if you believe.</i>

571
01:15:42,208 --> 01:15:43,458
This way.

572
01:15:52,041 --> 01:15:53,416
Don't!

573
01:15:54,333 --> 01:15:56,166
That might not be your sister.

574
01:15:58,875 --> 01:15:59,916
Yak.

575
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,250
Help me, Yak.

576
01:16:04,333 --> 01:16:05,583
Yad!

577
01:16:05,666 --> 01:16:07,125
- Yak.
- Yad.

578
01:16:08,208 --> 01:16:12,958
- What are you doing here?
- I was taken here.

579
01:16:13,583 --> 01:16:14,416
Damn it!

580
01:16:18,833 --> 01:16:21,208
It lured us here to wake that spirit.

581
01:16:21,291 --> 01:16:23,375
Let's get out of here.

582
01:16:27,208 --> 01:16:29,500
Yee.

583
01:16:29,583 --> 01:16:30,833
Yee!

584
01:16:31,625 --> 01:16:33,041
Wake up, Yee!

585
01:16:33,125 --> 01:16:34,000
Yee.

586
01:16:34,875 --> 01:16:36,541
Wake up, Yee!

587
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:39,041
Yee.

588
01:16:39,625 --> 01:16:40,625
It's me.

589
01:16:41,541 --> 01:16:42,875
I'm here.

590
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:46,208
Yee...

591
01:16:47,791 --> 01:16:49,083
It's me, Yak.

592
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,166
See? It's me.

593
01:16:54,791 --> 01:16:57,208
I'm getting you out, all right?

594
01:17:00,833 --> 01:17:01,875
Yak?

595
01:17:12,833 --> 01:17:13,875
It's all right.

596
01:17:13,958 --> 01:17:16,916
I'm right here. It's going to be okay.

597
01:17:18,041 --> 01:17:19,458
What about those spirits?

598
01:17:22,375 --> 01:17:25,333
Don't worry. I'm right here.

599
01:17:26,291 --> 01:17:27,958
If they show up,

600
01:17:28,041 --> 01:17:30,625
I'll punch them in the face.

601
01:17:31,125 --> 01:17:32,041
Bam!

602
01:17:37,291 --> 01:17:40,375
Come. Let's get out of here.

603
01:17:40,458 --> 01:17:43,291
- Let's go.
- This way.

604
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:46,791
Come.

605
01:17:49,291 --> 01:17:50,625
Yee?

606
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:53,500
Come on.

607
01:17:56,958 --> 01:17:57,916
Yak?

608
01:17:58,666 --> 01:17:59,583
Yak?

609
01:18:27,541 --> 01:18:29,916
What are you doing?

610
01:18:55,291 --> 01:18:57,083
That evil spirit

611
01:18:58,375 --> 01:19:00,208
killed tons of people.

612
01:19:02,333 --> 01:19:04,250
Why do you want to wake it up?

613
01:19:11,625 --> 01:19:13,708
As long as humans roam,

614
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:17,500
war will follow.

615
01:19:18,833 --> 01:19:21,583
Dà Yòu gave me a new life.

616
01:19:22,416 --> 01:19:25,750
My people and I will live forever.

617
01:19:29,125 --> 01:19:31,250
At the expense of other people's lives?

618
01:19:31,333 --> 01:19:36,375
I don't care about other people
as long as we survive.

619
01:19:36,958 --> 01:19:41,083
I must live
to protect the land of my ancestors.

620
01:19:42,791 --> 01:19:44,875
What kind of hellish spirit is this?

621
01:19:46,208 --> 01:19:48,083
And why do you revere it?

622
01:19:48,708 --> 01:19:51,500
Dà Yòu hates two things.

623
01:19:52,833 --> 01:19:54,000
War

624
01:19:54,958 --> 01:19:56,833
and love.

625
01:19:58,375 --> 01:20:00,750
The stronger their love,

626
01:20:00,833 --> 01:20:07,125
the more Dà Yòu wants to make them suffer.

627
01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:10,500
<i>And this?</i>

628
01:20:10,583 --> 01:20:12,250
<i>This is what I get?!</i>

629
01:20:18,958 --> 01:20:22,208
I will have my revenge on you all!

630
01:20:28,125 --> 01:20:30,500
That is one wicked spirit, all right.

631
01:20:34,458 --> 01:20:36,041
Too bad

632
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:39,958
I already sent it back to hell.

633
01:20:44,375 --> 01:20:46,583
Dà Yòu only returned to her slumber.

634
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:52,916
I'll awaken her again
with a new, worthy host.

635
01:21:00,875 --> 01:21:03,541
A tooth from the host.

636
01:21:08,958 --> 01:21:10,000
Yak...

637
01:21:21,875 --> 01:21:24,833
And blood from the one
who defeated Dà Yòu.

638
01:21:27,208 --> 01:21:28,458
Yak!

639
01:21:28,541 --> 01:21:29,583
Yak!

640
01:21:29,666 --> 01:21:30,833
Yak...

641
01:21:37,041 --> 01:21:38,458
Yak!

642
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,500
Yak.

643
01:21:50,875 --> 01:21:53,083
The offering is ready.

644
01:21:54,375 --> 01:21:56,416
Now we just need

645
01:21:57,958 --> 01:22:00,083
an untainted soul.

646
01:22:02,125 --> 01:22:06,083
- Yak...
- With this, Dà Yòu will regain her power.

647
01:22:07,541 --> 01:22:08,500
No!

648
01:22:09,416 --> 01:22:11,708
After tonight,

649
01:22:12,416 --> 01:22:14,416
Dà Yòu will rise again.

650
01:22:15,333 --> 01:22:19,583
My people and I will live forever.

651
01:22:22,166 --> 01:22:25,916
You old fucking hag! Take me instead!

652
01:22:38,416 --> 01:22:40,250
Now, the gate of hell opens.

653
01:23:05,708 --> 01:23:07,625
Leave my baby alone.

654
01:23:14,125 --> 01:23:15,833
- No!
- Yad!

655
01:23:15,916 --> 01:23:18,458
- Yad!
- No!

656
01:23:18,541 --> 01:23:20,000
No! Don't!

657
01:23:20,083 --> 01:23:21,083
No!

658
01:23:21,166 --> 01:23:23,500
- No! Don't!
- Yad!

659
01:23:37,625 --> 01:23:38,708
Yad!

660
01:23:42,333 --> 01:23:44,333
- No!
- Yad!

661
01:23:49,291 --> 01:23:50,333
Look out!

662
01:24:02,708 --> 01:24:04,000
No!

663
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:14,250
Help Yee first. Hurry up!

664
01:24:18,625 --> 01:24:21,833
Sarge, how does your gun work?

665
01:24:21,916 --> 01:24:23,791
Those sacred bells are holy.

666
01:24:23,875 --> 01:24:26,833
They have mercury sealed inside.

667
01:24:29,083 --> 01:24:30,666
The mural on the wall...

668
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,083
<i>Sayador sealed
that evil spirit in the coffin.</i>

669
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:40,500
We must put mercury into its forehead.

670
01:24:42,625 --> 01:24:47,000
Only a strong-willed person
can get rid of them for good.

671
01:24:47,083 --> 01:24:48,833
I loaded the bullets with mercury.

672
01:24:48,916 --> 01:24:50,791
But there's only one left.

673
01:24:50,875 --> 01:24:52,333
You can't miss.

674
01:24:58,333 --> 01:25:01,125
Take care of everyone. I'll handle this.

675
01:25:05,541 --> 01:25:06,791
Get up.

676
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,750
Come on. Hurry up!

677
01:25:12,875 --> 01:25:15,125
- Yad!
- Hey!

678
01:25:15,208 --> 01:25:16,666
Yak!

679
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:34,875
Kongmu!

680
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,291
Yakhin...

681
01:26:01,291 --> 01:26:03,625
- Yak.
- Yad.

682
01:26:05,208 --> 01:26:07,166
Sarge.

683
01:26:08,958 --> 01:26:11,250
- Yad.
- Are you all right?

684
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:13,791
Yad.

685
01:26:14,958 --> 01:26:16,750
- Yad?
- I can't...

686
01:26:16,833 --> 01:26:19,333
- Sarge!
- Sarge?

687
01:26:19,416 --> 01:26:23,333
Yak! Yad's about to give birth!
The baby's coming out.

688
01:26:25,791 --> 01:26:28,875
What... what do we do, Sarge?

689
01:26:29,833 --> 01:26:31,916
Yak, what should we...?

690
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,541
- Yak.
- Sarge, can you deliver a baby?

691
01:26:34,625 --> 01:26:37,333
I deal with herbs, not childbirth!

692
01:26:38,708 --> 01:26:40,375
You're our best hope now!

693
01:26:41,708 --> 01:26:42,791
Come on, Sarge.

694
01:26:42,875 --> 01:26:44,583
- Please.
- Help her.

695
01:26:46,875 --> 01:26:48,250
- Push, dear. Push.
- Push.

696
01:26:49,083 --> 01:26:50,166
A bit more.

697
01:26:51,625 --> 01:26:52,750
Push!

698
01:26:56,833 --> 01:26:58,625
- A little more.
- Push.

699
01:26:59,708 --> 01:27:01,500
Now, one more time.

700
01:27:14,833 --> 01:27:18,125
Dà Yòu...

701
01:27:18,208 --> 01:27:20,166
Keep pushing.

702
01:27:20,250 --> 01:27:22,875
One more time, Yad.

703
01:27:25,250 --> 01:27:26,458
Push!

704
01:27:29,291 --> 01:27:31,291
- Come on.
- One more time. Push!

705
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:37,291
Almost there. Push!

706
01:27:44,125 --> 01:27:46,291
Yak, you're an uncle now.

707
01:27:47,625 --> 01:27:48,541
Yak.

708
01:27:50,875 --> 01:27:53,666
It's a boy. A boy.

709
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:56,500
Yad.

710
01:28:21,458 --> 01:28:23,041
Our doctor.

711
01:29:04,291 --> 01:29:05,541
Sarge!

712
01:29:07,125 --> 01:29:09,291
- Sarge!
- Sarge!

713
01:29:12,875 --> 01:29:15,541
I'm back, Yak.

714
01:29:27,208 --> 01:29:29,708
How many times do I have to kill you, huh?

715
01:29:37,791 --> 01:29:38,958
Damn it!

716
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,166
Please help me, Puth.

717
01:29:46,333 --> 01:29:48,625
- Yak!
- Yak!

718
01:30:00,750 --> 01:30:02,875
I'll take Yee's body

719
01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:06,041
and devour the fucking rest of you.

720
01:30:11,125 --> 01:30:13,125
An untainted soul.

721
01:30:26,041 --> 01:30:27,875
We released you,

722
01:30:28,666 --> 01:30:30,541
but you slaughtered us all.

723
01:30:33,125 --> 01:30:34,875
We dead people don't die twice.

724
01:30:35,583 --> 01:30:37,958
You've killed me before.

725
01:30:38,041 --> 01:30:39,833
It won't work again.

726
01:30:41,208 --> 01:30:43,000
You pieces of shit
can't do anything to me!

727
01:30:51,333 --> 01:30:54,791
The birth water is holy.
The power of life can undo all evil!

728
01:30:59,750 --> 01:31:01,083
Kongmu!

729
01:31:02,375 --> 01:31:03,583
Kongmu!

730
01:31:36,083 --> 01:31:37,000
Yod!

731
01:31:59,916 --> 01:32:03,375
It's time to stop tormenting my family,
you shit-faced ghost.

732
01:32:25,375 --> 01:32:27,583
Send it back to hell
before the gate closes!

733
01:32:49,458 --> 01:32:52,458
Sarge! Hang in there.

734
01:32:53,208 --> 01:32:54,458
Sarge!

735
01:32:55,208 --> 01:32:57,041
Please stay with me.

736
01:33:27,083 --> 01:33:28,375
Stay with me, Sarge.

737
01:33:46,875 --> 01:33:48,416
Yak!

738
01:33:53,458 --> 01:33:56,500
Come back, Yak!

739
01:34:01,375 --> 01:34:02,750
Yak...

740
01:34:05,083 --> 01:34:06,250
Yak!

741
01:34:06,333 --> 01:34:08,500
- Yak!
- Yak!

742
01:34:09,458 --> 01:34:10,708
- Yak!
- Yak!

743
01:34:13,208 --> 01:34:14,166
Yak...

744
01:34:14,250 --> 01:34:16,208
Yak.

745
01:34:23,541 --> 01:34:25,583
Yak...

746
01:34:25,666 --> 01:34:28,791
I sent it back to hell, all right?

747
01:34:30,208 --> 01:34:31,791
It can't come back anymore.

748
01:34:42,166 --> 01:34:43,500
Hey.

749
01:34:50,083 --> 01:34:51,875
Sarge?

750
01:34:51,958 --> 01:34:53,041
Sarge.

751
01:34:56,250 --> 01:34:57,208
Sarge.

752
01:35:03,625 --> 01:35:06,291
Hey, you still with me?

753
01:35:11,458 --> 01:35:16,750
- Hey, you still with me?
- You're going to be all right.

754
01:35:21,166 --> 01:35:22,791
Live a good life, little one.

755
01:35:26,375 --> 01:35:27,500
Yak.

756
01:35:28,416 --> 01:35:31,041
I don't think I'm making it.

757
01:35:33,166 --> 01:35:36,708
You've been through worse.
This is nothing, right?

758
01:35:37,708 --> 01:35:39,250
I'll take you home.

759
01:35:42,041 --> 01:35:43,250
All right? Let's go.

760
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:49,625
- Yes. Let's go home, Sarge.
- You can do it.

761
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,375
I'm so happy

762
01:35:53,250 --> 01:35:56,125
that you all can finally be together.

763
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:08,416
Life's too short, you know.

764
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:12,291
Be kind to each other.
Cherish every moment together.

765
01:36:15,125 --> 01:36:17,250
No matter what happens,

766
01:36:18,416 --> 01:36:20,208
stay together.

767
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:23,541
Never let go.

768
01:36:26,750 --> 01:36:28,208
Sarge.

769
01:36:28,291 --> 01:36:29,625
Sarge.

770
01:36:31,541 --> 01:36:32,625
Sarge...

771
01:36:32,708 --> 01:36:34,916
Sarge.

772
01:36:37,958 --> 01:36:38,958
Yak.

773
01:36:40,125 --> 01:36:43,250
Please tell Nampetch...

774
01:36:45,416 --> 01:36:50,750
to forgive me for never telling her
how much I love her.

775
01:36:53,291 --> 01:36:56,041
No. You'll be able to do that yourself.

776
01:36:56,125 --> 01:36:57,250
Sarge...

777
01:36:58,875 --> 01:37:02,125
I promised her I would come back...

778
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,333
but I don't think
I'll be able to keep my word.

779
01:37:07,416 --> 01:37:09,500
Please, Sarge...

780
01:37:11,750 --> 01:37:13,125
Yak.

781
01:37:18,625 --> 01:37:23,250
- Look after her, will you?
- Sarge...

782
01:37:24,583 --> 01:37:26,583
- Sarge?
- Sarge?

783
01:37:28,750 --> 01:37:30,250
- Sarge!
- No!

784
01:37:30,333 --> 01:37:31,291
Sarge!

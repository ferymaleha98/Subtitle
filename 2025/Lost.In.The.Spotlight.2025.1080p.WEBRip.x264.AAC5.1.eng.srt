3
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:18,333
This can't go on! They've gone too far.

4
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:22,375
For the honor of this kingdom,
we must seek revenge.

5
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:23,625
SATYA KENCANA ELEMENTARY

6
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:24,541
And you...

00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:25,750
ART PERFORMANCE

8
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:27,208
My best knight.

9
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:29,458
You are to lead my army
on the battlefield.

10
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:41,666
Thank you, my king.

11
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:45,833
I will make sure all of them perish.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
To war!

13
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:54,208
To war!

14
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,083
Vino!

15
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:05,500
- Mommy!
- Mom!

16
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:11,291
I'm so proud of you.

17
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:13,916
It's nothing, Mom.
It was only a small part.

18
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,750
Everything big
starts from something small.

19
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:20,666
You're right.

20
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,375
Better than playing a tree.

21
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,833
Weird. Who carries trees around?

22
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:37,125

00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:13,875
<i>On this dam, I want my feelings set free.</i>

35
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:14,875
<i>Will you dam it...</i>

43
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:46,250

Vino.

46

Congratulations.

47
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:22,333
Lukman Sardi. My idol.

48
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:23,666
Congratulations.

49
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,208
Please.

50
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,208
I really didn't expect this.

51
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:36,666
Right. Please give a round of applause
for my opponents here, Arie...

52
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:40,125
Then Kristo. Where are you, Kristo?

53
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,208
There he is.

54
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,291
That's enough.

55
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,500
Just relax, guys.

56
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:54,541
I'm sure next year you can win. Okay?

57
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:56,791
As long as I'm not there.

58
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,875
So annoying. I'll break his leg.

59
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,833
Why would you do that?

60
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:07,916
His hands?

61
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,041
The left one, okay?

62
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,000
So he can't wipe his butt.

63
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,291
My manager, Hasto.

64
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,041
Thank you so much, Hasto.

65
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,250
And for my favorite producer,

66
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,458
Mr. Amir, from Bima Sakti Pictures.

67
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,208
And last but not least,

68
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:34,250
<i>to all my fans, wherever you are.</i>

69
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,166
<i>This award is for you.</i>

00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,541
<i>I love you!</i>

71
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,958
<i>For the next category, please welcome</i>

72

<i>Dion Wiyono.</i>

73
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,458
<i>You're number 37.</i>

74
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:48,208
If you don't mind me asking,
which number is up now?

75
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,250
Nineteen.

76
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,041
- Nineteen?
- You may sit first.

77
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,833
San, they're still on 19.

78
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:59,666
If you stay here too long,
your boss will be mad.

79
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,166
May I borrow this?

80
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,791
Want me to help you practice the lines?

81
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:04,958
Sure.

82
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,958
You play Thug 3.

83
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,000
- Thug 3?
- This one.

84
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:15,916
Sir, please don't.
I just started selling this morning.

85
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,541
Nothing is sold yet.

86
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:18,500
Shut up!

87
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,333
San...

88
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,625
Don't act pitiful!

89
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,375
No need to be that serious, San.

90
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,958
It's okay. It will make the dialog better.

91
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,500
Give me the money,

92
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,208
or I'll burn your cart!

93
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,541
Well?!

94
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,375
There are no more lines.

95
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,083
This is my brother.

96
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:43,958
Biological.

97
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:50,583
Don't do that, man.

98
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,166
- How's Winky?
- Good.

99
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,125
- Okay, good.
- The guest list is good.

100
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,125
Andi's coming.

101
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:58,083
- Andi... That Andi?
- Yes.

102
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:01,791
- Gosh, Dim. Why did you invite him?
- It's Andi. How could you not invite him?

103
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,625
- You know him, right?
- Yes. Just relax.

104
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,416
- What if it gets awkward?
- I'll handle it.

105
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,958
Vin, congrats.

106
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,750
Thank you. Thank you so much.

107
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,416
- Sure.
- Excuse us.

108
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,458
- Wait.
- What now?

109
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,833
- Don't tell me you...
- No, I didn't.

110
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,041
Look at me.

111
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,125
No, I didn't invite your brother. Happy?

112
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,375
Don't you dare.

113
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,041
That's so strange.

114
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:35,041
- Is this an omen?
- You're too superstitious!

115
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:36,791
Where are you going?

116
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:40,125
Home. What if it's ended already?
Fans will ask for photos.

117
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:42,916
Hasto already called the media.
Do the doorstop first.

118
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,166
Damn it...

119
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,750
Hello.

120
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:50,791
How are you?

121
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,291
Fine, thanks.

122
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:53,958
I've been waiting for you.

123
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,375
Wow.

124
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:58,583
Vino, how does it feel
to get two nominations at once?

125
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,125
It's okay.

126
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:04,125
Word is you're now the highest-paid actor,
beating Reza.

127
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,083
Come on.

128
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,666
I always have been.

129
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,541
They just found out.

130
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,541
Vino, will there be
a mega project after this?

131
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:16,791
Every movie with Vino Agustian in it
is a mega project.

132
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:19,708
Cocky, but right.

133
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:20,958
Let's take a photo.

134
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,583
Give us your cockiest smile.

135
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,541
LOST IN THE SPOTLIGHT

136
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:34,458
- Where's Manda?
- I think she's on the way.

137
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:37,916
What? Call her. Tell her to come quickly.

138
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,541
All good, huh?

139
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,750
- All good. Cheers, Vin.
- Nice.

140
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,000
This can't be.

141
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:49,458
Next time he can't be late. Okay?

142
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:50,958
You're crazy.

143
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,666
- Where to, miss?
- Shut it.

144
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,833
- My Libra buddy!
- Hey.

145
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,333
Sorry I'm late. My motorcycle was...

146
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,500
Forget it. Come in, quick.

147
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:10,458
Vino is waiting. Where have you been?

148
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,083
Vin! Andi!

149
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,666
Andi, my bro!

150
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:18,125
Damn, I thought you weren't coming.
Thank you.

151
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,666
- Thanks a lot.
- Of course.

152
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,083
- Congrats. Two trophies, huh?
- Three, man.

153
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:25,291
Right. Two Best Actors
and one Best Supporting Actor?

154
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,958
Winky, this is Andi. This is Winky.

155
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,875
- Hi. Winky.
- Andi.

156
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:34,625
So, Dimi, Andi, and I
have been buddies since college.

157
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:37,166
Back when we were
just shabby college kids.

158
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,916
Back then? I still am, Vin.

159
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:44,166
No, you're not too shabby.

160
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,916
Come on, drink up. Here.

161
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
- Sorry. Thank you.
- Drink up.

162
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,333
- What?
- I don't drink.

163
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,791
Shabby people can drink too.
Come on. Cheers.

164
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,416
- It's a party.
- Don't.

165
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,000
- Why?
- He'll get tipsy.

166
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,625
- You ride a bike, right?
- Yes.

167
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:59,125
Then don't. No.

168
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,125
Vin...

169
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,541
Vino! Come here.

170
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,250
Flo! I'm coming.

171
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,875
Damn.

172
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,250
- It'll be a waste. Wait.
- You're crazy.

173
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,875
How's your documentary, Dim?
Still working on it?

174
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:27,125
I do have plans to do it.

175
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,583
That's cool.

176
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:34,916
It's time for people to know that
behind the glamour of the movie industry,

177
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,625
the work of a crew
is anything but glamorous, right?

178
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,916
Yeah, well, but you know how it is.

179
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,833
It's not easy to get funding
for documentaries.

180
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,958
And my movie might upset those producers.

181
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:51,791
So now I'm just taking my time
working with Vino.

182
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,416
You can watch and learn for free.

183
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:56,708
What about your movie?

184
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:59,125
The investor's on board. Wish me luck.

185
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,333
- Amen, all the best.
- Amen.

186
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,916
But...

187
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,958
Are they okay
with your strange movie title?

188
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:13,291
<i>Mata, Lidah, Telinga.</i>
What's so strange about it?

189
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,833
It's poetic. Poetic!

190
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:21,916
I mean, it's more like a roll call
for body parts. Just saying.

191
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:28,833
About that, Dim...

192
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,916
I want Vino to be the lead.

193
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,500
Think he'll agree?

194
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,791
Of course I will. Are you crazy?

195
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:39,750
Are you serious?

196
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:44,333
Of course. It'd be crazy
if I weren't in my buddy's first movie.

197
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,083
- Too crazy.
- No kidding, right?

198
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,583
Damn it, now what?

199
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:50,375
Attention, please.
Guys, please gather here. All of you.

200
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,166
Guys, I want to propose a toast.

201
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:58,000
For my best friend. Your friend.

202
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,500
Best Actor at the Indonesian Movie Awards.

203
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,583
Vino Agustian!

204
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,875
- Vin.
- What is it?

205
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,666
- Give a speech for us.
- Damn...

206
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,625
Come on. Vino!

207
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:15,541
Vino! Vino! Vino!

208
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:19,791
I just want to say thank you so much
for coming here, guys.

209
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:25,500
I couldn't have made it
without all of your support.

210
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,833
Without all of you,

211
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:34,166
I could be much greater than this!

212
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,750
You guys are just slowing me down!

213
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,166
Vin. That's enough, come on.

214
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,541
- Hey, not yet, Vin!
- Hold on.

215
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,833
Come on. Wait a second, will you?

216
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:52,458
There's something very important
that I need to say to you guys.

217
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:58,958
Nowadays, our movie industry
is trash, you know?

218
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:03,500
Actors like me don't get paid much.

219
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,708
- That's true.
- Right?

220
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:10,416
Those damn producers took all the money.

221
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,500
- Indeed.
- Right?

222
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,583
Yet without me,

223
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:18,500
do you think this movie would be a hit?

224
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,708
Successful? No way.

225
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:21,958
No, never.

226
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,916
Audiences are coming to movies,

227
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,458
thanks to whom?

228
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:30,708
Thanks to me!

229
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:34,791
- Thanks to Vino! Cheer for him!
- Yeah!

230
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:38,083
They get to enjoy the movie.

231
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:43,000
They can cry, laugh, thanks to whom?

232
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,750
Thanks to whom, Flo?

233
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:45,875
Thanks to you, Vin!

234
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:46,916
Thanks to me!

235
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,500
- Vino, enough.
- Not yet.

236
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,083
Go, Vino!

237
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,791
- I made them successful.
- You did.

238
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:56,500
And I don't need anyone!

239
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,875
Have some shame.

240
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,833
They are the ones who need me.

241
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:04,083
Vino Agustian!

242
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,458
- What? What happened?
- What?

243
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,833
Keep the party going!

244
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,458
Enough. Watch your step.

245
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:23,875
- Vin, that's for Teh Cangkir, okay?
- Okay.

246
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:28,416
As for Starmie, the contract extension
should be done next week.

247
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,291
Nice.

248
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:36,666
Okay, we'll leave in five minutes.
What else, Dim?

249
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,833
That's all.

250
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,375
Sorry, Hasto, there's one thing.
We have an overlapping schedule.

251
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:43,625
How can that be?

252
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:47,291
You scheduled one launching event
for Indosel's new product, right?

253
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:50,625
Vino already has a commitment
at that time.

254
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:55,625
Wait a minute.
I don't think we have a job that day.

255
00:13:55,708 --> 00:14:01,000
Well, yes, it is not a job.
We have Andi's movie screening.

256
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,083
Andy Lau?

257
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,166
No. Not him.

258
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:11,416
Andi, our friend.
He's making a short film.

259
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:15,208
That Andi, huh?

260
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,791
Look, Vin.

261
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,875
This kind of thing
is not good for your career.

262
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,750
It'd be an opportunity lost.

263
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:26,125
Dim. Tell your friend here.

264
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:27,458
The more jobs he gets,

265
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,125
the more bonuses you get.

266
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:31,541
Okay. Got it.

267
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,208
Look, Vin. From attending events

268
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:38,250
and coming to brand events,
we can approach these brands.

269
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,833
Maybe you can be their brand ambassador.

270
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:44,208
You're right. But I've promised him.

271
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:46,791
Suit yourself.

272
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:53,916
By the way, Vin, we're going
to Mr. Amir's office after this.

273
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,791
Mr. Dibyo will be there.

274
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:59,041
Remember, make a good impression.

275
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,875
This is a big project.

276
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,916
The biggest in both of our careers.

277
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:06,750
Understood?

278
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,666
I understand, Mr. Dibyo.

279
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,333
Don't worry.

280
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,583
We'll surely make a good one.

281
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:16,958
I'd rather not make a movie at all
than make a bad movie.

282
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,500
I'll be directing. I usually just produce.

283
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:24,875
If I'm actually directing myself,
it means this movie's super-duper special.

284
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,208
The thing is, Mr. Amir,

285
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,458
during my time as president,

286
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,583
Indonesia has had many achievements.

287
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:39,000
So I want this movie to maintain
my good image in the public eye.

288
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,375
Don't worry, Mr. Dibyo.

289
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:45,958
Vino here just won Best Actor.

290
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,916
Best Actor?

291
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:50,916
Indeed.

292
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,166
- Do you pray regularly?
- What?

293
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:57,666
"What"? Do you pray regularly?

294
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:01,583
Are you a Muslim?

295
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,500
Yes. Yes, sir.

296
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,916
All right. Don't skip your prayers, okay?

297
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,500
Of course, sir.

298
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,208
What about you, miss?

299
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,000
I'm a Christian, sir.

300
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,000
Oh, that's not it.

301
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:19,083
What I meant was we haven't met.
Who might you be?

302
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:25,166
That's right. Goodness, sir.

303
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,000
- I'm--
- Mr. Dibyo.

304
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:30,125
Let me introduce her. This is Sheila.

305
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:33,291
An actress specializing in melodramas.

306
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:37,375
After watching her movies,
people take selfies with puffy eyes.

307
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,500
Right, Sheil?

308
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,958
Their caption usually goes,
"I regret not bringing tissues!"

309
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,166
What do you mean?

310
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:52,125
Oh, that... How do I put it?

311
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,875
They couldn't wipe away their tears,

312
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:58,416
and the movie was so moving, so sad, sir.

313
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,708
Can't you wipe them on your shirt?

314
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,541
I suppose you can, sir. Yes.

315
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:10,541
Mr. Dibyo, I assure you.

316
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:13,791
Sheila will play First Lady
exceptionally well.

317
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:22,166
All right then, I'd like Vino and Sheila
to do a scene together.

318
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,916
- I want to see it. Can you?
- Sure.

319
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,833
Sure.

320
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,833
You can, right, Vin?

321
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:30,416
You can, right? Vino, Sheila?
You read the script. One scene, okay?

322
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,583
Ah! I know. I know.

323
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:35,625
The scene where you first argued.

324
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:38,666
Yes, it's when Mr. Dibyo
wanted to enter politics!

325
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,208
That's a good idea, Mr. Amir. Yes.

326
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,541
- Which scene?
- Scene 19.

327
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,833
- Right. Okay.
- Have you memorized it?

328
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:46,916
I have.

329
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,375
I understand...

330
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,166
You have good intentions.

331
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,333
You want to help a lot of people.

332
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,916
But please reconsider.

333
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,833
- Politics is not a game, dear.
- Enough.

334
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:21,833
Lastri, my dear.

335
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,125
Since when...

336
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,916
have you doubted my resolve?

337
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,916
What happened?

338
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:39,083
No matter how hard it gets,

339
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:40,708
I will...

340
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:44,041
never back down!

341
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,875
Sorry, I think that part was a bit off.

342
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,000
- Okay.
- I'll make it better.

343
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,916
It was a bit off.

344
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:12,666
No matter how hard it gets,
I will never back down.

345
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,583
Vin.

346
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,500
Vino, why don't you drink first?

347
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,541
I think Vino is a little dehydrated.

348
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:32,083
- Right?
- Yeah.

349
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,541
- Sorry, let's try it again. I was...
- Yes.

350
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,458
- I think you need to step it up.
- Yeah, I was a bit off too.

351
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:39,791
It's okay. Be confident.

352
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:40,916
It's okay.

353
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
- Keep up with me.
- Okay. I'm sorry, everyone.

354
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,291
Dear...

355
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,000
I understand.

356
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,750
You have good intentions.

357
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:09,375
You want to help more people,
but please reconsider.

358
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:19,458
Sulastri, Sulastri, Sulastri.

359
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:22,916
Sulastri.

360
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:31,833
Since when have you doubted my resolve?

361
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:38,416
No matter how hard it gets,
I, Sudibyo Sumarsono,

362
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,250
will never take a step back!

363
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:45,291
Not even one single step back!

364
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,416
Right?

365
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,791
Right! Long live the freedom!

366
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:06,541
Sorry, Mr. Dibyo.
Vino wasn't feeling well.

367
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,958
Are you trying to humiliate me, Mr. Amir?

368
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:15,291
If this movie fails,
I will sue you for defamation!

369
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:19,916
Sir.

370
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,125
Who is that?

371
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,791
I think I've seen him hung before.

372
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:30,041
Hanging on the wall. His photo, I mean.
A former president, right?

373
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,166
It's because you partied last night.

374
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,750
I told you this meeting was important.
You should've been ready.

375
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:40,625
I know. I'm so sorry.

376
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,250
So what do we do now?

377
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:46,250
Let me take care of it.
You go and see Dr. Yos.

378
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,416
Get yourself checked.

379
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,291
I don't need to see a doctor. I'm fine.

380
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,458
Get checked!

381
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,416
This must be a hex!

382
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,708
Shut up.

383
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:15,958
When you won Best Actor,
you beat Arie Kribo, right?

384
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:18,166
Rumor has it he uses black magic.

385
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,666
- Maybe he resents you for winning.
- Here we go again. Enough.

386
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,916
Your magic nonsense won't fool me.

387
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,333
But it makes sense, right?

388
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:29,041
You got hexed, so you can't act.
That means fewer competitors for him!

389
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:30,500
You're out of your mind.

390
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,500
Watch what you're saying.

391
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:34,250
Listen to this.

392
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:36,833
"Arie Kribo, born April 13th..."

393
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:38,166
He is a good person, Dim.

394
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,875
You're right.
Aries men are less problematic.

395
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:43,583
But what's his Chinese zodiac?

396
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:46,375
Fish dumplings.

397
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:53,083
Okay, then. Here.

398
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:55,166
Where is it? Here.

399
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,916
- What is it?
- Read this.

400
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,833
- I'm curious.
- I don't want to.

401
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:01,541
Vino, I want to see how you act, come on!

402
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:03,250
I'm exhausted.

403
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:06,375
Hasto told you to see a doctor, right?

404
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:09,166
Why don't we go to a psychic?

405
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:13,416
Vino, listen. I know a good one in Depok!

406
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,875
So my mom lost her gold necklace.

407
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:18,958
Then the psychic said
that someone close stole it.

408
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:21,666
Turned out, it was my uncle!
Isn't that cool?

409
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:27,583
Dimi, it's always someone close
who steals stuff, okay?

410
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:30,166
If they're far, how would they take it?
By courier?

411
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,916
You have a point.

412
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,416
I'll leave it to you.

413
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,333
Okay, sir.

414
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:40,625
You handle it. Okay?

415
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:43,041
I'll make sure everything turns out well.

416
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:45,208
- I'm off now.
- Okay, sir.

417
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:49,041
Hi!

418
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:51,083
It's you.

419
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:52,750
- How was it?
- Have a cigarette.

420
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:54,875
No, I don't...

421
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,666
Congrats on getting the role!

422
00:23:58,333 --> 00:23:59,666
Five scenes. Not bad.

423
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,750
Thank you. That's more than enough.

424
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:07,500
My brother here is still inexperienced,
but he's very talented.

425
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:11,041
So please guide him.

426
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:13,875
Sure, I will. Of course.

427
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:17,083
Right. My fee is 20%, okay?

428
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:22,416
I usually take 30.
You guys are new, so I'll take 20.

429
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:25,750
- What do you mean?
- Iksan.

430
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:27,333
My fee.

431
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:30,833
Once you get paid, send me 20%.

432
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:34,333
- Okay, I'll let you--
- Why is that necessary?

433
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:36,541
That's how things work.

434
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:38,458
I got him the role.

435
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:40,875
Share the wealth.

436
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:42,958
Yes.

437
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:44,875
But if you don't want to,

438
00:24:45,541 --> 00:24:46,875
that's okay.

439
00:24:48,708 --> 00:24:50,666
- Forget it, then. Thanks anyway.
- Iksan.

440
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:54,375
Okay, then.

441
00:24:57,416 --> 00:24:58,750
- Excuse us.
- All right.

442
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:02,500
San, come on.
Why didn't we take his offer?

443
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:05,375
This is my first role with a lot of lines.

444
00:25:05,458 --> 00:25:07,291
The character even has a name, "Yudhi."

445
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:09,583
Usually, it's just
"Resident 1," "Robber 2."

446
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:10,875
Now the name is "Yudhi."

447
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:13,750
- You are talented!
- That's cool.

448
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:15,458
We don't need it to be that way.

449
00:25:15,541 --> 00:25:18,000
But this is my chance!

450
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:21,000
- Tell me, why do you want to be an actor?
- What?

451
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:23,125
- Why do you want to be an actor?
- Well...

452
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:26,250
I want to know how it feels
to be anything I want.

453
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:30,458
Someone other
than this poor and mediocre Vino.

454
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:34,333
I want to be able to play
any character in a script.

455
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:38,250
It's fun, and I love it.
It's my childhood dream.

456
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:44,041
In movies, you can be
any character you want.

457
00:25:44,583 --> 00:25:46,791
But in real life,

458
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:49,791
you need to maintain one character.

459
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:51,083
Yeah, but...

460
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:54,416
We can always find another opportunity.

461
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:57,416
But if you lose your life values,

462
00:25:58,083 --> 00:26:00,000
you might not get them back.

463
00:26:07,458 --> 00:26:08,958
All right, come on.

464
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:14,541
I just refilled it.

465
00:26:17,916 --> 00:26:19,458
You don't need to.

466
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:24,166
So how is it?

467
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:26,458
Funny.

468
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:28,750
Are you going to extend the lease?

469
00:26:30,541 --> 00:26:34,500
- The thing is--
- Here we go again. "The thing is..."

470
00:26:35,041 --> 00:26:37,250
I know where this is going.

471
00:26:38,375 --> 00:26:41,458
I want to extend the lease.
What about my repair shop?

472
00:26:41,541 --> 00:26:43,333
What about my rent?

473
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:46,208
You're two months behind.

474
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:48,541
Well, the business has been slow.

475
00:26:48,625 --> 00:26:52,000
No wonder. You're too honest as a person.

476
00:26:52,833 --> 00:26:55,750
Learn from my younger brother.
He is smart.

477
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,916
He can invent any problem
even on a perfectly fine motorcycle.

478
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
What matters is money!

479
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:04,208
No, that's dishonest and unfair.

480
00:27:07,541 --> 00:27:09,125
Well, he is a jerk.

481
00:27:09,625 --> 00:27:11,458
I wonder where he learned to be like that?

482
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:16,416
Give me more time.
This is the last one. One more month.

483
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,750
If I still can't pay,

484
00:27:17,833 --> 00:27:19,500
I will leave.

485
00:27:19,583 --> 00:27:22,458
If you still don't pay by then,
you'll have to leave.

486
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:23,791
I've given up on you.

487
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:25,708
Okay?

488
00:27:40,708 --> 00:27:41,541
Sheesh.

489
00:27:50,541 --> 00:27:51,666
Not bad.

490
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:54,541
Got any rice?

491
00:27:56,416 --> 00:27:57,625
What about Mr. Amir?

492
00:27:57,708 --> 00:28:01,625
<i>He's calmed down. That's why.
Don't mess up again tomorrow.</i>

493
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:03,875
I understand, sorry for the mess.

494
00:28:03,958 --> 00:28:05,583
You're going to Dr. Yos, right?

495
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:06,625
<i>Yes, I'm on my way.</i>

496
00:28:06,708 --> 00:28:08,583
<i>All right, then. Bye.</i>

497
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,458
What? Hello?

498
00:28:12,083 --> 00:28:13,750
He hung up.

499
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:16,750
Sorry, Nad. Please continue.

500
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:20,750
Just like I said. He put his arm
around me on the first day.

501
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:23,708
I was very uncomfortable,
but I brushed it off

502
00:28:23,791 --> 00:28:26,958
rather than him thinking
I'm complicated or overreacting.

503
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:29,333
The next day, he sent me this.

504
00:28:41,708 --> 00:28:44,083
{\an8}LET'S DO THE READING
IN MY APARTMENT TOMORROW.

505
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:45,583
{\an8}OH, IS THAT SO?

506
00:28:45,666 --> 00:28:48,000
{\an8}SO WE CAN TAKE A BREAK WHEN WE GET TIRED

507
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:51,375
So what?

508
00:28:51,458 --> 00:28:53,041
"So what?"

509
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:55,375
Hasto, this is harassment.

510
00:28:55,958 --> 00:28:57,125
It's unacceptable!

511
00:28:57,208 --> 00:29:00,541
Just because he's a top director,
he can do whatever he wants?

512
00:29:01,875 --> 00:29:05,000
Okay, so what do you want to do now?

513
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:07,416
I've consulted
with the Women's Commission.

514
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:12,083
I'm going to post the entire story
on my Instagram tomorrow.

515
00:29:12,166 --> 00:29:14,125
Okay, Nad.

516
00:29:14,625 --> 00:29:15,625
Calm down.

517
00:29:15,708 --> 00:29:18,291
Don't let this small thing
turn into a big deal.

518
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:20,208
It'll trouble us all, Nad.

519
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:21,375
Small thing?

520
00:29:25,541 --> 00:29:27,041
Here's the thing.

521
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:29,875
Don't let it ruin your career.

522
00:29:30,666 --> 00:29:32,791
Okay, if you're uncomfortable,

523
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:35,000
you can back out of this project.

524
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:38,833
We're only in the reading stage.
I'll let them know.

525
00:29:38,916 --> 00:29:41,833
Now, you can take time to rest.

526
00:29:41,916 --> 00:29:43,541
Calm yourself down.

527
00:30:07,791 --> 00:30:12,208
<i>Hello, Hasto. How's Nadine?
I didn't do anything to her, you know.</i>

528
00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:17,041
It's all good. Don't worry.
She's a bit dramatic sometimes.

529
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,583
What's happening tomorrow?

530
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:21,083
Mr. Amir.

531
00:30:22,291 --> 00:30:23,916
Another reading session,

532
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:27,666
but with full makeup and costume,
so I can get in the zone.

533
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:32,916
Gosh! Vino!

534
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,541
What is it?

535
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,625
Look what Flo posted!

536
00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:39,125
{\an8}<i>I made them successful.</i>

537
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:42,875
{\an8}<i>I don't need anyone!</i>

538
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:46,000
{\an8}<i>They are the ones who need me!</i>

539
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:47,333
So what?

540
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:49,583
Vino Suvino!

541
00:30:49,666 --> 00:30:52,166
"I don't need anyone.
They are the ones who need me."

542
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,541
You're arrogant!

543
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:56,791
Come on, I was just caught up
in the euphoria!

544
00:30:56,875 --> 00:30:59,333
What does it have to do
with my current condition?

545
00:30:59,416 --> 00:31:01,666
You're not hexed. You're cursed.

546
00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:03,750
By whom?

547
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:04,708
By God, of course.

548
00:31:06,541 --> 00:31:07,958
You think God curses people?

549
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:10,625
A curse, a reprimand, whatever it is,

550
00:31:10,708 --> 00:31:15,333
you are cursed for being too arrogant!

551
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:18,541
Dim, please use your logic.

552
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:21,083
It must be some normal sickness.

553
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:22,708
Your problem is...

554
00:31:23,708 --> 00:31:24,583
Nothing.

555
00:31:26,958 --> 00:31:28,125
What do you mean?

556
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:31,000
Nothing's wrong with you.
You're perfectly fine.

557
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:35,000
Are you sure, doc?
You don't want to run a lab check?

558
00:31:35,583 --> 00:31:36,708
Or maybe an EKG?

559
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:39,083
Do you feel any particular symptoms?

560
00:31:39,166 --> 00:31:41,958
For no reason, he just can't seem to ac--

561
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:43,666
- Eczema!
- What?

562
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,666
- I can't have eczema.
- Eczema?

563
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,250
My skin is...

564
00:31:53,541 --> 00:31:54,750
incredibly flawless.

565
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:57,666
So sometimes I wonder,

566
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,541
what does eczema feel like?

567
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:01,416
It must be agonizing.

568
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,250
But I can't have it.

569
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:07,083
I'm confused.

570
00:32:09,208 --> 00:32:11,583
Listen. Just go home.

571
00:32:11,666 --> 00:32:13,958
Get enough rest and drink a lot of water.

572
00:32:14,041 --> 00:32:15,750
That's all from me, okay?

573
00:32:17,208 --> 00:32:18,333
Okay, doc.

574
00:32:19,666 --> 00:32:21,000
Uh, Vino.

575
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:22,333
Smoking.

576
00:32:25,833 --> 00:32:29,500
I mean, cut back on smoking.
I'm a doctor, Vin.

577
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:32,833
Idiot. You're an idiot.

578
00:32:32,916 --> 00:32:34,791
Got it. Thanks, doc.

579
00:32:35,666 --> 00:32:36,500
Thanks, doc.

580
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:41,458
He told you to cut back.

581
00:32:41,541 --> 00:32:43,541
Dr. Yos is very understanding.

582
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:48,458
You can lie, but why can't you act?

583
00:32:48,958 --> 00:32:49,833
What?

584
00:32:49,916 --> 00:32:55,166
You lied about eczema to Dr. Yos,
but you can't act.

585
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:56,625
Lying is acting too.

586
00:32:58,083 --> 00:32:59,458
You don't get it.

587
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:01,416
Acting is honesty.

588
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,375
- I know, but what I'm saying is...
- No, listen!

589
00:33:04,458 --> 00:33:06,333
Your curse is very specific!

590
00:33:06,416 --> 00:33:10,500
Usually, in movies, you have to
redeem yourself to go back to normal.

591
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:11,791
Wait.

592
00:33:12,583 --> 00:33:14,958
Tell me, what did I do wrong?

593
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:18,291
- I don't know--
- How can I redeem myself then?

594
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:21,375
Boss! Calm yourself down! Got it?

595
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:24,958
I am trying to help you,
but I need to think too.

596
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:27,750
Handle this by yourself. I'm done.

597
00:33:32,083 --> 00:33:36,666
When a woman gets mad
and walks away, hold her back!

598
00:33:37,166 --> 00:33:40,083
You're walking away? But I'm your ride.

599
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:45,625
Are you serious?

600
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:50,333
- The director really picked me?
- He did.

601
00:33:52,916 --> 00:33:54,916
It's only three scenes,

602
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,375
but if you give your best,
it'll help you get more roles.

603
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,250
Thank you so much, sir.

604
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:05,166
I will definitely give my best.

605
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,291
Good!

606
00:34:08,166 --> 00:34:09,291
Who's this?

607
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:13,750
This is my older brother. Iksan.

608
00:34:15,791 --> 00:34:17,666
He's also my manager.

609
00:34:21,583 --> 00:34:24,166
So I can follow this up with Iksan?

610
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,875
Right.

611
00:34:28,541 --> 00:34:30,833
I will do whatever he says.

612
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:33,375
I'm Iksan.

613
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:35,791
I'm Vino's manager.

614
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,041
Vino's manager.

615
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:44,375
This is all your fault!

616
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:46,125
Why do you always blame me?

617
00:34:46,208 --> 00:34:47,583
Well, it is your fault!

618
00:34:47,666 --> 00:34:48,541
Why is that?

619
00:34:48,625 --> 00:34:49,791
Okay, calm down.

620
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:53,083
Sometimes you're also wrong.

621
00:34:53,166 --> 00:34:55,583
Hey. You're defending her now?

622
00:34:55,666 --> 00:34:57,000
But it's true, right?

623
00:34:57,708 --> 00:35:00,833
Fine. You need to pay me back, right now!

624
00:35:03,458 --> 00:35:06,041
You're the wrong one! Stop playing victim!

625
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,833
Cut!

626
00:35:11,708 --> 00:35:12,958
Sorry. Did that hurt?

627
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:14,583
- Are you okay?
- I am.

628
00:35:14,666 --> 00:35:16,833
- Does it sting?
- Not yet.

629
00:35:17,375 --> 00:35:19,875
Was that... a real slap?

630
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:22,250
- Vino told me to.
- You did?

631
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:24,541
Just to make it look more real.

632
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:28,333
I see, so you can slap him harder then.

633
00:35:28,416 --> 00:35:30,583
Swing your hand to make it dramatic.

634
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:33,083
- Like this?
- Use your hip.

635
00:35:33,166 --> 00:35:34,708
- You play tennis, right?
- Yes.

636
00:35:34,791 --> 00:35:37,333
Just like a forehand. Right.

637
00:35:37,416 --> 00:35:39,041
Come on. Yeah, like that.

638
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:42,208
Open your legs a little.
Yes, that way. Right.

639
00:35:42,291 --> 00:35:44,583
Nice! One more time!

640
00:35:44,666 --> 00:35:46,416
- Ready!
- Let's roll!

641
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,333
Slate in!

642
00:35:47,416 --> 00:35:49,916
Slate 106, scene 39, shot one, take two...

643
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,166
THE LOVE MAFIA

644
00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:56,708
Fine. You need to pay me back, right now!

645
00:35:57,916 --> 00:36:00,875
You're the wrong one! Stop playing victim!

646
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:06,166
Cut!

647
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,333
- Are you okay?
- It hurts.

648
00:36:11,416 --> 00:36:14,125
Does it? Bring some ice here!

649
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,958
Okay, that was a very good shot.

650
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:18,625
Nice. Very cool!

651
00:36:18,708 --> 00:36:21,416
Okay, next shot,
we focus on this part. Here.

652
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,708
Focus on the impact!

653
00:36:22,791 --> 00:36:24,875
Okay? Next shot!

654
00:36:24,958 --> 00:36:26,250
Ready. Next shot.

655
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:28,041
Poor thing. Your face got smashed.

656
00:36:28,958 --> 00:36:30,041
I'm fine.

657
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:36,750
Should I slap the other side
to balance it?

658
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:38,625
San, stop joking.

659
00:36:39,583 --> 00:36:41,250
Look at you.

660
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:43,708
But that was cool.

661
00:36:43,791 --> 00:36:44,875
- Really?
- Yeah.

662
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:47,041
- Vino.
- Hi.

663
00:36:47,125 --> 00:36:48,291
Sorry.

664
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:51,625
The next take
is supposed to be your last scene,

665
00:36:51,708 --> 00:36:53,750
but Morgan wants us to take him first

666
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:56,041
because he has an early flight tomorrow.

667
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:57,000
I see.

668
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,375
So what time is mine?

669
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:01,833
Not long after. Maybe around midnight.

670
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:03,708
What time is it?

671
00:37:03,791 --> 00:37:04,750
Almost 9:00 p.m.

672
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:08,750
It'll take too long.
Are you okay with that?

673
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:10,125
It's fine.

674
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:14,041
- What's wrong?
- Mr. Hasto. The thing is...

675
00:37:14,125 --> 00:37:16,500
Morgan wants us
to take his scene first, and I...

676
00:37:16,583 --> 00:37:17,875
I see.

677
00:37:17,958 --> 00:37:21,500
Don't worry. I'll talk to Morgan.

678
00:37:21,583 --> 00:37:22,416
- Okay?
- You will?

679
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,333
- Take Vino's first.
- Is it okay?

680
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:25,833
Sure, it's okay.

681
00:37:25,916 --> 00:37:28,166
- Just follow the call sheet.
- Okay. Thank you.

682
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,208
Okay.

683
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:31,750
Thank you.

684
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:34,083
You're welcome. I'm Hasto.

685
00:37:34,583 --> 00:37:36,791
- I'm Vino.
- I'm Morgan's manager.

686
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:40,250
Can we talk for a moment, Vino?

687
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:43,583
- Sure.
- Okay?

688
00:37:44,083 --> 00:37:45,083
Wait a bit, okay?

689
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:48,458
You did a really good job.

690
00:37:48,958 --> 00:37:51,166
- Thanks.
- How long have you done this?

691
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:52,625
Acting like this?

692
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:55,416
Maybe around two years?

693
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,958
You've got a lot of potential,
but you need to...

694
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,583
Vino, my bro!

695
00:38:02,666 --> 00:38:05,833
Vino, Vino, Vino.
Brother, brother, brother.

696
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:07,250
Okay. Let's check.

697
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,708
Makeup... perfect.

698
00:38:09,791 --> 00:38:11,833
Wardrobe... perfect.

699
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:14,333
The only thing left is you.

700
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:18,916
But you're ready, right?

701
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:21,166
You are Vino, after all.

702
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:25,958
Remember, this is a movie
about our former president.

703
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:29,750
Indonesians are counting on you!

704
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,833
No pressure! No pressure!

705
00:38:32,916 --> 00:38:34,458
No pressure, okay?

706
00:38:34,541 --> 00:38:35,708
Yeah? Okay?

707
00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:37,458
This movie is going to flop.

708
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,125
No pressure.

709
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:41,458
You can do it.

710
00:38:43,208 --> 00:38:44,291
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

711
00:38:44,375 --> 00:38:45,541
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

712
00:38:45,625 --> 00:38:48,291
- Thank you.
- Sure. Please enjoy.

713
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:49,291
Thank you.

714
00:38:49,375 --> 00:38:50,625
- Thank you.
- Sure.

715
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:52,375
Mr. Vino.

716
00:38:52,458 --> 00:38:55,375
May I take a picture with you?

717
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,208
Sorry, I'm awkward.
I'm the new janitor here.

718
00:38:58,291 --> 00:38:59,750
Sure, no worries.

719
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,708
But post it later,
after the movie is released.

720
00:39:02,791 --> 00:39:04,458
- It's still a secret.
- Got it.

721
00:39:04,958 --> 00:39:06,375
Only for my WhatsApp story.

722
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,333
- Miss, can you help?
- Yes? Sure.

723
00:39:09,416 --> 00:39:11,666
Wait. I'm getting a picture.

724
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:14,666
Let's do this pose.

725
00:39:15,541 --> 00:39:16,583
Like this.

726
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:20,416
It's hard.

727
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:23,083
One, two, three.

728
00:39:24,458 --> 00:39:25,541
You can check it.

729
00:39:25,625 --> 00:39:28,541
Nice! This is what they call couple goals!

730
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:30,583
- Thanks.
- No worries.

731
00:39:30,666 --> 00:39:33,375
Mr. Vino. Let's take a selfie.

732
00:39:38,583 --> 00:39:41,041
Shall we have a cultural wedding?

733
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:43,833
I think Mexican.

734
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:47,958
Are you also an actress, miss?

735
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:49,458
No, I'm his assistant.

736
00:39:49,541 --> 00:39:50,916
Then I don't need your photo.

737
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,833
- Mr. Vino.
- Yes?

738
00:39:51,916 --> 00:39:53,166
Keep up the good work.

739
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,791
- Thank you.
- Sure.

740
00:39:58,708 --> 00:40:00,250
- Give me a moment.
- Okay.

741
00:40:03,166 --> 00:40:05,250
Just breathe, Vin. Come on.

742
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Going into labor?

743
00:40:12,666 --> 00:40:13,666
Vino.

744
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:15,958
- Ready.
- Sheila?

745
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:17,416
- Ready? Good.
- Ready.

746
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,333
Rian.

747
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,708
Tight shot. Okay? Good.

748
00:40:21,875 --> 00:40:23,000
Okay, ready?

749
00:40:23,583 --> 00:40:26,458
Vino! No, no, no! Sorry.

750
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,833
- Face to face now?
- Yes. Better that way.

751
00:40:31,916 --> 00:40:33,166
- Okay?
- Okay.

752
00:40:33,916 --> 00:40:34,750
Okay.

753
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:44,625
I have sacrificed everything for you.

754
00:40:48,708 --> 00:40:49,875
Everything.

755
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:54,333
I gave up everything to support
your ambition, and you lied to me?

756
00:40:57,625 --> 00:40:58,750
Lastri...

757
00:41:03,166 --> 00:41:04,750
I'm so sorry.

758
00:41:12,125 --> 00:41:13,458
I know...

759
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:16,041
I'm wrong.

760
00:41:21,833 --> 00:41:23,583
I'm so sorry.

761
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,458
Dear...

762
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,791
<i>Gomenasai.</i>

763
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:41,416
Please.

764
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,791
No, no, no, no.

765
00:41:44,875 --> 00:41:47,458
Everything I've done...

766
00:41:51,625 --> 00:41:54,416
is only for you!

767
00:42:05,625 --> 00:42:07,125
I can't, sir.

768
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:09,041
What's with you?

769
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:09,958
What?

770
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:12,958
Gosh...

771
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:14,166
Idiot.

772
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:18,666
I can't...

773
00:42:19,541 --> 00:42:21,500
I've tried, but...

774
00:42:25,166 --> 00:42:26,875
This will make it to FYP.

775
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,583
All good.

776
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,708
Everything went well.

777
00:42:33,541 --> 00:42:35,166
Yes. You're welcome.

778
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:38,458
<i>Our next story comes from
a fun moment with Kristo Manuel.</i>

779
00:42:38,541 --> 00:42:40,708
I hope Hasto doesn't find out.

780
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:42,833
<i>Celebrating the anniversary
of Kristolicious.</i>

781
00:42:42,916 --> 00:42:45,166
<i>Thank you to my fans from Kristolicious.</i>

782
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:46,875
KRISTO MANUEL'S FANBASE ANNIVERSARY

783
00:42:46,958 --> 00:42:51,541
<i>Thank you so much. Without you all,
I wouldn't be who I am today.</i>

784
00:42:51,625 --> 00:42:54,750
<i>For me, fans are my number one.</i>

785
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:56,291
<i>Kristolicious...</i>

786
00:42:58,458 --> 00:42:59,708
Oh my God, Vino!

787
00:42:59,791 --> 00:43:01,000
What now?

788
00:43:01,083 --> 00:43:02,791
Gosh!

789
00:43:03,583 --> 00:43:04,541
Amel!

790
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:05,875
Amel who?

791
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:06,791
Your fan!

792
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:07,916
I have many fans.

793
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,833
But how many of your fans
DM'ed you that they're very sick

794
00:43:10,916 --> 00:43:13,750
and their last wish is to meet you?

795
00:43:16,583 --> 00:43:17,750
Ring a bell?

796
00:43:17,833 --> 00:43:20,166
And what was your response?

797
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,375
- "See you."
- Right. "See you"!

798
00:43:22,458 --> 00:43:25,625
And you haven't seen her.
This is the answer, Vino.

799
00:43:25,708 --> 00:43:28,208
Wait a minute! Don't jump to conclusions.

800
00:43:28,291 --> 00:43:30,041
No, you have to meet her.

801
00:43:30,125 --> 00:43:33,041
You're bad! You lied to a dying person.
No wonder you're cursed.

802
00:43:33,125 --> 00:43:34,625
But how can you--

803
00:43:34,708 --> 00:43:36,250
You keep making excuses!

804
00:43:36,333 --> 00:43:37,166
Stop!

805
00:43:40,541 --> 00:43:41,833
Two things.

806
00:43:41,916 --> 00:43:45,666
One. I agree that you need to meet Amel.

807
00:43:46,166 --> 00:43:47,583
Don't be a bad person!

808
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:50,416
Two.

809
00:43:50,958 --> 00:43:53,500
Mr. Amir is waiting for you. Let's go.

810
00:43:55,458 --> 00:43:58,041
- What about Amel?
- Give me time!

811
00:43:58,125 --> 00:44:00,750
What if you don't have time
to see her, Vino?

812
00:44:03,833 --> 00:44:04,666
Bro!

813
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:06,291
Iksan!

814
00:44:08,416 --> 00:44:09,583
It's your fault, Nung.

815
00:44:10,541 --> 00:44:13,416
He can't hear anything
when he's wearing those headphones.

816
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,208
Why are you blaming me?

817
00:44:16,291 --> 00:44:18,875
It's normal for things to work perfectly
after being repaired.

818
00:44:18,958 --> 00:44:21,708
You should've made the sound
leak a little.

819
00:44:21,791 --> 00:44:23,375
I'll make your head leak!

820
00:44:25,708 --> 00:44:27,916
Iksan! Bro!

821
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,833
Maybe I just shove this in your mouth.
He's right there.

822
00:44:31,416 --> 00:44:32,750
You're stressing me out.

823
00:44:37,583 --> 00:44:40,000
Iksan. What did you say?

824
00:44:42,791 --> 00:44:43,625
Look.

825
00:44:46,833 --> 00:44:47,833
VINO'S ACTING IS BAD!

826
00:44:47,916 --> 00:44:49,583
<i>Everything I've done...</i>

827
00:44:50,666 --> 00:44:53,166
<i>is only for you!</i>

828
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:54,708
What's with him?

829
00:44:56,416 --> 00:44:57,500
I don't know.

830
00:45:00,041 --> 00:45:01,458
Has he gone mad?

831
00:45:03,208 --> 00:45:04,416
I don't get it.

832
00:45:08,125 --> 00:45:10,666
Vino, my brother. This is bad.

833
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:12,708
Luckily, the reading was private.

834
00:45:12,791 --> 00:45:15,500
If it were open
and someone filmed it and spread it,

835
00:45:15,583 --> 00:45:16,541
we'd be doomed.

836
00:45:17,083 --> 00:45:18,041
Sir!

837
00:45:18,583 --> 00:45:20,958
<i>Everything I've done...</i>

838
00:45:21,041 --> 00:45:22,666
See? We're done.

839
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:26,000
I have requested them to take it down.

840
00:45:26,083 --> 00:45:28,416
But it has been reposted
by many gossip accounts.

841
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,666
<i>...is only for you!</i>

842
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:31,708
I'm so dead.

843
00:45:31,791 --> 00:45:33,250
I'm so dead.

844
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,083
HASTO JUANDI

845
00:45:46,541 --> 00:45:48,125
MR. SUDIBYO

846
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:52,916
Mr. Amir.

847
00:45:54,416 --> 00:45:55,333
I have an idea.

848
00:45:56,375 --> 00:45:59,083
- Don't worry, Hasto.
- What do you mean?

849
00:45:59,166 --> 00:46:01,541
This has gone viral, Vin.

850
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:03,333
That means we pulled it off.

851
00:46:04,625 --> 00:46:05,833
Pulled what off?

852
00:46:05,916 --> 00:46:10,041
It's a gimmick.
The more viral it goes, the better.

853
00:46:10,125 --> 00:46:11,041
What?

854
00:46:11,541 --> 00:46:12,625
Are you serious?

855
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:17,166
Mr. Dibyo, it was all staged.
We designed this to go viral.

856
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:19,875
So people keep talking about it.
That's success, right?

857
00:46:19,958 --> 00:46:23,916
So that's what happened. That's brilliant!

858
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:24,875
Right?

859
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:29,791
It was Mr. Amir's idea to create hype.

860
00:46:30,291 --> 00:46:32,041
He always comes up with something.

861
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:35,958
Tell him to be careful.
His tricks are getting obvious.

862
00:46:36,041 --> 00:46:38,458
Netizens are smart these days.

863
00:46:38,958 --> 00:46:40,791
Sure. It's all good, sir.

864
00:46:48,208 --> 00:46:50,041
All good for now.

865
00:46:51,958 --> 00:46:54,875
Vino, my brother. What about you?

866
00:46:54,958 --> 00:46:57,916
If you don't get better,
then we have a real problem.

867
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,750
We start shooting next month.

868
00:46:59,833 --> 00:47:02,625
Don't worry, Mr. Amir. It's all good.

869
00:47:03,333 --> 00:47:04,333
All good?

870
00:47:06,875 --> 00:47:07,708
Vino.

871
00:47:10,791 --> 00:47:14,500
Have you found a way
to get back to your normal self?

872
00:47:20,541 --> 00:47:21,500
I have.

873
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,625
I have found a way.

874
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,041
- Sir?
- What?

875
00:47:28,125 --> 00:47:28,958
Sorry.

876
00:47:30,125 --> 00:47:31,333
It's a bit cramped here.

877
00:47:38,083 --> 00:47:39,291
LEWD DIRECTOR SCANDAL REVEALED!

878
00:47:39,375 --> 00:47:42,458
<i>I think everyone needs to know
that this still happens a lot.</i>

879
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:45,791
<i>So to break this cycle of harassment,</i>

880
00:47:45,875 --> 00:47:47,583
<i>I feel the need to speak up.</i>

881
00:47:47,666 --> 00:47:50,666
<i>You told the police.
Aren't you afraid of losing your job?</i>

882
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:53,125
<i>For now, I'm focusing on this case.</i>

883
00:47:53,708 --> 00:47:57,750
<i>As for my job,
I'll let my manager handle it.</i>

884
00:47:58,541 --> 00:48:00,041
Stupid!

885
00:48:01,625 --> 00:48:04,583
A MOVIE BY ANDI ARYADI

886
00:48:04,666 --> 00:48:05,708
Andi!

887
00:48:07,083 --> 00:48:08,791
- What was that?
- Don't be cruel.

888
00:48:08,875 --> 00:48:11,083
I'm not, I just don't get the ending.

889
00:48:11,166 --> 00:48:13,416
- Okay. Thanks.
- That's his style.

890
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,625
- But I--
- Just shut it, he's here.

891
00:48:15,708 --> 00:48:17,791
- Hi, guys!
- Hi!

892
00:48:17,875 --> 00:48:19,125
- Thanks for coming.
- Cool.

893
00:48:19,208 --> 00:48:20,875
- Insane.
- That was awesome.

894
00:48:21,583 --> 00:48:24,166
- Thanks for coming. Thank you.
- Congrats.

895
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:25,625
- Crazy.
- Congrats.

896
00:48:25,708 --> 00:48:27,416
- That was good.
- Thanks.

897
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,708
- What do you think, Vin?
- About what?

898
00:48:30,291 --> 00:48:31,625
The movie.

899
00:48:33,041 --> 00:48:33,958
I like it.

900
00:48:34,583 --> 00:48:37,208
Really. Especially the ending. That was...

901
00:48:37,291 --> 00:48:39,083
- Magnificent, right?
- So deep.

902
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:41,916
Awesome cinematography. Memet is the DP?

903
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,333
- Yes. Right?
- He has such good taste.

904
00:48:44,416 --> 00:48:46,041
- Memet's work?
- It is.

905
00:48:46,125 --> 00:48:49,041
I knew that had to be Memet's work.

906
00:48:49,125 --> 00:48:52,041
Vin, about our movie,
when can you start the reading?

907
00:48:52,625 --> 00:48:55,541
Our... movie?

908
00:48:55,625 --> 00:48:57,666
- Which movie--
- My movie.

909
00:48:58,958 --> 00:49:02,125
- Okay, your movie...
- That we discussed at your place.

910
00:49:02,916 --> 00:49:04,708
You said yes.

911
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:07,375
Oh, that movie.

912
00:49:07,958 --> 00:49:09,583
Okay, what about this?

913
00:49:09,666 --> 00:49:12,208
You just need to talk to Hasto.

914
00:49:12,291 --> 00:49:15,375
Discuss the schedule
and everything else with him.

915
00:49:15,458 --> 00:49:19,083
If he agrees,
I'll be ready to start the project.

916
00:49:19,166 --> 00:49:21,333
Okay? Don't worry.

917
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:23,916
- Okay.
- Shall we go?

918
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,416
Thank you. Thanks again.

919
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,791
You keep saying "Thank you."
Your movie is great!

920
00:49:28,875 --> 00:49:30,791
- Thank you. Okay.
- Congrats!

921
00:49:31,291 --> 00:49:34,125
- Congrats. See you. Bye.
- Bye.

922
00:49:34,625 --> 00:49:37,625
- Who is Memet?
- Shut it. You're being heartless.

923
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:38,750
What do you mean?

924
00:49:38,833 --> 00:49:41,791
Hasto will set a high price.
Andi will back out.

925
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:43,875
It's you who should talk to Hasto.

926
00:49:43,958 --> 00:49:46,625
- Okay, I'll talk to him.
- You will?

927
00:49:46,708 --> 00:49:49,416
- You're such a nag.
- You need to listen!

928
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:54,916
Ple.

929
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:06,666
The cleaner!

930
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:09,791
Oh, I thought you wanted to bond with me.

931
00:50:10,333 --> 00:50:13,000
You wanted the cleaner? Here you go.

932
00:50:14,291 --> 00:50:15,250
I misunderstood.

933
00:50:16,375 --> 00:50:17,666
Damn it!

934
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:20,666
What's wrong with this bike?
How could it be brought here?

935
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:22,625
Why are you always cranky?

936
00:50:22,708 --> 00:50:26,083
This old bike makes me crazy!
It's ancient...

937
00:50:26,166 --> 00:50:28,291
It smells like death!

938
00:50:28,375 --> 00:50:30,166
Maybe we should trade it for rice?

939
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:33,625
As if!
Even the rice vendor wouldn't take it!

940
00:50:33,708 --> 00:50:37,083
We should plant old bikes like this
to grow new ones.

941
00:50:39,541 --> 00:50:41,166
Don't be mean.

942
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:44,208
Mr. Dono's had it since high school.
It has a lot of memories.

943
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:46,541
He should've kept this as a memory.

944
00:50:46,625 --> 00:50:47,833
Not a ride, huh?

945
00:50:47,916 --> 00:50:50,916
Shut up! Want me to
fill your mouth with nitrogen?

946
00:50:51,958 --> 00:50:53,083
Excuse me.

947
00:50:55,083 --> 00:50:56,166
Jon.

948
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:00,208
What brings you here?

949
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:03,625
Please excuse us.
This is a potential tenant.

950
00:51:05,166 --> 00:51:08,583
I've told you I will extend the lease.

951
00:51:08,666 --> 00:51:11,291
- Why are you doing this?
- Look at you talking.

952
00:51:13,375 --> 00:51:15,458
I know.

953
00:51:15,541 --> 00:51:17,458
But I can't say no to him.

954
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:20,208
Who knows? You might actually leave.

955
00:51:20,291 --> 00:51:21,666
Who knows?

956
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,833
- Let's check out the house.
- Excuse me.

957
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:28,750
- Excuse me.
- Sorry for the mess.

958
00:51:29,625 --> 00:51:31,166
- Well...
- Oh, boy.

959
00:51:31,833 --> 00:51:34,083
Nice hair color. Where do you get it dyed?

960
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:40,916
Iksan.

961
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,916
Should I pour some oil on the pavement?

962
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,333
Who knows? Maybe he'll slip and fall.

963
00:51:46,416 --> 00:51:47,666
Who knows, right?

964
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:50,333
You're evil, Nung.
But I have two options here.

965
00:51:50,416 --> 00:51:53,000
Shit! Look at this! Look!

966
00:51:53,083 --> 00:51:54,625
They really did me dirty!

967
00:51:54,708 --> 00:51:57,333
Why would you watch it? Just ignore it!

968
00:51:57,416 --> 00:52:00,416
So what about Amel?
When are we going to visit her?

969
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:02,541
We need to solve this quickly.

970
00:52:02,625 --> 00:52:04,375
She sent her address, right?

971
00:52:04,458 --> 00:52:08,333
She did. But I don't think
the place is safe.

972
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:10,083
It's practically the slums.

973
00:52:10,583 --> 00:52:11,916
What are you afraid of?

974
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,291
You're used to being
surrounded by cougars.

975
00:52:14,375 --> 00:52:15,375
That's nothing!

976
00:52:15,875 --> 00:52:19,500
What if I get robbed? Or harassed?
Would you take responsibility?

977
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:21,750
- Harassed?
- Come on!

978
00:52:21,833 --> 00:52:24,958
You think only women can be harassed?
Men can be harassed too.

979
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:27,083
Well, you have a point.

980
00:52:27,166 --> 00:52:30,708
I know. What if we ask your brother
to take us there?

981
00:52:30,791 --> 00:52:31,875
Herman!

982
00:52:32,458 --> 00:52:34,083
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hello.

983
00:52:34,166 --> 00:52:35,916
She wouldn't stop talking.

984
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,083
It's okay. Herman is quite free today.

985
00:52:40,166 --> 00:52:41,875
Let's go in. Just follow Herman.

986
00:52:43,291 --> 00:52:45,750
"Herman"? Why is he acting cute?

987
00:52:45,833 --> 00:52:47,000
Can't he just say "I"?

988
00:52:47,083 --> 00:52:51,333
He's a salesman. It's just a trick
so people remember his name.

989
00:52:51,416 --> 00:52:52,666
Get out more.

990
00:52:56,333 --> 00:52:58,416
This is the pool.

991
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:02,750
You can chill here. It's fun, right?

992
00:53:02,833 --> 00:53:04,166
It is fun.

993
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:05,500
Right?

994
00:53:05,583 --> 00:53:08,708
Now, Herman will show you
the second floor. Shall we?

995
00:53:08,791 --> 00:53:09,791
Okay.

996
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:13,666
Vin, if you're afraid
to go to Amel's house,

997
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:15,708
let me ask your brother to--

998
00:53:15,791 --> 00:53:16,708
No.

999
00:53:17,458 --> 00:53:18,916
I know where this is going.

1000
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,583
Vino, Iksan is the best
at handling people.

1001
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:24,416
Remember when you almost
got beaten up in the parking lot?

1002
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,166
Yeah, I remember that.

1003
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:27,750
You pissed in your pants!

1004
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:28,916
I said I remember.

1005
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,500
Okay, sorry. My point is,
let's just ask for his help.

1006
00:53:33,583 --> 00:53:35,333
Why do you keep mentioning him?

1007
00:53:35,416 --> 00:53:37,500
Well, only he can help us.

1008
00:53:37,583 --> 00:53:39,041
Hello, Vino!

1009
00:53:41,458 --> 00:53:43,375
Herman is going to show you the bedroom.

1010
00:53:43,458 --> 00:53:45,625
That's where you'll sleep. Come!

1011
00:53:49,375 --> 00:53:54,375
Herman thinks this is
what you've been looking for.

1012
00:53:54,958 --> 00:53:56,208
You're right.

1013
00:53:56,708 --> 00:54:00,166
To be honest, Vino loves it too.

1014
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:03,541
Of course. You said you've been saving
for a long time for a dream house.

1015
00:54:03,625 --> 00:54:07,583
So you need to be 100% sure
about what you're going to buy.

1016
00:54:08,166 --> 00:54:10,791
That's more like it. Please help me out.

1017
00:54:10,875 --> 00:54:14,750
Okay, then.
Herman will negotiate with the owner.

1018
00:54:14,833 --> 00:54:17,250
Hopefully, it ends well for us.

1019
00:54:17,333 --> 00:54:18,291
See you!

1020
00:54:20,916 --> 00:54:23,083
Okay, done! I talked to him.

1021
00:54:25,333 --> 00:54:27,666
What do you mean "done"? Dim!

1022
00:54:28,375 --> 00:54:29,500
Who did you call?

1023
00:54:31,875 --> 00:54:34,625
Jon, the owner is coming to pick that up.

1024
00:54:34,708 --> 00:54:35,666
Roger that, sir.

1025
00:54:36,333 --> 00:54:38,083
- Iksan.
- Yes, sir.

1026
00:54:38,166 --> 00:54:42,166
If you use your salary
to pay the installment,

1027
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:44,125
you will receive less.

1028
00:54:44,208 --> 00:54:45,125
Is that okay?

1029
00:54:45,208 --> 00:54:46,708
It's okay, sir.

1030
00:54:46,791 --> 00:54:49,708
Thanks a lot, sir. I'll be leaving now.

1031
00:54:49,791 --> 00:54:51,791
Okay. Take care, Iksan.

1032
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,208
<i>Take care of the registration.</i>

1033
00:54:58,166 --> 00:54:59,833
I'll get more money.

1034
00:55:02,041 --> 00:55:05,041
But if you're not in school,
you're helping me at the shop.

1035
00:55:12,125 --> 00:55:15,500
Just take it, Vin.
This way you can be an actor.

1036
00:55:15,583 --> 00:55:17,708
But actors don't have
to go to film school.

1037
00:55:18,833 --> 00:55:20,333
It's for your networking.

1038
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:25,958
You work so hard to save money
to go to engineering school.

1039
00:55:26,041 --> 00:55:28,333
Why am I the one going to college now?

1040
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:38,583
Don't think too highly of me.

1041
00:55:39,458 --> 00:55:42,708
I do this for Mom, not for you.

1042
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:46,583
You're not that special.

1043
00:55:52,208 --> 00:55:53,625
What are you doing?

1044
00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:57,166
- There's an ant.
- An ant?

1045
00:56:31,708 --> 00:56:33,250
No need to do that.

1046
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,500
- Dim.
- Thank you.

1047
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,083
Thank you.

1048
00:56:44,208 --> 00:56:46,250
Sorry, we have no whiskey here.

1049
00:56:48,875 --> 00:56:50,250
Stop it.

1050
00:56:58,083 --> 00:56:58,916
I...

1051
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:04,000
- I need your help.
- You reek of cigarettes.

1052
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:10,916
It's from... I was hanging out
with some friends.

1053
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,416
Dimi told me everything.

1054
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,250
I saw your viral video too.

1055
00:57:17,791 --> 00:57:19,583
So that video is real?

1056
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:26,791
Where does this Amel girl live?

1057
00:57:26,875 --> 00:57:31,166
In Ka... I think it's Kalibatu.

1058
00:57:32,083 --> 00:57:35,500
Nunung, the girl from my shop,
grew up there. I'll ask her later.

1059
00:57:39,041 --> 00:57:40,125
But on one condition.

1060
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:41,583
What now?

1061
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:43,666
Quit smoking!

1062
00:57:47,666 --> 00:57:51,000
I don't care about your drinking
or getting drunk.

1063
00:57:51,916 --> 00:57:53,666
But please respect Mom!

1064
00:57:54,916 --> 00:57:56,708
Okay...

1065
00:58:04,583 --> 00:58:06,708
We'll go there tomorrow, with my bike.

1066
00:58:10,625 --> 00:58:11,833
Okay.

1067
00:58:15,583 --> 00:58:17,500
Who is that? Good evening!

1068
00:58:17,583 --> 00:58:19,833
- Good evening.
- Are you coming from Iksan's place?

1069
00:58:19,916 --> 00:58:20,875
Yes.

1070
00:58:21,708 --> 00:58:24,708
Right. I saw your video that went viral.

1071
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:28,875
Don't think about it too much.
Don't stress it.

1072
00:58:28,958 --> 00:58:30,583
It's just "haiters."

1073
00:58:30,666 --> 00:58:32,166
You know, "haiters."

1074
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:34,916
- Right, thank you.
- Sure.

1075
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,416
- Good luck with the patrol.
- Roger that!

1076
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,125
- Excuse me.
- Please.

1077
00:58:39,208 --> 00:58:41,250
He is a movie star, right?

1078
00:58:41,333 --> 00:58:42,750
Yes. Don't embarrass me!

1079
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:47,916
How did I get so lucky to meet
Pasha Ungu this late at night?

1080
00:58:48,416 --> 00:58:50,166
- Pasha Ungu?
- Pasha Ungu.

1081
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:53,708
You said "movie star."
Why are you talking about Pasha Ungu?

1082
00:58:53,791 --> 00:58:56,916
He's Vi... Vi...

1083
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,083
- Vicky Prasetyo!
- Stupid!

1084
00:58:59,166 --> 00:59:01,125
- Vicky Burky?
- Whatever!

1085
00:59:01,208 --> 00:59:02,125
Reza Arap?

1086
00:59:02,208 --> 00:59:03,833
That doesn't even have a "V" in it!

1087
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:07,833
Sorry, I don't get it.
He said to respect your Mom.

1088
00:59:07,916 --> 00:59:09,375
What did he mean?

1089
00:59:09,875 --> 00:59:12,750
- She died when I was in high school.
- Due to an illness, right?

1090
00:59:12,833 --> 00:59:15,083
She suffered from lung cancer.

1091
00:59:15,958 --> 00:59:18,166
She was exposed
to my dad's cigarette smoke.

1092
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:19,958
When my dad left us,

1093
00:59:20,458 --> 00:59:22,083
she fell sick.

1094
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:24,708
So are you going to quit for real?

1095
00:59:25,375 --> 00:59:26,208
We'll see.

1096
00:59:26,833 --> 00:59:27,666
What?

1097
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:48,291
- She's been a mistress three times.
- Three times?

1098
00:59:48,375 --> 00:59:49,583
- Yes.
- Let's ask them.

1099
00:59:49,666 --> 00:59:51,875
She acts innocent.

1100
00:59:51,958 --> 00:59:53,250
- Amel.
- There's no way...

1101
00:59:54,041 --> 00:59:56,208
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Yes?

1102
00:59:56,708 --> 00:59:58,458
Do you know where Amel lives?

1103
00:59:58,541 --> 01:00:00,833
Mrs. Entin's daughter, Amel?

1104
01:00:01,875 --> 01:00:03,250
Amel who's sick.

1105
01:00:06,125 --> 01:00:06,958
Is it done?

1106
01:00:08,166 --> 01:00:10,291
Oh. I'll take you there.

1107
01:00:10,375 --> 01:00:12,083
Leave the bike. I'll take you.

1108
01:00:12,166 --> 01:00:13,791
Should we take our helmets?

1109
01:00:13,875 --> 01:00:15,500
It's safe. Can you watch the bike?

1110
01:00:15,583 --> 01:00:16,541
- Sure.
- Let's go.

1111
01:00:16,625 --> 01:00:18,125
- Excuse us.
- Yes.

1112
01:00:18,208 --> 01:00:19,125
Is it far?

1113
01:00:19,208 --> 01:00:23,333
Pretty far, but you have me.
I'll take you there.

1114
01:00:23,416 --> 01:00:25,083
- Thanks.
- Is he a celebrity?

1115
01:00:26,666 --> 01:00:27,958
I think he is.

1116
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:30,250
Wait a minute.

1117
01:00:31,416 --> 01:00:32,750
Can you move aside?

1118
01:00:35,291 --> 01:00:36,833
You're a celebrity, right?

1119
01:00:37,791 --> 01:00:40,041
- No.
- See? You are.

1120
01:00:40,125 --> 01:00:42,375
I recognize your voice.
Vino Agustian, right?

1121
01:00:42,458 --> 01:00:45,000
Just take off your mask. I know you.

1122
01:00:46,916 --> 01:00:49,250
Whoa! So handsome!

1123
01:00:49,333 --> 01:00:51,791
- Can we take a selfie?
- Ma'am, where's her house?

1124
01:00:51,875 --> 01:00:54,750
- Wait. I want a selfie.
- You can take it later.

1125
01:00:55,416 --> 01:00:56,250
No...

1126
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:58,083
- Sorry.
- Oh my God.

1127
01:00:58,958 --> 01:01:00,333
My phone!

1128
01:01:00,416 --> 01:01:01,875
What happened, Mom?

1129
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:04,041
- He slapped my phone, and it fell!
- No.

1130
01:01:04,125 --> 01:01:05,250
I just wanted a selfie.

1131
01:01:05,333 --> 01:01:07,208
- What did you do to my mom?
- Look.

1132
01:01:07,291 --> 01:01:10,291
And why a selfie? Are you a celebrity?

1133
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:12,583
He's Vino Agustian, from the soap opera.

1134
01:01:13,083 --> 01:01:15,375
I've never seen him in my FYP.

1135
01:01:16,375 --> 01:01:18,708
You need to compensate us.

1136
01:01:18,791 --> 01:01:22,291
I'll pay for the repairing service.
Just show us the--

1137
01:01:22,375 --> 01:01:26,500
What service?
This is not a volleyball game!

1138
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,708
- No! You have to compensate!
- Yes.

1139
01:01:29,791 --> 01:01:30,958
- Okay.
- No.

1140
01:01:31,833 --> 01:01:33,625
- Iksan.
- You already said it.

1141
01:01:34,625 --> 01:01:36,916
Okay, then. I'll buy you a new phone.

1142
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,166
For real? You better keep your word.

1143
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:40,625
- Let me record this.
- Gosh.

1144
01:01:40,708 --> 01:01:42,958
- If you lie, it'll be viral on TikTok.
- Miss...

1145
01:01:43,041 --> 01:01:44,000
Where's Amel's house?

1146
01:01:44,083 --> 01:01:47,000
Hurry. Move aside! You're not famous!

1147
01:01:47,083 --> 01:01:48,666
- He keeps interrupting!
- Come on.

1148
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:49,625
I promise.

1149
01:01:49,708 --> 01:01:50,666
"I promise..."

1150
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:52,250
- I...
- Where's Amel's house?

1151
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
There!

1152
01:02:03,875 --> 01:02:05,666
Get well soon, Amel.

1153
01:02:08,333 --> 01:02:09,750
I'm sorry.

1154
01:02:11,958 --> 01:02:15,833
For not keeping my promise
to see you sooner.

1155
01:02:17,791 --> 01:02:20,625
I understand. Thank you.

1156
01:02:26,958 --> 01:02:28,083
Do you want a selfie?

1157
01:02:30,583 --> 01:02:33,125
I just wanted to see you.

1158
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:35,166
Thank God I still have time.

1159
01:02:49,208 --> 01:02:51,500
I have something for you.

1160
01:02:52,291 --> 01:02:54,000
I hope you like it.

1161
01:02:56,083 --> 01:02:57,458
{\an8}TO AMEL, GET WELL SOON

1162
01:02:58,041 --> 01:02:59,666
Wow!

1163
01:03:05,791 --> 01:03:09,333
Thank you for being so kind to me.

1164
01:03:10,333 --> 01:03:11,333
Amel.

1165
01:03:12,291 --> 01:03:13,875
Promise me.

1166
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:16,458
Keep up your spirit.

1167
01:03:18,541 --> 01:03:20,000
I will, Vino.

1168
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:34,083
I'm leaving now.

1169
01:03:37,916 --> 01:03:39,166
Thank you, Iksan.

1170
01:03:41,958 --> 01:03:44,291
Vino, thank you so much.

1171
01:03:44,375 --> 01:03:46,375
I'm the one who should thank you.

1172
01:03:46,916 --> 01:03:50,250
But I have to apologize.

1173
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:52,333
Apologize for what?

1174
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:54,500
For that.

1175
01:03:57,125 --> 01:04:00,500
Everyone, if you want
to take pictures with Vino,

1176
01:04:00,583 --> 01:04:02,250
the fee is five thousand rupiahs.

1177
01:04:02,333 --> 01:04:05,166
For a birthday wish video,
it's 150 thousand.

1178
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:09,208
Vino, hurry up!
They're lining up for selfies!

1179
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:10,833
Damn.

1180
01:04:13,041 --> 01:04:15,166
Are you kidding? And then?

1181
01:04:16,375 --> 01:04:19,458
What else could I do?
I just went along with it.

1182
01:04:19,541 --> 01:04:21,750
Crazy. You're like a theme park ride, huh?

1183
01:04:21,833 --> 01:04:23,333
It was no joke!

1184
01:04:25,333 --> 01:04:28,250
But how's Amel doing?

1185
01:04:31,375 --> 01:04:32,500
Poor girl.

1186
01:04:33,708 --> 01:04:35,416
They're barely holding up.

1187
01:04:35,958 --> 01:04:36,791
Poor thing.

1188
01:04:43,875 --> 01:04:49,541
VINO, LIVE AT KONGKOW BARENG TOMORROW.
THE RATING IS GOOD. (CC DIMI)

1189
01:04:51,291 --> 01:04:53,041
I don't like these kinds of shows.

1190
01:04:53,125 --> 01:04:54,833
Their gimmicks are weird.

1191
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:57,833
I think you should come.

1192
01:04:57,916 --> 01:05:00,208
Many actors
want to be promoted on that show.

1193
01:05:00,833 --> 01:05:02,250
- Should I?
- Yes.

1194
01:05:03,458 --> 01:05:04,291
OKAY, HASTO

1195
01:05:04,375 --> 01:05:06,291
But are you ready to go back to work?

1196
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:09,125
Of course I am.

1197
01:05:09,208 --> 01:05:11,708
I can't wait to get back on set.

1198
01:05:11,791 --> 01:05:12,875
Nice.

1199
01:05:12,958 --> 01:05:14,291
All good now!

1200
01:05:15,708 --> 01:05:19,291
So here's the thing, Iksan.

1201
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:22,625
I have talked with Vino.

1202
01:05:23,708 --> 01:05:28,708
The point is,
we know that Vino has great talent.

1203
01:05:29,541 --> 01:05:32,708
But such talent

1204
01:05:33,208 --> 01:05:37,041
will be a waste
without a good support system.

1205
01:05:38,041 --> 01:05:39,083
Right?

1206
01:05:43,333 --> 01:05:50,333
I've been handling actor management
for almost 20 years.

1207
01:05:50,916 --> 01:05:54,958
So my experience and my network,

1208
01:05:55,041 --> 01:05:57,625
also my connection with top producers,

1209
01:05:57,708 --> 01:06:01,291
will definitely help him
maximize his potential.

1210
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:07,291
We're the same, you and me.
We both want the best for Vino.

1211
01:06:08,875 --> 01:06:10,458
Right, Iksan?

1212
01:06:18,833 --> 01:06:19,833
Okay.

1213
01:06:20,375 --> 01:06:23,958
Hear me out. Just to be fair.
Do you like soccer?

1214
01:06:25,958 --> 01:06:31,541
In soccer, we know there is this system
called player transfer.

1215
01:06:31,625 --> 01:06:35,000
Right?
Let's say Vino is Cristiano Ronaldo,

1216
01:06:35,583 --> 01:06:41,000
and I am Manchester United,
who wants to buy him from Sporting Lisbon.

1217
01:06:42,333 --> 01:06:46,458
Does that mean that
Portugal League is bad for his career?

1218
01:06:46,541 --> 01:06:47,750
No.

1219
01:06:48,375 --> 01:06:53,083
But in the Premier League,
he will shine brighter.

1220
01:07:02,666 --> 01:07:06,208
TWO HUNDRED MILLION RUPIAHS

1221
01:07:17,083 --> 01:07:19,625
Iksan, let's talk about this first.

1222
01:07:19,708 --> 01:07:20,625
Listen first.

1223
01:07:20,708 --> 01:07:23,375
You knew his plan, and you didn't tell me.

1224
01:07:23,458 --> 01:07:24,708
It's not like that.

1225
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:28,500
I wanted you to hear it from him,
so I wouldn't say it wrong.

1226
01:07:29,375 --> 01:07:31,208
- What's with you?
- What's with me?

1227
01:07:31,291 --> 01:07:32,916
Yeah, what's with you?

1228
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,375
Why act like this
when I've got a big chance?

1229
01:07:35,875 --> 01:07:38,375
Who the heck is that guy?
What does he know about you?

1230
01:07:38,458 --> 01:07:39,708
That's not important!

1231
01:07:40,583 --> 01:07:42,666
He knows how the industry works.

1232
01:07:48,458 --> 01:07:51,375
Other actors are fighting
to be managed by him.

1233
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,541
You're the one who keeps saying
that I have talent. Right?

1234
01:07:59,083 --> 01:08:03,666
This is my chance to use my talent
so I can fly as high as possible.

1235
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,500
Iksan. Iksan.

1236
01:08:17,083 --> 01:08:18,750
If you care about me,

1237
01:08:20,083 --> 01:08:22,416
please let him take me under his wing.

1238
01:08:24,416 --> 01:08:27,416
His money can help you fulfill your dream.

1239
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:29,208
To have your own repair shop.

1240
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:37,750
This is the time.

1241
01:08:46,166 --> 01:08:47,666
Vino, give us some comments.

1242
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:49,125
After the live show.

1243
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:50,208
- Wait.
- No time.

1244
01:08:50,291 --> 01:08:51,875
- A question.
- Later. After the--

1245
01:08:51,958 --> 01:08:54,458
- Okay. Just a moment, okay?
- Yes.

1246
01:08:54,541 --> 01:08:56,791
The viral video about your bad acting,

1247
01:08:56,875 --> 01:08:58,583
where Sheila laughed at you.

1248
01:08:58,666 --> 01:08:59,958
Are you embarrassed?

1249
01:09:00,041 --> 01:09:02,958
I've said it,
it was a gimmick from the producer.

1250
01:09:03,041 --> 01:09:05,416
But many netizens don't buy it.
They think it's real.

1251
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:08,458
They can believe whatever they want.
It's their right.

1252
01:09:08,541 --> 01:09:10,333
I can't control people's opinions.

1253
01:09:10,416 --> 01:09:13,250
You looked weird in that video.
Were you on drugs?

1254
01:09:14,666 --> 01:09:16,041
Thanks, everyone.

1255
01:09:16,125 --> 01:09:17,875
- Was there a urine drug screen?
- Thanks.

1256
01:09:17,958 --> 01:09:20,166
- What's your favorite drug?
- Vino, let's go.

1257
01:09:22,041 --> 01:09:25,708
That's insane!
They really said I was on drugs.

1258
01:09:26,666 --> 01:09:29,416
- Are there a lot of comments?
- Only one account said that.

1259
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:33,083
I checked the replies.
The others still defend me.

1260
01:09:33,166 --> 01:09:35,875
Then why are you so stressed out?

1261
01:09:35,958 --> 01:09:38,625
This account pinned that comment.

1262
01:09:38,708 --> 01:09:41,875
I know. They're doing that for engagement.

1263
01:09:41,958 --> 01:09:45,958
Trust me, the one that left the comment
must be one of their fake accounts.

1264
01:09:46,875 --> 01:09:48,250
People are crazy.

1265
01:09:48,333 --> 01:09:50,583
You don't need to read that.

1266
01:09:54,125 --> 01:09:59,541
{\an8}VINO, I HAVE REJECTED ANDI'S PROPOSAL.
THE BUDGET IS TOO SMALL.

1267
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,791
See? I told you.

1268
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:06,958
Vino.

1269
01:10:07,041 --> 01:10:08,625
- Hi, miss.
- Ten more minutes.

1270
01:10:09,333 --> 01:10:10,166
- Okay?
- Okay.

1271
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:13,041
In the first segment,
we'll have some casual talk.

1272
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:15,375
We will discuss your new movie.

1273
01:10:15,458 --> 01:10:17,750
We'll do a gimmick in the second segment

1274
01:10:17,833 --> 01:10:20,250
that I'm going to explain later.

1275
01:10:21,958 --> 01:10:22,791
Okay.

1276
01:10:22,875 --> 01:10:23,833
- All good?
- All good.

1277
01:10:23,916 --> 01:10:25,708
Nice! Thanks, Vino.

1278
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:27,791
- You're welcome.
- Thanks.

1279
01:10:29,958 --> 01:10:31,916
I felt relieved, and now I'm pissed again.

1280
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,291
It's okay. Just breathe.

1281
01:10:43,291 --> 01:10:45,541
Can you breathe later?

1282
01:10:46,083 --> 01:10:47,000
What?

1283
01:10:47,666 --> 01:10:49,791
I mean, just breathe normally.

1284
01:10:51,916 --> 01:10:53,583
Thank you, sweetie.

1285
01:11:06,458 --> 01:11:08,958
Welcome back to <i>Kongkow Bareng</i>!

1286
01:11:09,041 --> 01:11:11,875
Let's just hang out!

1287
01:11:13,291 --> 01:11:16,541
Please give the loudest applause
to our special guest...

1288
01:11:16,625 --> 01:11:20,500
Vino Agustian!

1289
01:11:22,041 --> 01:11:24,125
- I'm finally invited!
- My twin!

1290
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:28,000
You're overdoing it. Relax.

1291
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:30,416
- It's normal. We are twins.
- What twins?

1292
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:31,666
We're the same.

1293
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:32,750
- How?
- Gosh.

1294
01:11:32,833 --> 01:11:34,166
We both have debts.

1295
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:35,208
We're triplets.

1296
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:36,416
PRESIDENT DIBYO'S BIOPIC

1297
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:37,458
- I am.
- You too?

1298
01:11:37,541 --> 01:11:38,708
- Let's be straight.
- Okay.

1299
01:11:38,791 --> 01:11:40,083
See you in the next episode.

1300
01:11:40,166 --> 01:11:42,416
Wait. Ask questions. We just started.

1301
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:44,250
- Just kidding. Relax.
- Okay.

1302
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:45,750
- I'm curious.
- Yes.

1303
01:11:45,833 --> 01:11:48,833
So you're going to star
in Mr. Dibyo's biopic?

1304
01:11:48,916 --> 01:11:52,625
Yes, right now,
we are still in the preparation stage,

1305
01:11:52,708 --> 01:11:54,458
still doing the reading and workshop.

1306
01:11:54,541 --> 01:11:56,916
The shooting starts next month.

1307
01:11:57,541 --> 01:11:59,791
Vino, do you feel the pressure?

1308
01:11:59,875 --> 01:12:01,708
What is the preparation?

1309
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:04,083
And how much is the production budget?

1310
01:12:04,166 --> 01:12:06,208
- Ask him one by one?
- Okay.

1311
01:12:06,291 --> 01:12:08,083
- We have time.
- All right.

1312
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:10,583
Whoa.

1313
01:12:11,625 --> 01:12:14,416
What's the... preparation?

1314
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:18,458
You're being naughty.
One question at a time. Not one word.

1315
01:12:18,541 --> 01:12:20,333
All right.

1316
01:12:20,416 --> 01:12:24,166
About Mr. Dibyo,
we can say that he's a "forpres."

1317
01:12:25,666 --> 01:12:26,750
- "Forpres."
- What?

1318
01:12:26,833 --> 01:12:29,000
- Former president.
- I see, you're abbreviating.

1319
01:12:29,083 --> 01:12:30,416
That's not wrong, right?

1320
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:31,666
- So maybe LGTTP?
- What?

1321
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:33,708
- Let's get to the point!
- Okay!

1322
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:36,833
It's a movie about a former president.

1323
01:12:36,916 --> 01:12:38,000
Yes.

1324
01:12:38,083 --> 01:12:40,166
- The budget must be high.
- Indeed.

1325
01:12:40,250 --> 01:12:43,833
The producer said it's going to be

1326
01:12:43,916 --> 01:12:47,291
the most expensive movie
in Indonesian movie history.

1327
01:12:48,083 --> 01:12:48,916
Wow.

1328
01:12:52,833 --> 01:12:54,583
Even above <i>The Avengers</i>?

1329
01:12:54,666 --> 01:12:55,583
Maybe not that far.

1330
01:12:55,666 --> 01:12:58,708
Let's compare it with local movies.
Above <i>Jurassic Park?</i>

1331
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:01,583
<i>Jurassic Park?</i> You said local movies.

1332
01:13:03,958 --> 01:13:05,666
Have you seen a dinosaur in Depok?

1333
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:07,333
- I'm dead!
- Again!

1334
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:09,666
That's how you do it!

1335
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:11,666
But why does it cost that much?

1336
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:14,250
Because this is a period movie.

1337
01:13:14,791 --> 01:13:17,625
<i>The production design
is massive and very expensive.</i>

1338
01:13:17,708 --> 01:13:22,041
<i>We need different sets
for the '60s, '70s, and '80s.</i>

1339
01:13:22,125 --> 01:13:25,333
<i>We will also do the shooting
in several cities in Indonesia.</i>

1340
01:13:25,416 --> 01:13:29,500
This movie is not only
about his political career,

1341
01:13:29,583 --> 01:13:31,083
it's also about his love story.

1342
01:13:31,166 --> 01:13:32,000
I see.

1343
01:13:32,083 --> 01:13:33,958
And also, his hobbies.

1344
01:13:34,041 --> 01:13:35,833
He likes mountain climbing, right?

1345
01:13:35,916 --> 01:13:36,750
- Right.
- Yeah.

1346
01:13:36,833 --> 01:13:39,208
You know, right?
We'll shoot it in the Himalayas.

1347
01:13:40,375 --> 01:13:42,041
- The Himalayas?
- The Himalayas.

1348
01:13:42,125 --> 01:13:43,625
In West Java?

1349
01:13:44,666 --> 01:13:47,666
That's Majalaya. Next to Bandung.

1350
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:50,166
Hang on. We'll continue after the break.

1351
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:51,708
Stay with us on <i>Kongkow Bareng!</i>

1352
01:13:51,791 --> 01:13:53,875
Let's just hang out!

1353
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:01,625
VIN, HASTO SAID YOU ARE NOT AVAILABLE.

1354
01:14:01,708 --> 01:14:04,416
I ASKED WHEN, HE HASN'T REPLIED.
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

1355
01:14:05,625 --> 01:14:06,708
Boo!

1356
01:14:07,416 --> 01:14:10,416
Next is segment two.

1357
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:14,500
We'll have the gimmick
to talk about the viral video.

1358
01:14:16,458 --> 01:14:18,208
It's simple.

1359
01:14:18,291 --> 01:14:21,250
The hosts will slightly roast you.

1360
01:14:21,333 --> 01:14:24,291
But you will get angry.

1361
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
- I will get angry?
- Yes.

1362
01:14:27,083 --> 01:14:29,416
It's just an act. You can act, right?

1363
01:14:30,416 --> 01:14:31,750
Of course.

1364
01:14:32,458 --> 01:14:34,541
- Only an act?
- Right, just an act.

1365
01:14:34,625 --> 01:14:37,625
Later, the hosts will panic and apologize.

1366
01:14:37,708 --> 01:14:39,833
And that's it. We're done.

1367
01:14:39,916 --> 01:14:43,708
It will be good
for our ratings and engagement.

1368
01:14:44,625 --> 01:14:45,750
You can act, right?

1369
01:14:47,291 --> 01:14:48,125
Okay.

1370
01:14:50,541 --> 01:14:51,625
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

1371
01:14:53,875 --> 01:14:55,458
- We're doing it?
- You can do it.

1372
01:14:56,208 --> 01:14:57,333
You're ready.

1373
01:14:59,666 --> 01:15:01,458
<i>Recently, there was a viral video</i>

1374
01:15:01,541 --> 01:15:04,333
about Vino Agustian.

1375
01:15:04,416 --> 01:15:07,458
We'll play the clip
for those who haven't seen it.

1376
01:15:07,541 --> 01:15:10,083
<i>...is only for you!</i>

1377
01:15:20,583 --> 01:15:23,750
- That's Best Actor?
- What the heck was that?

1378
01:15:27,041 --> 01:15:29,333
- Ardit!
- What is it?

1379
01:15:30,375 --> 01:15:32,541
I'm so sorry, Ardit.

1380
01:15:32,625 --> 01:15:34,000
Who are you?

1381
01:15:34,083 --> 01:15:35,041
I'm Ultraman.

1382
01:15:38,083 --> 01:15:39,625
Please stop it.

1383
01:15:39,708 --> 01:15:42,833
"Please forgive me!"

1384
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:48,125
That's not acting.
That's playing mini soccer.

1385
01:15:48,208 --> 01:15:49,666
Maybe I can do this too?

1386
01:15:54,208 --> 01:15:55,375
- There's a rumor.
- What?

1387
01:15:55,458 --> 01:15:58,916
That was a gimmick for promotion,
do you guys believe that?

1388
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,125
No!

1389
01:16:04,916 --> 01:16:10,250
I think Vino Agustian's acting skills
are starting to slip.

1390
01:16:10,333 --> 01:16:12,833
That's how it is when people are on top.

1391
01:16:12,916 --> 01:16:16,083
Some get cocky, some get arrogant.

1392
01:16:16,166 --> 01:16:17,791
Some get lost in the spotlight.

1393
01:16:17,875 --> 01:16:19,291
Is the best actor like that?

1394
01:16:19,375 --> 01:16:22,041
He better quit, and let us do it.

1395
01:16:22,125 --> 01:16:22,958
Right!

1396
01:16:23,041 --> 01:16:23,875
VINO IS ANGRY NOW

1397
01:16:23,958 --> 01:16:24,791
Let us do it!

1398
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:29,250
This's the Best Actor for you.

1399
01:16:29,333 --> 01:16:32,041
- I'd lose it if I were him.
- I know.

1400
01:16:34,708 --> 01:16:36,291
Why is he shaking, Gel?

1401
01:16:37,583 --> 01:16:38,541
Maybe it's his phone?

1402
01:16:43,333 --> 01:16:45,083
{\an8}VINO IS ANGRY NOW

1403
01:16:45,166 --> 01:16:46,708
Vino, calm down. Just breathe.

1404
01:16:49,333 --> 01:16:50,916
VINO IS ANGRY NOW

1405
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,291
You bastards!

1406
01:16:55,583 --> 01:16:57,000
You have crossed the line!

1407
01:16:58,125 --> 01:16:59,375
You jerk!

1408
01:17:00,791 --> 01:17:02,625
- I'm furious!
- Vino!

1409
01:17:02,708 --> 01:17:05,958
Can you see it? I'm so angry right now!

1410
01:17:08,208 --> 01:17:10,833
How could you do that to me?

1411
01:17:11,375 --> 01:17:12,208
Answer me!

1412
01:17:12,291 --> 01:17:13,791
- Vin, it's--
- Shut it!

1413
01:17:16,041 --> 01:17:17,875
He's definitely on drugs.

1414
01:17:19,708 --> 01:17:21,125
How dare you!

1415
01:17:21,916 --> 01:17:23,291
Damn you!

1416
01:17:23,375 --> 01:17:25,958
- Commercial break.
- I won't accept this! I'm angry!

1417
01:17:26,541 --> 01:17:28,500
- Commercial break!
- You're all making me angry!

1418
01:17:28,583 --> 01:17:31,250
- We'll be right back after the break--
- I'm angry! Furious!

1419
01:17:31,333 --> 01:17:32,833
Let's just hang out!

1420
01:17:33,791 --> 01:17:35,458
- Come at me, all of you!
- Vino! Vino!

1421
01:17:35,541 --> 01:17:37,833
Come at me! Bring it on!

1422
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:40,916
Come at me!

1423
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,083
Vino!

1424
01:17:42,166 --> 01:17:43,500
- Excuse me.
- Wait!

1425
01:17:43,583 --> 01:17:45,208
- You can't act anymore?
- Later.

1426
01:17:45,291 --> 01:17:46,166
Later, okay?

1427
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:47,375
Just one question.

1428
01:17:47,458 --> 01:17:48,333
We need to leave.

1429
01:17:48,416 --> 01:17:50,166
So you're really on drugs?

1430
01:17:50,250 --> 01:17:52,916
- Where are you going?
- Vino, answer the question first!

1431
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,416
- Vino, just one question!
- Answer it.

1432
01:18:04,041 --> 01:18:06,458
- Miss, give us a statement!
- Just a short one.

1433
01:18:06,541 --> 01:18:07,375
Oh, no...

1434
01:18:17,583 --> 01:18:18,833
You haven't eaten, right?

1435
01:18:20,833 --> 01:18:23,375
- Later.
- The noodles will get soggy.

1436
01:18:23,458 --> 01:18:25,291
I already made it. Don't waste food.

1437
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:33,541
Why don't you just turn it off?

1438
01:18:33,625 --> 01:18:35,250
I can't just ignore Hasto. If...

1439
01:18:35,333 --> 01:18:37,166
Why are you so scared of him?

1440
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:39,083
- I wonder why.
- What are you doing?

1441
01:18:40,166 --> 01:18:42,833
I want you to turn that phone off.

1442
01:18:42,916 --> 01:18:46,625
So we can focus on finding solutions.
The netizens are talking about you.

1443
01:18:46,708 --> 01:18:48,041
Then fuck them!

1444
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:49,916
I'm sick of it.

1445
01:18:50,833 --> 01:18:53,958
Can't I make a mistake?
One slip, then it goes viral.

1446
01:18:54,041 --> 01:18:55,375
That's bullshit.

1447
01:18:56,416 --> 01:19:00,333
That's the price of your fame, Vin.
You chose that.

1448
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:02,583
What do you mean?

1449
01:19:03,333 --> 01:19:04,791
That's what you want.

1450
01:19:04,875 --> 01:19:06,833
To fly as high as possible.

1451
01:19:07,458 --> 01:19:09,708
That's why you chose Hasto
as your manager.

1452
01:19:09,791 --> 01:19:11,458
This is your dream!

1453
01:19:12,333 --> 01:19:13,458
Can't you move on?

1454
01:19:13,541 --> 01:19:15,833
What do you mean?

1455
01:19:15,916 --> 01:19:19,166
This is your dream, Vin.
Accept the consequences.

1456
01:19:23,041 --> 01:19:24,375
That's so lame.

1457
01:19:25,083 --> 01:19:27,041
So you're still bitter.

1458
01:19:27,125 --> 01:19:30,208
Hey! This is not about me, Vin.

1459
01:19:30,291 --> 01:19:33,541
It's about your career!
You chose to work with a guy like Hasto!

1460
01:19:33,625 --> 01:19:35,583
What did he do wrong?

1461
01:19:38,166 --> 01:19:40,416
This is purely just business.

1462
01:19:41,166 --> 01:19:44,541
If it weren't for him,
I wouldn't be in this movie.

1463
01:19:45,666 --> 01:19:51,083
Do you know how many actors
fought for Mr. Dibyo's role?

1464
01:19:51,166 --> 01:19:53,416
- Is this movie that important?
- It is.

1465
01:19:54,458 --> 01:19:55,958
It is important to me.

1466
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
So my name will always be on top.

1467
01:20:01,166 --> 01:20:03,125
- Hasto always says--
- Stop mentioning him.

1468
01:20:03,208 --> 01:20:06,500
Do you know what's inside his head?
It's just money!

1469
01:20:06,583 --> 01:20:09,916
Fuck you! You took his money too, right?

1470
01:20:11,041 --> 01:20:12,291
Don't be a hypocrite.

1471
01:20:12,916 --> 01:20:14,083
Where's that money now?

1472
01:20:17,208 --> 01:20:18,083
Hey.

1473
01:20:21,291 --> 01:20:22,916
If you use that money right,

1474
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,833
your life won't be like this.

1475
01:20:25,916 --> 01:20:27,750
You'd do better than this.

1476
01:20:28,916 --> 01:20:32,708
Don't take it out on me
just because you failed in life.

1477
01:20:33,583 --> 01:20:35,125
It means you're bitter.

1478
01:20:40,791 --> 01:20:43,791
I gave the best years of my life for you.

1479
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:46,250
I never asked for that.

1480
01:20:59,166 --> 01:21:00,458
Iksan.

1481
01:21:03,833 --> 01:21:05,083
Yes, Mom?

1482
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:09,458
Please take care of Vino.

1483
01:21:21,458 --> 01:21:22,666
I will, Mom.

1484
01:21:23,583 --> 01:21:25,041
I promise.

1485
01:21:42,791 --> 01:21:46,916
Forgive me, Mom. Forgive me.

1486
01:21:55,750 --> 01:21:56,833
Thank you, Hasto.

1487
01:21:56,916 --> 01:21:58,458
You're welcome.

1488
01:21:58,541 --> 01:21:59,416
See you tomorrow.

1489
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:01,541
- Okay. Thank you, Gan.
- See you.

1490
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:04,041
Hi, Vin! I'm off!

1491
01:22:05,541 --> 01:22:07,541
- Vin.
- Hasto.

1492
01:22:08,125 --> 01:22:10,416
Have a seat. Just have a seat.

1493
01:22:12,041 --> 01:22:13,083
Want a drink?

1494
01:22:15,958 --> 01:22:17,416
Are you okay?

1495
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:20,000
- Me?
- Yeah.

1496
01:22:22,583 --> 01:22:23,708
Are you okay?

1497
01:22:25,458 --> 01:22:26,500
What do you mean?

1498
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,583
Well, I mean...

1499
01:22:30,666 --> 01:22:33,750
- Why are you so...
- Don't worry about me.

1500
01:22:33,833 --> 01:22:35,666
Just calm yourself. Okay?

1501
01:22:36,666 --> 01:22:38,583
What about Mr. Amir?

1502
01:22:39,541 --> 01:22:40,708
And Mr. Dibyo?

1503
01:22:42,083 --> 01:22:43,916
What about our movie?

1504
01:22:46,875 --> 01:22:48,458
Don't you know?

1505
01:22:49,333 --> 01:22:50,416
Know what?

1506
01:22:57,875 --> 01:23:00,375
<i>What do you think
about the decision, Mr. Dibyo?</i>

1507
01:23:00,458 --> 01:23:02,833
<i>Morgan is an amazing actor.</i>

1508
01:23:02,916 --> 01:23:07,541
<i>I'm thankful to Mr. Hasto
for getting Morgan to join this project.</i>

1509
01:23:07,625 --> 01:23:09,541
<i>Morgan, can you give us some comments?</i>

1510
01:23:09,625 --> 01:23:13,458
<i>I feel honored to play Mr. Dibyo.</i>

1511
01:23:13,541 --> 01:23:17,208
<i>A former president loved by the people.</i>

1512
01:23:17,291 --> 01:23:23,708
<i>And for now, I think I'm more suitable
to portray him compared to Vino.</i>

1513
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:28,625
- Hasto, it's...
<i>- Have you discussed this with Vino?</i>

1514
01:23:28,708 --> 01:23:30,666
So I've been replaced by Morgan?

1515
01:23:31,583 --> 01:23:35,166
Well, we have to save this project.

1516
01:23:35,250 --> 01:23:37,166
We still have time.

1517
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:39,458
Please, give me another chance.

1518
01:23:39,541 --> 01:23:41,333
Vin, listen to me.

1519
01:23:41,958 --> 01:23:45,916
This is a huge project. You messed it up.

1520
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,666
But I managed to sort it out.

1521
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:51,458
You know that Teh Cangkir and Starmie
dropped you as their brand ambassador?

1522
01:23:56,416 --> 01:23:58,416
Be patient. This is purely business.

1523
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:00,333
Wait...

1524
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:03,875
How could you do this so easily?

1525
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:07,291
So this is it?

1526
01:24:08,625 --> 01:24:09,458
That's all?

1527
01:24:10,791 --> 01:24:13,500
- What do you expect from me?
- To fight for me!

1528
01:24:16,416 --> 01:24:18,583
After everything I have given you,

1529
01:24:20,166 --> 01:24:22,750
you just gave it to Morgan? Wow.

1530
01:24:22,833 --> 01:24:26,041
You're a jerk! You are a damn jerk!

1531
01:24:29,750 --> 01:24:31,000
Wait.

1532
01:24:31,833 --> 01:24:32,875
Wait a sec.

1533
01:24:33,458 --> 01:24:36,500
"Everything you have given me"?

1534
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,791
From you? To me?

1535
01:24:41,458 --> 01:24:44,791
Vino! You should be grateful!

1536
01:24:44,875 --> 01:24:48,708
If it weren't for me, you'd still be
bumming with your brother. Got it?

1537
01:24:48,791 --> 01:24:51,125
Don't act like I owe you.

1538
01:24:51,208 --> 01:24:54,041
I was on set from dawn to dawn. And you?

1539
01:24:54,125 --> 01:24:56,958
Just hanging out? Chilling with the VIPs?

1540
01:24:57,041 --> 01:24:59,166
You were partying!

1541
01:24:59,250 --> 01:25:00,916
What are you going to say?

1542
01:25:03,333 --> 01:25:05,666
I don't need this shitty management.

1543
01:25:06,791 --> 01:25:08,416
I can take care of myself.

1544
01:25:09,625 --> 01:25:10,958
Fuck you.

1545
01:25:15,333 --> 01:25:17,708
You're just the same.

1546
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:22,958
You're just as stupid as your brother.

1547
01:25:23,541 --> 01:25:24,750
What do you mean?

1548
01:25:44,125 --> 01:25:45,291
Don't tell Vino.

1549
01:25:46,708 --> 01:25:49,875
I don't want him to cancel
his partnership with you.

1550
01:25:52,541 --> 01:25:55,458
No, it's... It's fair for us.

1551
01:25:55,541 --> 01:25:57,791
This is just business.

1552
01:25:57,875 --> 01:26:01,291
I consider this an investment.

1553
01:26:02,291 --> 01:26:04,166
Just accept it. I'm sincere.

1554
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:05,208
I can't.

1555
01:26:08,416 --> 01:26:12,500
It feels like... I'm selling my own brother.

1556
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:18,166
You don't need to pay me.

1557
01:26:21,208 --> 01:26:24,583
But please don't tell him
I returned this check.

1558
01:26:25,166 --> 01:26:26,750
Take care of him.

1559
01:26:26,833 --> 01:26:31,125
Please make him a successful actor.

1560
01:26:37,333 --> 01:26:38,833
All the best to you.

1561
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,000
That's Vino.

1562
01:26:58,083 --> 01:26:59,208
Vino!

1563
01:27:00,666 --> 01:27:01,875
Vino!

1564
01:27:02,875 --> 01:27:03,833
Hello?

1565
01:27:06,333 --> 01:27:07,500
All good?

1566
01:27:09,541 --> 01:27:10,958
Got a cigarette?

1567
01:27:12,041 --> 01:27:13,541
Sure!

1568
01:27:15,916 --> 01:27:17,083
Not all of them.

1569
01:27:17,750 --> 01:27:19,083
I can't let that happen.

1570
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:37,416
Now I need to buy a new lighter.

1571
01:27:45,916 --> 01:27:46,750
Vin.

1572
01:27:47,708 --> 01:27:48,875
Vin!

1573
01:27:48,958 --> 01:27:51,083
Hey! Come on.

1574
01:28:05,375 --> 01:28:06,958
He didn't finish it.

1575
01:28:10,125 --> 01:28:11,291
Ouch!

1576
01:28:12,333 --> 01:28:14,583
- Where to?
- Beats me.

1577
01:28:14,666 --> 01:28:16,750
You asked me to pick you up. Where to?

1578
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:18,125
Up to you.

1579
01:28:18,916 --> 01:28:20,833
Why did I even come here?

1580
01:28:27,708 --> 01:28:29,583
<i>You're ready to perform? Okay.</i>

1581
01:28:32,458 --> 01:28:33,416
Are you nervous?

1582
01:28:34,333 --> 01:28:35,500
Just breathe.

1583
01:28:36,583 --> 01:28:39,208
<i>Just breathe slowly. Slowly.</i>

<i>In movies, you can be

01:29:30,208 --> 01:29:32,041
This is my older brother, Iksan.

1590
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:36,250
He's also my manager.

1591
01:29:46,250 --> 01:29:49,208
<i>Don't take it out on me
just because you failed in life.</i>

1592
01:29:49,291 --> 01:29:50,666
<i>It means you're bitter.</i>

1593
01:29:54,083 --> 01:29:56,041
You've got exams soon, right?

1594
01:29:57,750 --> 01:29:59,791
Don't mess around, just focus.

1595
01:29:59,875 --> 01:30:01,375
I know, don't worry.

1596
01:30:01,458 --> 01:30:04,791
MR. YANTO'S CHICKEN SATAY

1597
01:30:07,750 --> 01:30:09,583
MR. YANTO'S CHICKEN SATAY GEN-2

1598
01:30:11,458 --> 01:30:13,791
Are you hungry or possessed?

1599
01:30:14,458 --> 01:30:15,583
Sheesh.

1600
01:30:16,625 --> 01:30:18,208
He's here.

1601
01:30:23,125 --> 01:30:24,916
- Andi.
- Hi, Vin.

1602
01:30:35,666 --> 01:30:38,000
- About your movie--
- Relax.

1603
01:30:38,875 --> 01:30:40,750
I'm not here for that.

1604
01:30:42,541 --> 01:30:44,541
Dimi said you need support.

1605
01:30:45,041 --> 01:30:48,208
So, I'm here as your friend.

1606
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:50,750
That's okay, right?

1607
01:30:53,666 --> 01:30:54,791
Thank you.

1608
01:30:57,750 --> 01:30:59,333
- I'll order some satay.
- No.

1609
01:30:59,416 --> 01:31:01,500
- Let me. Satay.
- No, thanks. I've eaten.

1610
01:31:01,583 --> 01:31:02,625
- It's good.
- I know.

1611
01:31:02,708 --> 01:31:06,416
Let's see the theater hall.
Wonder what it looks like now.

1612
01:31:08,708 --> 01:31:11,500
- Whoa.
- Wow.

1613
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,250
It's awful.

1614
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:16,333
But it has a lot of memories.

1615
01:31:16,416 --> 01:31:19,750
Like the memory of the place
where you had a crush on me?

1616
01:31:19,833 --> 01:31:23,416
- You're so annoying.
- It's okay, just admit it.

1617
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:25,333
What can I say?

1618
01:31:25,916 --> 01:31:27,583
Well, you were cute.

1619
01:31:27,666 --> 01:31:30,583
So I'm not cute now? Jerk.

1620
01:31:31,958 --> 01:31:35,333
But you have always had
a talent for acting, Vin.

1621
01:31:36,083 --> 01:31:38,458
He was a natural even as a kid.
Like Joshua!

1622
01:31:38,541 --> 01:31:39,833
You're right.

1623
01:31:40,625 --> 01:31:41,958
Dim, do you remember?

1624
01:31:42,541 --> 01:31:46,458
He used to daydream there,
pretending there was a podium.

1625
01:31:46,541 --> 01:31:48,083
Yeah, I remember that.

1626
01:31:48,166 --> 01:31:51,083
He pretended he was receiving
a Best Actor award,

1627
01:31:51,166 --> 01:31:54,625
and he gave a speech to thank everyone.

1628
01:31:55,208 --> 01:31:56,541
Hilarious.

1629
01:31:58,708 --> 01:32:01,416
- Dim, give him the trophy!
- Oh, right!

1630
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:03,041
- Can we use this?
- Yes.

1631
01:32:03,666 --> 01:32:06,125
The winner of Best Actor is...

1632
01:32:06,208 --> 01:32:09,416
Vino Agustian!

1633
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:12,166
- Give us a speech.
- Thank you.

1634
01:32:12,666 --> 01:32:13,833
The trophy is squishy.

1635
01:32:13,916 --> 01:32:16,375
- Sorry.
- And it's ripped.

1636
01:32:17,541 --> 01:32:19,791
Firstly, thank you, God.

1637
01:32:20,416 --> 01:32:22,833
Thank you to my mom in heaven.

1638
01:32:23,375 --> 01:32:27,125
Thanks to my theater friends,
you guys are the best!

1639
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:28,833
You know how to flatter us, huh?

1640
01:32:32,625 --> 01:32:35,916
And special thanks to my brother, Iksan.

1641
01:32:37,041 --> 01:32:39,208
He has done so much for me.

1642
01:32:48,208 --> 01:32:49,500
Thanks, bro.

1643
01:32:51,583 --> 01:32:52,708
I love you!

1644
01:32:54,750 --> 01:32:56,958
- Hope you win again next year!
<i>- Amen!</i>

1645
01:33:05,791 --> 01:33:07,500
- What's with him?
- I don't know.

1646
01:33:08,916 --> 01:33:10,916
- What...
- I didn't bring my car?

1647
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,958
- You didn't. I gave you a ride.
- The key! Hurry!

1648
01:33:14,041 --> 01:33:16,291
- Ask nicely!
- Dim, please, the key.

1649
01:33:16,375 --> 01:33:19,041
Okay, let's go. Let's go now.

1650
01:33:19,958 --> 01:33:21,833
Slow down, you dummy!

1651
01:33:23,958 --> 01:33:26,000
Slow down!

1652
01:33:26,083 --> 01:33:27,791
- I said, slow down!
- What?

1653
01:33:27,875 --> 01:33:29,041
- Slow down!
- You're noisy!

1654
01:33:30,916 --> 01:33:33,750
Just drop me off there.
Stop at that corner.

1655
01:33:33,833 --> 01:33:35,375
Shut it! Just jump off!

1656
01:33:35,458 --> 01:33:37,958
Drop me off here.
Vino, I'm getting off here!

1657
01:33:46,708 --> 01:33:48,625
Why am I still here?

1658
01:33:49,458 --> 01:33:52,000
Excuse us, please move aside.

1659
01:33:52,083 --> 01:33:53,500
Stop! Let us through.

1660
01:33:53,583 --> 01:33:57,083
- Vin, gosh, sorry. Be careful.
- Go! Sorry.

1661
01:33:57,166 --> 01:33:59,583
- You're so noisy.
- I'm scared. I don't wanna die.

1662
01:33:59,666 --> 01:34:02,875
Sorry, please let us through.

1663
01:34:02,958 --> 01:34:04,458
- Move, move!
- Vino!

1664
01:34:05,250 --> 01:34:08,708
- Stop. Move.
- Let us through. I'm so sorry.

1665
01:34:08,791 --> 01:34:11,833
- I'm so sorry.
- This is taking too long.

1666
01:34:17,791 --> 01:34:18,916
Why is it so dark?

1667
01:34:20,750 --> 01:34:21,583
Iksan!

1668
01:34:22,375 --> 01:34:24,125
Iksan! It's me, Vino!

1669
01:34:24,208 --> 01:34:27,041
- Maybe he's not home.
- But his bike is here.

1670
01:34:27,791 --> 01:34:30,166
Where is he? Iksan!

1671
01:34:33,083 --> 01:34:34,166
Iksan!

1672
01:34:35,041 --> 01:34:36,250
Iksan!

1673
01:34:38,875 --> 01:34:42,125
Iksan! It's me, Vino!

1674
01:34:45,291 --> 01:34:47,083
- It's not locked.
- Yeah.

1675
01:34:50,291 --> 01:34:51,291
Iksan?

1676
01:34:51,375 --> 01:34:52,625
- Wait here.
- Okay.

1677
01:34:53,416 --> 01:34:54,500
Iksan!

1678
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,041
Iksan?

1679
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,041
<i>Forgive me, Mom.</i>

1680
01:35:07,958 --> 01:35:09,458
<i>Forgive me.</i>

1681
01:35:10,750 --> 01:35:11,791
Oh my God!

1682
01:35:13,375 --> 01:35:14,458
Iksan!

1683
01:35:18,041 --> 01:35:19,125
Iksan?

1684
01:35:24,208 --> 01:35:26,583
Iksan? Iksan!

1685
01:35:26,666 --> 01:35:28,083
It's me, Vino!

1686
01:35:28,583 --> 01:35:30,541
Iksan! Iksan?

1687
01:35:33,125 --> 01:35:34,250
Iksan!

1688
01:35:37,750 --> 01:35:39,083
Iksan!

1689
01:35:47,708 --> 01:35:48,958
Fuck!

1690
01:35:51,916 --> 01:35:53,708
Iksan, what are you doing?

1691
01:35:53,791 --> 01:35:55,625
I should be the one asking you!

1692
01:35:55,708 --> 01:35:57,958
I panicked. I thought you went somewhere.

1693
01:35:58,041 --> 01:36:00,916
I'm at my own home, in my own bathroom.

1694
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,458
What's wrong with that?

1695
01:36:02,541 --> 01:36:03,875
But your house is so dark!

1696
01:36:04,958 --> 01:36:06,791
My electricity token ran out.

1697
01:36:06,875 --> 01:36:09,208
How should I know? I thought you ki--

1698
01:36:09,291 --> 01:36:11,083
- Get out.
- What happened?

1699
01:36:11,791 --> 01:36:13,375
I'm sorry, Iksan! Sorry.

1700
01:36:13,458 --> 01:36:15,625
- Why are you here?
- I heard loud noise!

1701
01:36:15,708 --> 01:36:18,416
- I thought something happened!
- He's taking a dump.

1702
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:20,791
Hey! Can you talk outside?

1703
01:36:20,875 --> 01:36:22,125
What happened here?

1704
01:36:22,625 --> 01:36:24,791
What are you two doing here?

1705
01:36:24,875 --> 01:36:27,416
We heard a loud sound on our patrol!

1706
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:29,875
We needed to check to make sure.

1707
01:36:29,958 --> 01:36:31,500
Iksan, are you constipated?

1708
01:36:31,583 --> 01:36:33,666
Do you want some papaya?

1709
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:38,375
What the heck?

1710
01:36:38,458 --> 01:36:41,000
I want to take a dump.

1711
01:36:41,083 --> 01:36:43,250
Iksan, what the heck? Stop it!

1712
01:36:47,458 --> 01:36:48,708
I'm sorry, Iksan.

1713
01:36:49,250 --> 01:36:50,250
Wait.

1714
01:36:52,916 --> 01:36:55,625
- Seriously, I'm really sorry.
- Yeah, wait.

1715
01:36:58,125 --> 01:36:59,708
Gentlemen.

1716
01:37:00,250 --> 01:37:02,875
The two of you can continue patrolling.

1717
01:37:02,958 --> 01:37:05,625
Everything is under control.

1718
01:37:07,125 --> 01:37:08,750
- Roger that!
- We'll leave now.

1719
01:37:08,833 --> 01:37:10,083
I'll put the papaya here.

1720
01:37:10,166 --> 01:37:11,625
- You don't need to.
- No worries.

1721
01:37:12,208 --> 01:37:15,041
You need that for your bowel movements.

1722
01:37:18,541 --> 01:37:20,541
Sorry for disappointing you.

1723
01:37:21,041 --> 01:37:23,666
You're too much.
Don't act sad in front of me.

1724
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:25,833
I cannot act anymore!

1725
01:37:26,875 --> 01:37:29,625
Don't remind me of that!
That makes me even sadder.

1726
01:37:29,708 --> 01:37:32,041
Hey... hey.

1727
01:37:32,125 --> 01:37:35,000
You're my brother.
Of course I will forgive you.

1728
01:37:36,125 --> 01:37:37,458
What about Hasto?

1729
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,500
We had an argument.

1730
01:37:41,166 --> 01:37:43,833
- But is he still your manager?
- Nope.

1731
01:37:44,708 --> 01:37:47,000
Are you still starring in Dibyo's movie?

1732
01:37:47,083 --> 01:37:48,041
Nope.

1733
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,208
Damn! That's tragic!

1734
01:37:51,291 --> 01:37:52,250
That's not helping.

1735
01:37:52,333 --> 01:37:54,541
I'm not helping you, I'm mocking you.

1736
01:37:54,625 --> 01:37:57,458
I know. I deserve it.

1737
01:38:02,333 --> 01:38:04,541
I really want to hug you.

1738
01:38:05,416 --> 01:38:08,583
But I feel disgusted.
Wear some clothes, will you?

1739
01:38:09,208 --> 01:38:11,833
You sprayed water on me! Come on.

1740
01:38:11,916 --> 01:38:13,500
Sorry about that.

1741
01:38:20,458 --> 01:38:21,958
Please be my manager again.

1742
01:38:25,333 --> 01:38:27,916
So you can ditch me again
when you find a new one?

1743
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,500
No, it's not like that.

1744
01:38:32,833 --> 01:38:35,625
I'm serious. I've had enough.

1745
01:38:37,750 --> 01:38:40,041
I just want things to be
the way they were.

1746
01:38:41,583 --> 01:38:43,625
Whether good or bad...

1747
01:38:45,250 --> 01:38:46,333
we do it together.

1748
01:38:46,416 --> 01:38:48,291
Yeah, yeah.

1749
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:51,208
I want you to manage me.

1750
01:38:56,041 --> 01:38:58,750
This time, I promise that

1751
01:38:59,750 --> 01:39:01,625
I will quit smoking.

1752
01:39:04,041 --> 01:39:05,875
So the other day...

1753
01:39:06,458 --> 01:39:09,125
you lied to me?

1754
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:11,458
- Too hard?
- Damn.

1755
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,375
Quite hard.

1756
01:39:16,333 --> 01:39:17,208
Does it sting?

1757
01:39:18,708 --> 01:39:20,083
- A lot.
- Sorry.

1758
01:39:20,166 --> 01:39:21,000
Okay.

1759
01:39:26,791 --> 01:39:28,125
So what do you say?

1760
01:39:30,958 --> 01:39:32,916
I can't be your manager.

1761
01:39:34,333 --> 01:39:36,375
There's someone more capable.

1762
01:39:36,958 --> 01:39:37,916
Who?

1763
01:39:41,541 --> 01:39:42,375
Me?

1764
01:39:43,208 --> 01:39:44,041
Why me?

1765
01:39:44,125 --> 01:39:45,125
Why not?

1766
01:39:45,708 --> 01:39:49,125
I'm not a people person,
and I'm bad at small talk.

1767
01:39:49,208 --> 01:39:51,250
Facing interviews. No, I can't.

1768
01:39:51,333 --> 01:39:54,000
Dim, you want to make a change.

1769
01:39:55,083 --> 01:39:58,375
I know, but I want to do it
by making documentaries.

1770
01:39:58,458 --> 01:40:00,375
Then don't bury your dreams.

1771
01:40:00,458 --> 01:40:04,583
By managing Vino, you'll have
way more networking opportunities.

1772
01:40:04,666 --> 01:40:06,333
Easier to get investors.

1773
01:40:09,333 --> 01:40:10,625
I know, but...

1774
01:40:11,208 --> 01:40:12,416
Come on, bro.

1775
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:15,666
If Iksan trusts you, I will trust you!

1776
01:40:18,208 --> 01:40:20,125
- Nice.
- I didn't say yes.

1777
01:40:20,208 --> 01:40:21,166
You didn't say no.

1778
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:22,750
- Thanks...
- What are you...

1779
01:40:22,833 --> 01:40:24,875
I just wanna say I won't let you down.

1780
01:40:24,958 --> 01:40:25,833
Disgusting.

1781
01:40:25,916 --> 01:40:27,666
But you like it, right?

1782
01:40:27,750 --> 01:40:30,583
- I'm Andi.
- Wear some clothes! Let me go!

1783
01:40:35,583 --> 01:40:36,666
What happened?

1784
01:40:41,583 --> 01:40:42,666
Fuck you!

1785
01:40:42,750 --> 01:40:44,666
Let me twist to the left!
I twisted right earlier!

1786
01:40:44,750 --> 01:40:46,125
- To balance it out.
- I'll slap you!

1787
01:40:46,708 --> 01:40:50,208
- Thanks for the electricity token.
- No worries.

1788
01:40:51,166 --> 01:40:54,250
Vin, since you're good with social media,

1789
01:40:54,333 --> 01:40:57,333
find me a house to rent
that's smaller than this.

1790
01:40:58,541 --> 01:41:01,083
What? I thought you liked this place.

1791
01:41:01,583 --> 01:41:04,416
I do, but I can't afford the rent now.

1792
01:41:05,208 --> 01:41:07,916
But I'm not asking you to pay my rent.

1793
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:11,416
You're so full of pride.
Nobody's paying your rent anyway.

1794
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:12,875
Okay, I'm leaving.

1795
01:41:12,958 --> 01:41:14,583
Replace my bathroom door.

1796
01:41:15,208 --> 01:41:16,875
I will!

1797
01:41:20,416 --> 01:41:22,958

1814
01:42:44,916 --> 01:42:47,500
Morgan Woo in <i>Dibyo!</i>

1815
01:42:48,125 --> 01:42:49,250
Congrats!

1816
01:43:21,333 --> 01:43:23,750
I finally got this trophy!

1817
01:43:26,708 --> 01:43:29,291
Vino, how does it feel to lose this time?

1818
01:43:29,375 --> 01:43:30,291
Embarrassed?

1819
01:43:30,375 --> 01:43:33,833
Honestly, I don't mind.
I'm just having fun.

1820
01:43:33,916 --> 01:43:37,583
Maybe you want to play
different characters?

1821
01:43:37,666 --> 01:43:41,208
In movies, I can be any character I want.

1822
01:43:42,041 --> 01:43:45,583
But in real life,
I need to maintain one character.

1823
01:43:48,458 --> 01:43:49,583
Right, Iksan?

1824
01:43:50,791 --> 01:43:53,333
Iksan, is it true that for Vino,

1825
01:43:53,416 --> 01:43:56,916
you refused a check
worth hundreds of millions from Hasto?

1826
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:01,708
Me? Refusing a check
worth hundreds of millions? For him?

1827
01:44:01,791 --> 01:44:03,833
That would mean I really love him.

1828
01:44:03,916 --> 01:44:06,791
But unfortunately,
I don't love him that much.

1829
01:44:07,416 --> 01:44:08,708
Nothing special.

1830
01:44:10,458 --> 01:44:12,791
Right, Vino's new manager.

1831
01:44:12,875 --> 01:44:13,958
It's Dimi.

1832
01:44:14,041 --> 01:44:15,708
- Hello.
- Hello, Dimi.

1833
01:44:15,791 --> 01:44:19,250
You can reach out to her
if he has any scandals.

1834
01:44:19,333 --> 01:44:20,833
Don't joke like that!

1835
01:44:20,916 --> 01:44:23,416
Wait, reach out to me if it's about work,

1836
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:26,041
and call the police
if he has any scandals.

1837
01:44:26,125 --> 01:44:27,541
The police, Vin.

1838
01:44:28,583 --> 01:44:29,916
Speak of the devil!

1839
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:30,833
What...

1840
01:44:30,916 --> 01:44:33,125
I am stoked with this achievement.

1841
01:44:33,208 --> 01:44:35,750
All thanks to my manager, Hasto,

1842
01:44:35,833 --> 01:44:38,958
who has trusted me
since the start of my career until...

1843
01:44:39,041 --> 01:44:40,083
Mr. Hasto?

1844
01:44:41,625 --> 01:44:42,458
Yes?

1845
01:44:42,541 --> 01:44:45,583
Hasto Juandi, Nadine's manager?

1846
01:44:45,666 --> 01:44:47,875
- Yes. Is there a problem?
- Please come with us.

1847
01:44:47,958 --> 01:44:50,083
We need your statement as a witness.

1848
01:44:50,166 --> 01:44:52,250
- Okay.
- Hasto.

1849
01:44:52,333 --> 01:44:54,166
Morgan, it's okay. Don't worry.

1850
01:44:54,250 --> 01:44:55,958
- Sir.
- What's this about, sir?

1851
01:44:56,041 --> 01:44:58,583
- Sir, wait.
- What case, sir?

1852
01:45:02,583 --> 01:45:05,708
Hasto, is it drug-related?

1853
01:45:09,750 --> 01:45:12,500
- I know this uphill road.
- Don't say anything.

1854
01:45:12,583 --> 01:45:14,000
Just be patient.

1855
01:45:14,083 --> 01:45:16,083
- Where are we going?
- Hush. This way.

1856
01:45:16,166 --> 01:45:17,125
Is it still far?

1857
01:45:18,833 --> 01:45:20,791
On the count of three, take it off.

1858
01:45:23,291 --> 01:45:26,000
One, two, three!

1859
01:45:26,083 --> 01:45:27,083
Take it off.

1860
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,666
Ta-da!

1861
01:45:33,333 --> 01:45:35,833
Surprise!

1862
01:45:37,208 --> 01:45:38,791
Relax your face.

1863
01:45:43,125 --> 01:45:46,166
Gosh. Look at you.

1864
01:45:53,125 --> 01:45:54,166
What's the surprise?

1865
01:45:54,250 --> 01:45:56,875
You didn't expect
to end up at your own shop, right?

1866
01:45:56,958 --> 01:45:58,375
You must be surprised.

1867
01:45:58,458 --> 01:46:00,333
- So the surprise is successful!
- True!

1868
01:46:02,041 --> 01:46:02,875
Ple?

1869
01:46:03,750 --> 01:46:04,625
Nung?

1870
01:46:07,166 --> 01:46:11,500
Just wait. Calm down. Look over there.

1871
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:20,083
Jon...

1872
01:46:21,458 --> 01:46:22,750
Here's the thing.

1873
01:46:23,791 --> 01:46:26,083
You don't need to say anything.

1874
01:46:26,583 --> 01:46:29,541
This is my friend, Yosep.

1875
01:46:30,583 --> 01:46:32,375
This is the guy you told me about?

1876
01:46:35,166 --> 01:46:36,875
Finally, we'll seal the deal.

1877
01:46:37,708 --> 01:46:38,791
Of course.

1878
01:46:38,875 --> 01:46:44,208
Yosep handles everything
related to notary work around this area.

1879
01:46:45,041 --> 01:46:47,250
- Notary work?
- Why are you so surprised?

1880
01:46:47,750 --> 01:46:51,208
You think people like me
can't be a notary?

1881
01:46:51,291 --> 01:46:52,125
Are you a racist?

1882
01:46:52,958 --> 01:46:57,625
I didn't mean it like that.
I didn't think that you were a notary.

1883
01:46:57,708 --> 01:47:00,500
I thought you were a bouncer.

1884
01:47:00,583 --> 01:47:04,958
Notary is my profession.
Being a bouncer? That's my passion, bro.

1885
01:47:05,875 --> 01:47:07,666
Vino, so what now?

1886
01:47:07,750 --> 01:47:10,083
- Did you bring the documents?
- Don't worry.

1887
01:47:10,166 --> 01:47:11,958
I have everything ready.

1888
01:47:13,750 --> 01:47:15,208
The agreement.

1889
01:47:16,041 --> 01:47:19,375
- Agreement for?
- Sale and Purchase.

1890
01:47:19,458 --> 01:47:21,916
You think I only know how to take things?

1891
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,625
I also know about sales.
Are you being racist again?

1892
01:47:27,708 --> 01:47:28,541
Iksan.

1893
01:47:29,375 --> 01:47:32,083
Now, this shop,

1894
01:47:32,708 --> 01:47:35,458
and this house, are yours.

1895
01:47:37,125 --> 01:47:38,583
<i>I thought you liked this place.</i>

1896
01:47:39,416 --> 01:47:42,208
I do, but I can't afford the rent now.

1897
01:47:42,916 --> 01:47:45,166
But I'm not asking you to pay my rent.

1898
01:47:45,750 --> 01:47:49,125
You're so full of pride.
Nobody's paying your rent anyway.

1899
01:47:49,208 --> 01:47:50,458
Okay, I'm leaving.

1900
01:47:50,541 --> 01:47:52,041
Replace my bathroom door.

1901
01:47:52,833 --> 01:47:54,541
I will!

1902
01:48:03,791 --> 01:48:05,375
Who are you calling?

1903
01:48:08,250 --> 01:48:11,083
- Hello, Herman.
- Hi, Vino.

1904
01:48:11,791 --> 01:48:14,958
Herman was about to call you.

1905
01:48:15,041 --> 01:48:17,083
Herman has negotiated with the owner,

1906
01:48:17,166 --> 01:48:20,750
and they agreed to lower the price.

1907
01:48:20,833 --> 01:48:22,958
Yeah. Well, about that house...

1908
01:48:24,291 --> 01:48:25,625
I think...

1909
01:48:33,583 --> 01:48:35,875
I didn't pay your rent, did I?

1910
01:48:44,708 --> 01:48:47,166
But you didn't have to buy it.

1911
01:48:47,875 --> 01:48:50,583
You didn't have to.

1912
01:48:51,125 --> 01:48:53,166
I know I didn't have to.

1913
01:48:53,250 --> 01:48:54,875
I just wanted to.

1914
01:48:56,541 --> 01:48:58,500
After everything you did for me,

1915
01:48:59,083 --> 01:49:00,458
please accept it, okay?

1916
01:49:02,166 --> 01:49:04,458
You're too much.

1917
01:49:06,416 --> 01:49:08,000
- He's crying.
- Crying.

1918
01:49:08,083 --> 01:49:09,875
- Are you crying?
- He's crying.

1919
01:49:09,958 --> 01:49:12,000
- Why are you crying?
- He's crying.

1920
01:49:12,083 --> 01:49:15,375
Look at my big brother, the crybaby!

1921
01:49:15,458 --> 01:49:17,458
You're too much.

1922
01:49:17,541 --> 01:49:19,416
Iksan! Hey!

1923
01:49:20,208 --> 01:49:22,208
Where are you going? Come here.

1924
01:49:27,125 --> 01:49:28,583
Iksan, stop crying.

1925
01:49:38,750 --> 01:49:41,541
No! Don't smooch me!

1926
01:49:45,958 --> 01:49:47,166
Should we join them?

1927
01:49:47,875 --> 01:49:51,041
We shouldn't. We're just outsiders.

1928
01:49:51,125 --> 01:49:53,708
But this is a very beautiful moment.

1929
01:49:53,791 --> 01:49:54,666
Come on.

1930
01:49:55,500 --> 01:49:56,333
Okay, come on.

1931
01:50:02,708 --> 01:50:03,541
Jon.

1932
01:50:04,958 --> 01:50:06,041
What are you doing?

1933
01:50:09,291 --> 01:50:12,250
See? I told you. We shouldn't have.

1934
01:50:12,333 --> 01:50:15,000
I know. But what about the agreement?

1935
01:50:15,083 --> 01:50:18,000
Let's come back later. It's embarrassing.

1936
01:50:23,375 --> 01:50:25,000
What are they celebrating?

1937
01:50:25,083 --> 01:50:26,958
It must be the New Year!

1938
01:50:27,041 --> 01:50:28,916
- Is that so?
- Of course!

1939
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:30,375
Have you got a trumpet?

1940
01:50:30,458 --> 01:50:33,458
I haven't. Let's buy some trumpets.

1941
01:50:33,541 --> 01:50:35,541
- Get a singer too!
- You're right!

1942
01:50:36,333 --> 01:50:39,000
But Independence Day was not long ago.

1943
01:50:39,083 --> 01:50:42,625
So now we celebrate New Year in September!

1944
01:50:42,708 --> 01:50:45,083
Right! We can celebrate sooner! Come on!

1945
01:54:31,333 --> 01:54:33,250

3
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:30,291
Come, Stephen.

4
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:33,916
- Come on in.
- Stephen. Get in, my boy.

5
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,250
Why are you hesitating? Come.

6
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:39,791
Don't be afraid. Get in.

7
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:41,916
Don't overthink.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,958
Dad is here for you.

9
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:46,541
Listen to your mom. Come on.

10
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:48,666
Come and climb up.

11
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:50,333
Come on, Stephen.

12
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:55,916
- Good.
- Good. Get in.

13
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:57,916
Good.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,375
Come, come, come.

15
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:10,833
What, Stephen? Are you feeling dizzy?

16
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:21,583
What are you going to do there?

17
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:23,250
I won't do anything.

18
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,708
Better stay here then?

19
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:26,125
Please, sweetheart.

20
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:28,958
Hey! Stop with your "sweetheart" bullshit.

21
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:31,458
Will I ever lie to you?

22
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:33,208
Then tell the truth!

23
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:35,875
That you want to rat me out to the police.
I'll let you go.

24
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:39,166
I didn't even think about the police.

25
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,666
Hey. I'll let you go if you accept it.

26
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,916
I swear, I won't.

27
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:46,916
Accept it and I'll let you go.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,458
Please, dear. Please.

29
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:52,291
You're delaying unnecessarily.

30
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:55,833
So, if I accept it, will you let me go?

31
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,666
Yes. Accept it, and I'll let you go.

32
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:00,666
Well, yes. I'm going to the police.

33
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,208
I am going to tell them
everything about you.

34
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:08,916
Okay. Nice, nice, nice.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,375
So, now for the next step...

36
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,583
What next?
Escaping from him, right?

37
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:15,916
Why would you say that?

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,666
Well, sir,
how can you live with such a person?

39
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:20,208
{\an8}Such a person?

40
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:21,625
{\an8}A psycho.

41
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:25,000
{\an8}Psycho? Isn't that a bit harsh?

42
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:28,708
{\an8}What should I call him then?

43
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:29,875
{\an8}An innocent boy?

44
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:33,041
Okay. Calm down.

45
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:35,333
You are right.

46
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:37,125
Seems like he's a proper lunatic.

47
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,833
Now he is very angry.

48
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:45,125
Out of anger, he grabs a knife
and comes to stab you.

49
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,791
For now, as a cue,
imagine I'm the killer.

50
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:51,000
You role is to scream in fear.

51
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,458
Okay? Can you do that?

52
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:53,375
Yeah. Okay.

53
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:54,458
Ready?

54
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,708
I feel the dialogues are out of place.

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,500
What makes you say so?

56
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:03,833
Well,

57
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:06,250
I know him from my childhood.

58
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,333
And I'm in love with him too.

59
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:12,083
Then, how could I betray him
and hand him over to the police suddenly?

60
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:15,583
Okay. You start.

61
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:20,333
Action.

62
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,625
Hey, I'm running toward you with a knife.

63
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,333
- Is this how you scream?
- Sir. Sorry, sir.

64
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,166
- Imagine this is your life's last second.
- I get it.

65
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,625
Feel the intensity, and scream.

66
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,208
- Want to be a heroine or not?
- I do.

67
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:35,166
- Yes?
- Yes.

68
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,000
Then you should act like one. Okay?

69
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:37,916
Yeah. Okay.

70
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:40,541
Action.

71
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,250
Sorry, sir. Sorry.

72
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,875
- No, no. I'll wait. You cough.
- Sorry, sir.

73
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:47,791
What is this?

74
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,166
Sorry, sir.

75
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,541
You know what?
I will grab a real knife.

76
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,000
Only then you will feel the intensity.

77
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:53,916
Okay, sir.

78
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:03,333
Last take. I can't take it anymore.

79
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:06,541
Done.

80
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,416
- Ready?
- Yes, ready.

81
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,375
What's your name again?

82
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,625
Simran.

83
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:21,625
Simran. Nice. Nice name.

84
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,916
Okay, let's go.

85
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,208
Action.

86
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,541
Yes, sir.

87
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:21,791
<i>What's going on?</i>

88
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:24,583
The sketch has been sent
to every check post, sir.

89
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,416
We'll catch him before nightfall.

90
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,000
<i>The public should not know
about this. Finish it soon.</i>

91
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:29,958
Definitely, sir.

92
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:30,875
<i>Keep me posted.</i>

93
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:31,791
Sure.

94
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,333
Constable, bring that over.

95
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,125
<i>News flash!</i>

96
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:52,708
<i>Per the information from the initial probe
of the missing women's case,</i>

97
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:55,541
<i>the killer's face has been sketched out.</i>

98
00:05:55,625 --> 00:06:02,208
<i>Regarding this, #KillerOnTheLoose
is trending on social media.</i>

99
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:07,000
<i>The public has been advised
to stay vigilant.</i>

100
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,000
Let's check Puliyakulam Road, too, sir.

101
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,083
Are you sure?
Is it the same car?

102
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,166
Sorry.

103
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,958
<i>Sir, the car has made
a turn near Sowripalayam. Over.</i>

104
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,250
- Have you seen this man?
- Yes, sir.

105
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,083
If you go straight here,
it's the last house.

106
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,083
- I saw him go that way this morning.
- Sir!

107
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,166
Get in quickly.

108
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,083
Madhu, let's go.

109
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:01,541
Brother!

110
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:10,750
Sir...

111
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:13,708
We found him.

112
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:18,708
What do you want?

113
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:20,583
Won't talk unless I ask?

114
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:26,750
{\an8}I'm a killer, sir.

115
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:29,708
Oh, that's great.

116
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:33,583
Who? Where? When?

117
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:39,250
Seems like you forgot who you killed, boy.

118
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,833
I'm not sure what
these guys are drinking nowadays, sir.

119
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,625
What's up, man? Smoked a joint?

120
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:48,041
He must have.
Can I get you some tea?

121
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,041
Let's drink and talk clearly.

122
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,875
I killed nine girls, sir.

123
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,708
I'm the one you are searching for.

124
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,541
Okay, sir. Okay.

125
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,541
It's confirmed.
The sketch matches perfectly.

126
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:21,125
SP and Commissioner are on their way.

127
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,416
We have to watch him, until they come.

128
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,208
I won't run away, sir.

129
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,541
Take your time.

130
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:44,875
Sir?

131
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,291
Instead of tea,
can I get a cup of coffee?

132
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:15,875
We've caught the main culprit
responsible for the nine missing girls.

133
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:16,875
We want justice!

134
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,541
<i>His name is Stephen.</i>

135
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:21,750
<i>He has been taken into custody
and is under investigation.</i>

136
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:24,208
<i>We will proceed to court
as fast as we can.</i>

137
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,375
Stop, stop. Wait.

138
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,875
<i>We just caught him.
Give us some time.</i>

139
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,625
<i>We are going step by step.
We'll let you know the details.</i>

140
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,125
A case officer has already been assigned.

141
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,291
<i>Motive and MO will be found soon.</i>

142
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:40,208
{\an8}- We will fight...
- Until justice is served.

143
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:51,083
And we need your cooperation
until this case is closed. Thank you.

144
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,541
{\an8}<i>How is the government responsible
if a maniac goes on a killing spree?</i>

145
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,208
{\an8}<i>Court and police are acting fast.</i>

146
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:02,000
{\an8}<i>CM is actively looking for a way
to hang Stephen by all means.</i>

147
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,583
What have you done?

148
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:09,000
You had a clear instruction to shoot him
on sight. Not to let him surrender.

149
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,291
No, sir.

150
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:14,000
Before we could trace his house,
he surrendered at B2 station, sir.

151
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:18,333
<i>It feels unsafe to live in a city
where this psycho has been hiding.</i>

152
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:21,083
<i>If you can't do anything legally,
leave it to the public.</i>

153
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,375
<i>We know how to handle him.</i>

154
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,375
<i>People like him should be shot in public.</i>

155
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,291
{\an8}<i>What he did is unforgivable.</i>

156
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:29,208
Hang him! Hang him! Hang him!

157
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,958
The outrage from the public is extreme.

158
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:33,500
<i>Nine girls, Michael!</i>

159
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:37,166
<i>No human has the right
to take another human's life.</i>

160
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,083
<i>But I don't know if he is even a human.</i>

161
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,041
<i>The court must hang him for sure.</i>

162
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,375
Do something and finish this off.

163
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,708
<i>Officially, this case is over.</i>

164
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:55,166
<i>There's nothing more I can do
in this case, as a police.</i>

165
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,333
<i>The killer has surrendered.</i>

166
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:02,333
<i>It's enough if I submit
the evidences to the court.</i>

167
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,500
<i>He'll be hanged for sure.</i>

168
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,000
<i>But will I get the answer?</i>

169
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,041
<i>Why did he surrender himself?</i>

170
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,500
<i>Six months and nine girls.</i>

171
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,166
<i>He could've surrendered
anytime before, too.</i>

172
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,208
<i>But why now?</i>

173
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:26,916
<i>Did he get scared?
Or is this a plan, Stephen?</i>

174
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,500
I killed Smitha like this.

175
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,458
Excuse me.

176
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:50,791
I took Riya's life... this way.

177
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:56,041
If I couldn't dispose of the bodies
immediately, I'll pile them up here.

178
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,041
Hey, how did you dispose of those bodies?

179
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:07,083
I'll take them to the forest
and throw them.

180
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:08,833
And then?

181
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:10,208
I'll come back.

182
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:11,750
What do you mean?

183
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,666
Yeah. I'll go and check the next day.

184
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,916
The bodies would've disappeared.

185
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,666
I don't know what happened to them.

186
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,541
Where is that forest?

187
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:27,000
Velu, search carefully.
Don't leave anything out.

188
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:33,000
Carefully. On that side too.
Pandi, come and search here.

189
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,666
Ranga, please come over here.
Search on this side.

190
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,916
Don't leave anything out.
Search carefully.

191
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,750
- Velu, look, there's something--
- Sir!

192
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,833
Stephen Jebaraj...

193
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,791
You've declared you don't need a lawyer.
Is that right?

194
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,041
Nodding is not enough. Open your mouth.

195
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:14,458
Yes, sir.

196
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:15,458
Why?

197
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,333
Not needed, sir.

198
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,666
For the record, your charges
will be read out now. Listen closely.

199
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,583
Okay, sir.

200
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:29,000
Between April 2023 to December 2023,

201
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:32,750
Ramya, Prema, Janu,
Preethi, Vijayalakshmi, Riya,

202
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,333
Smitha, Simran, and Surekha

203
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:37,916
were the nine victims who were kidnapped
and murdered by the accused.

204
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,083
That's enough.

205
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,541
Do you accept these charges?

206
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:44,958
I accept.

207
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:46,500
Who's the investigating officer?

208
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:47,416
Sir.

209
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:52,333
What will you do if he says he wasn't
in the right mind while confessing?

210
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:56,958
Procure proper examination reports
in 15 days' time.

211
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,958
Most importantly,
mental examination should be precise.

212
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,125
Okay, sir.

213
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:02,875
He looks abnormal as well.

214
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,750
Do you know the profile
of this case outside?

215
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,500
You seem to be very careless.

216
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:09,916
Is this a petty theft case?

217
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,208
Serial killings.

218
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:14,416
In my years of service, I have never dealt
with a nine-murder case.

219
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:16,958
You may leave now.

220
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:22,208
The accused has to be brought
in the same condition.

221
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:41,750
No, no, no.

222
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,916
Hey, hold him.

223
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,541
Burn in hell, psycho!

224
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,500
Hold him. Hold him.

225
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,750
I'll not rest until I kill you!

226
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:06,083
What did my little sister do
to deserve this horrible fate, you coward?

227
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,875
Stephen!

228
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,875
Hey, hey, careful.

229
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,041
Come here, Kuttan.

230
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:32,625
Super!

231
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,666
Stephen!

232
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,875
Come, let's go.

233
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:39,583
You said you will give away
the puppy to your friend, right?

234
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,041
What happened?

235
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,666
Mom, he'll grow up in one year.

236
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:48,250
And then he'll easily save
both of us from Dad.

237
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,666
Hey, Stephen!

238
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:53,583
<i>Dad.</i>

239
00:18:54,541 --> 00:19:00,416
<i>Despite his ability, he couldn't survive
in athletics due to continuous injuries.</i>

240
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:04,041
<i>He could only become
my school's sports teacher.</i>

241
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:07,708
<i>Out of frustration, he started drinking.</i>

242
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,208
<i>He'll drink every day.</i>

243
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:15,125
<i>He'll also torture me
to become a great player.</i>

244
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:18,000
Next, plank, 30 seconds.

245
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,625
Hey, bring me the damn omelet!

246
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,625
Bring it right now, you fool!

247
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,500
You useless piece of...

248
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:33,500
<i>If my situation is worst,
just imagine my mom's.</i>

249
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,750
My teaching form is incorrect it seems.

250
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,958
Says that amateur piece of crap.

251
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:45,125
Along with him,
that wine shop brat as well.

252
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:48,750
Apparently, the management has imposed
no-liquor policy during school hours.

253
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,166
I had to go to another liquor store today.
Crappy loafers.

254
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,583
Who are you guys to order me?

255
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,875
I will drink. This is my house.

256
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:00,166
All right, my father-in-law's house.

257
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,958
<i>Me and my mom
were used to tolerating my dad.</i>

258
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:06,416
<i>But Kuttan...</i>

259
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,083
Where have you kept Kuttan?

260
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,916
He's in the upstairs room, Mom.

261
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,791
If Dad finds out, we are done.

262
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,375
I told you this is risky.
Why can't you listen?

263
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:28,375
Stephen!

264
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:31,833
Stephen!

265
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,458
Where are you?

266
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:41,625
What's this?

267
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:48,375
Who gave permission to keep
this good-for-nothing in the house?

268
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,041
Tell me, good-for-nothing no. 1.

269
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,416
Stop crying, good-for-nothing no. 2.
Open your mouth!

270
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,208
Please, Dad.
Please leave Kuttan alone. I beg you.

271
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,791
Answer me, madam.

272
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,833
Shut up, good-for-nothing no. 3.

273
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:09,583
Use your mouth and talk.

274
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,750
Hey, I'm talking to you!

275
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,791
I said, open your...

276
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:16,666
Mom...

277
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,375
Kuttan... Kuttan! Kuttan!

278
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,208
Kuttan!

279
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Hey, stop it.

280
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:36,625
How dare it pee on me!

281
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:40,083
Hey, clean up the mess quickly.

282
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,833
Or it might infect us!

283
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:45,416
What are these papers for, madam?
Yesterday went well, right?

284
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,500
I have to conduct a few tests, Stephen.
For assessment purposes.

285
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:52,458
When I came over just now,
the weather was good outside.

286
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,125
I thought today would be a good day.

287
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,416
But now, it's ruined for sure.

288
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:58,916
There's no pass or fail in these tests.

289
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:03,916
What does this image make you think of?

290
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:07,041
Should I definitely answer?

291
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:08,708
You can tell me whatever you think of.

292
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:12,166
It... looks like a demon.

293
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:17,541
A demon who plans to invade
and destroy the world we live in.

294
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:21,583
Do you see the sharp horns on his head?

295
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:25,166
And then, this looks like his chariot.

296
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:30,583
Interesting.

297
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:35,666
What do you think of this?

298
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,583
It resembles a girl's private parts.

299
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,750
Okay.

300
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:44,958
And this?

301
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:47,000
One minute.

302
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:50,083
What are you going to do with my answers?

303
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:53,208
You want to know your result
even before you attend the exam?

304
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:55,875
But you told me
there's no pass or fail, right?

305
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,208
Everything is for an assessment, Stephen.

306
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:01,500
Here. Next is IQ and personality tests.

307
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:04,333
You'll understand
when you see the questions.

308
00:24:04,416 --> 00:24:05,666
Can I give random answers then?

309
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:07,500
Definitely not.

310
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:09,791
Answer with honesty.

311
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,750
At the end of the day,
hope all of this is useful to you.

312
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:25,916
Okay. Let's begin
where we stopped yesterday.

313
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,958
So, your dad is a drunkard,

314
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:31,541
which is a problem
for you and your mother.

315
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:34,875
My dad was the starting point
for everything.

316
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:38,541
But he was not the end point.

317
00:24:49,708 --> 00:24:52,250
Sister, where is room number 305?

318
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:54,500
Go straight and take a left, ma'am.
Last room.

319
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:57,291
Hey! Are you that man's wife?

320
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,500
He recorded and posted an explicit video
of the SI's daughter on the web.

321
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:02,708
Poor girl, she tried taking her own life.

322
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:05,041
They spared his life with
just a broken hip, because she survived.

323
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:06,958
Tell him to stay safe indoors.

324
00:25:07,916 --> 00:25:09,833
Or else...

325
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:19,625
Can't you come sooner?

326
00:25:21,791 --> 00:25:23,333
It's hurting a lot.

327
00:25:25,833 --> 00:25:27,541
Why are you looking at me like that?

328
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:29,875
I wasn't sober.

329
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,458
Forget this ever happened.

330
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,458
Seems like it'll take six months
for me to walk again.

331
00:25:38,708 --> 00:25:41,291
You better call your dad
and ask for money till then.

332
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,083
Hey. I'm talking to you.

333
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:45,500
Can't you open your mouth?

334
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,500
- Filthy dog!
- It hurts.

335
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:52,916
- Filthy dog! How dare you ask for more.
- Don't hit. I'll kill you.

336
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:56,541
That poor girl's life
has gone to dust now.

337
00:25:56,625 --> 00:25:58,333
You arrogant pervert.

338
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:01,833
Aren't you ashamed?

339
00:26:02,958 --> 00:26:05,458
How can I even show my face outside?

340
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:08,166
You filthy dog!

341
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:18,666
<i>My mom, who was suffering
from my dad's abuse till then,</i>

342
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:21,416
<i>finally got an opportunity.</i>

343
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:27,791
<i>She resumed her baking business, which
she had stopped out of fear of my dad.</i>

344
00:26:44,916 --> 00:26:48,416
<i>She took control of the whole house.</i>

345
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:50,833
<i>Including Dad.</i>

346
00:27:02,541 --> 00:27:05,666
{\an8}<i>I don't know what mistake I made.</i>

347
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,375
<i>She suppressed and oppressed me too.</i>

348
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:13,416
<i>Mom had her own reasons.</i>

349
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:19,208
<i>From the outside,
it seemed like an ordinary house.</i>

350
00:27:20,458 --> 00:27:22,833
<i>But only we knew</i>

351
00:27:22,916 --> 00:27:24,875
<i>that this is her kingdom.</i>

352
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:30,500
Seems like there's no one at home.

353
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,583
Let's see.

354
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:42,833
Mm... Guest.

355
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:06,291
- Hey. Hi, Mithun!
- Hello, Aunty.

356
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:08,083
Sorry, I was busy with household work.

357
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:10,500
Come in. Come in, dear.

358
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,583
Please come in.

359
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:51,083
Hello, Police Officer.

360
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:52,500
Hello.

361
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:57,625
I feel like Stephen is hiding something.

362
00:28:58,416 --> 00:28:59,666
Why do you say so?

363
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,666
We gave him a Rorschach test.

364
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,708
Sorry?

365
00:29:02,791 --> 00:29:05,708
Basically, we'll show few images
to our patients.

366
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:07,833
Wait. I'll give you a demo.

367
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:11,791
What do you think of this image?

368
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:15,666
Looks like a chicken hanging upside down.

369
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,375
It's normal when the answer is like yours.

370
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:21,625
But he described it as a demon,
coming to destroy the world.

371
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:23,166
- That's abnormal.
- Why,

372
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:26,250
didn't you know that already
when he killed nine girls?

373
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:28,875
Me and my team conducted
a few tests for Stephen

374
00:29:28,958 --> 00:29:32,666
to check if he has psychopathic deviations
and personality disorders.

375
00:29:33,541 --> 00:29:35,416
The test says
he's a pathological liar.

376
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:39,250
It's usual for killers to lie, right?

377
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:40,958
There is a thing called lie score limit.

378
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:44,500
It helps with calculating
the extent of the lies.

379
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:47,041
For example, I'm giving you 100 questions.

380
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:49,916
In that, I would have asked
something as the 22nd question.

381
00:29:50,833 --> 00:29:54,041
The same question
will be modified as the 69th question.

382
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:58,000
If there is variation in the two answers
for the same question, it's an indication.

383
00:29:58,833 --> 00:30:02,541
If the lie score exceeds the limit, such
answers will not be taken into account.

384
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:06,583
Our guy was beyond
the limit of the lie score.

385
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:10,041
So you mean, the tests are inconclusive.

386
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:11,791
Not like that.

387
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:16,291
The Rorschach test says
that Stephen is still a violent person.

388
00:30:17,208 --> 00:30:22,166
But his body language
and his demeanor tells a different story.

389
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:26,666
<i>What if the girls he claimed
to have killed are still alive?</i>

390
00:30:28,833 --> 00:30:32,666
Now, he's slowly starting
to open up about his parents.

391
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:35,583
{\an8}Hey, do you even know
that his parents are not alive?

392
00:30:37,291 --> 00:30:38,250
{\an8}Yes, I know.

393
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:41,083
{\an8}Officially, there is
a police case against his dad.

394
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:44,000
{\an8}That he killed his wife
and then took his own life.

395
00:30:45,416 --> 00:30:47,875
{\an8}But can you collect
additional information?

396
00:30:47,958 --> 00:30:50,000
Only then, I will get more clarity.

397
00:30:52,583 --> 00:30:55,583
<i>What if Seema is right
about Stephen's lies?</i>

398
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:58,625
<i>What if he has lied to me all this time?</i>

399
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:02,583
<i>I should meet the characters
of his story in person.</i>

400
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:05,833
<i>Only then, the truth will come out.</i>

401
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:08,083
<i>What are you planning, Stephen?</i>

402
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:11,208
<i>I'll find out soon.</i>

403
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,791
- Brother.
- Sir.

404
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:19,791
Is Moorthy Sir not here?

405
00:31:19,875 --> 00:31:21,291
No, sir.

406
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:24,000
He's off duty for two days
for his daughter's marriage.

407
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:25,958
<i>Okay. Let him know that I asked for him.</i>

408
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:34,125
<i>Any news about my daughter?</i>

409
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:36,750
Not yet, madam.
Please be patient for some more time.

410
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,750
<i>He has slowly started to open himself up.</i>

411
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:45,791
He might stop answering
if I put him under pressure.

412
00:31:47,708 --> 00:31:50,916
Our daughter was our entire world.

413
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:54,875
<i>How can a human be this cruel?</i>

414
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,833
There are many good people in this world.

415
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,375
They do good deeds
without expecting anything in return.

416
00:32:01,625 --> 00:32:04,708
And there are some people like Stephen,

417
00:32:04,791 --> 00:32:08,083
<i>who commit such cruelty
for no reason at all.</i>

418
00:32:08,166 --> 00:32:10,541
Please be brave.

419
00:32:11,916 --> 00:32:16,500
If we don't get justice
for my daughter and the other victims,

420
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:20,125
I'll beat that animal to death myself.

421
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:25,083
What do you think
of Stephen's parents?

422
00:32:25,166 --> 00:32:26,958
Sir, they're really nice people.

423
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:29,958
They were very helpful and silent too.

424
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:33,416
His dad wasn't a good man, sir.
He was a problematic drunkard.

425
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,500
Your opinion about Stephen?

426
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:37,291
Sir, he wouldn't come out much.
Very strict family.

427
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,291
Sir, his dad was always at home.

428
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:47,916
Only Stephen would come to the store.

429
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,500
His mom wasn't that good, sir.

430
00:32:49,583 --> 00:32:51,708
She'd be roaming at odd hours
for her baking business.

431
00:32:51,791 --> 00:32:54,916
Stephen doesn't even drink or smoke, sir.
A very decent boy.

432
00:33:07,541 --> 00:33:09,250
Bro, one tea.

433
00:33:11,791 --> 00:33:13,291
Mithun?

434
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:15,208
How are you and Stephen related?

435
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Stephen was my classmate, sir.

436
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:20,291
We sat in the same bench
from school to college.

437
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:22,333
He wouldn't mingle with anyone.

438
00:33:22,416 --> 00:33:24,791
But he opened up to me freely, in a way.

439
00:33:24,875 --> 00:33:26,291
I think you would have heard the news.

440
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:28,958
I did, sir.

441
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:31,958
I did not expect
him to do such things.

442
00:33:32,041 --> 00:33:34,625
What can I say,
blame it on his upbringing?

443
00:33:36,958 --> 00:33:38,125
Elaborate.

444
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:42,083
I don't know
what to think about his parents.

445
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:46,000
One day, in our childhood...

446
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:51,000
Trust me, dude.
She's beating me a lot nowadays.

447
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:55,166
Don't lie.
You always say the same thing.

448
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,791
Your mom is a very good woman.

449
00:33:57,875 --> 00:33:59,833
She always gives me cake, you know?

450
00:34:12,291 --> 00:34:13,958
I can give you the cakes myself.

451
00:34:14,041 --> 00:34:15,166
But please trust me.

452
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,333
Stephen!

453
00:34:17,416 --> 00:34:18,250
Oh, no...

454
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:23,833
- Mom?
- Come here.

455
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:28,791
Did you serve coffee to Dad?

456
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:30,625
Of course, Mom.

457
00:34:30,708 --> 00:34:32,416
Did you mix the pill in it?

458
00:34:33,583 --> 00:34:34,708
Pill?

459
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:35,833
Mithun!

460
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:38,041
Aunty?

461
00:34:38,125 --> 00:34:40,333
It's quite late.
Can you come back tomorrow?

462
00:34:40,416 --> 00:34:41,583
Okay, Aunty.

463
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:47,416
Aunty, I love your plum cakes.
Can you bake them again for me?

464
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,458
Why not?
I'll bake them for Christmas.

465
00:34:50,541 --> 00:34:53,875
And if anyone else asks for cakes,
let me know! Okay?

466
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:55,250
- Sure, Aunty.
- Okay.

467
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:56,583
Bye, Stephen.

468
00:34:59,208 --> 00:35:03,458
You didn't do the only job given to you.
Too busy playing video games?

469
00:35:03,541 --> 00:35:04,458
No, Mom.

470
00:35:04,541 --> 00:35:08,000
Don't you know the pill has to be put
in Dad's coffee? Don't you know?

471
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:10,458
- Don't you?
- Sorry, Mom. I totally forgot.

472
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:12,750
- Nowadays, you don't listen to me at all.
- Sorry, Mom.

473
00:35:12,833 --> 00:35:13,666
Aunty.

474
00:35:14,916 --> 00:35:17,416
I forgot my game CD.

475
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,916
Stephen, go and get it.

476
00:35:31,541 --> 00:35:32,708
Go home safely, okay?

477
00:35:36,041 --> 00:35:37,833
He has told me a lot, sir.

478
00:35:37,916 --> 00:35:41,125
His dad's misbehavior
and how his mom beats him up.

479
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:48,500
Something was definitely wrong there, sir.
I could sense it.

480
00:35:50,875 --> 00:35:53,500
No one really knows much about them, sir.

481
00:35:53,583 --> 00:35:55,791
Stephen was the one
caught up in this mess.

482
00:35:57,208 --> 00:35:58,916
How is he holding up, sir?

483
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:00,916
Sir?

484
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,875
<i>Who are you really, Stephen?</i>

485
00:36:13,375 --> 00:36:14,333
Michael!

486
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:18,416
Moorthy Sir. What a surprise.

487
00:36:19,041 --> 00:36:20,375
My daughter is getting married.

488
00:36:20,458 --> 00:36:22,333
This school's principal
is my family friend.

489
00:36:22,416 --> 00:36:24,750
I came to invite him for the wedding.

490
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:27,208
I came to your station
in the morning, sir.

491
00:36:27,291 --> 00:36:30,500
You were the one who closed
Stephen's parents' case, right?

492
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:32,500
I need some details regarding it.

493
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:35,500
Because Stephen's dad worked here.

494
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:37,708
He recorded explicit videos
of many female students.

495
00:36:37,791 --> 00:36:41,000
The affected people
seemed to have beaten him.

496
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:43,541
But no case has been filed.
That's why...

497
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:44,500
Okay, carry on.

498
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:46,416
I'll meet you at the station later.

499
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:49,666
Moorthy Sir?

500
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,625
Even your daughter studied here, right?

501
00:36:58,166 --> 00:36:59,000
Michael.

502
00:36:59,666 --> 00:37:02,041
I was rechecking the evidence.

503
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:05,291
I noticed a wristband
which was retrieved from Stephen's house.

504
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:07,500
Regarding Christianity.

505
00:37:07,583 --> 00:37:11,083
I think no one has looked into it.
Can you please...

506
00:37:11,166 --> 00:37:13,500
Hey. What are you thinking?

507
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:26,500
Sir... regarding Stephen's parents' death,

508
00:37:26,583 --> 00:37:29,416
how did you close the case
without any conclusive evidence?

509
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:33,208
I did everything for my daughter's sake.

510
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:37,333
Stephen's dad didn't commit suicide, sir.

511
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:41,375
Stephen killed him.

512
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,666
It was New Year's Eve.
A call came from the control room.

513
00:37:50,541 --> 00:37:53,750
Everyone was out on duty.
So I attended the call.

514
00:37:53,833 --> 00:37:57,416
Someone had made a call,
informing that he killed his own wife.

515
00:37:58,291 --> 00:38:01,208
After going to the spot,
I got to know it was Stephen's home.

516
00:38:02,125 --> 00:38:06,750
He said his dad killed his mom
in a fit of lust and then turned on him.

517
00:38:06,833 --> 00:38:08,333
He would've definitely done it.

518
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:12,208
Mad, disgusting pervert he was!

519
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,250
He posted my daughter's video
on the internet.

520
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:20,750
My daughter went into a shell.

521
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:24,000
She locked herself at home.

522
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:27,791
She even tried to take her own life.

523
00:38:33,583 --> 00:38:37,625
Sir, I saw Stephen as my own son.

524
00:38:38,833 --> 00:38:41,083
He is the same age as my daughter.

525
00:38:41,166 --> 00:38:42,750
They were classmates as well.

526
00:38:45,416 --> 00:38:49,500
I closed the case, stating Stephen's dad
killed his mom and committed suicide.

527
00:38:49,583 --> 00:38:51,041
What have you done, sir?

528
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:53,000
Consider it from a father's perspective.

529
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:54,041
No, sir!

530
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:58,458
If he was arrested back then,
nine innocent lives would've been saved.

531
00:38:58,541 --> 00:38:59,625
Dad?

532
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:02,583
Done with the invitations, dear?

533
00:39:02,666 --> 00:39:03,500
Yes, Dad.

534
00:39:03,583 --> 00:39:06,041
- Wait in the car. I'll be right back.
- Okay.

535
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:14,166
Sir, I understand your concern.

536
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:17,666
Nothing about the video, or the fact
that I did this for my daughter,

537
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:18,625
can be leaked out.

538
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:22,208
I'll take my leave, sir.

539
00:39:26,041 --> 00:39:27,041
Sir?

540
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:30,750
My daughter is getting married next month.

541
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:36,541
You should definitely come.

542
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:42,291
Hey, relax.

543
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:45,083
Emotional decisions are dangerous.

544
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:48,583
It's interesting how different minds react
under certain situations, right?

545
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,041
The case files say
his dad took his own life, right?

546
00:39:57,125 --> 00:39:59,500
But Stephen is the one who killed his dad.

547
00:40:00,958 --> 00:40:05,833
Wait... He doesn't know
that we know this information, right?

548
00:40:05,916 --> 00:40:07,333
This is a good opportunity.

549
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:13,083
We can find out if he is truthful
to you or not through this.

550
00:40:13,166 --> 00:40:16,458
And it'll be easy for us
to assess him and categorize him.

551
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,125
There are only two outcomes.

552
00:40:21,208 --> 00:40:23,291
Option A: Truth.

553
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:26,875
He must confess
that he killed his own dad.

554
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:30,666
If he does that, he's truthful to us.

555
00:40:31,416 --> 00:40:34,083
We can move on to next assessment
about his serial killings.

556
00:40:34,166 --> 00:40:35,583
No confusions.

557
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:37,083
If not,

558
00:40:37,166 --> 00:40:39,333
Option B: Lie.

559
00:40:40,416 --> 00:40:43,250
If he doesn't confess
that he killed his dad,

560
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:46,333
then he's a liar as the tests say.

561
00:40:48,375 --> 00:40:50,625
He could've hidden more from us.

562
00:40:51,666 --> 00:40:54,208
Both in the past and present.

563
00:40:56,375 --> 00:41:00,000
What if he surrendered
to save someone else?

564
00:41:03,041 --> 00:41:05,250
Or what if he's planning something big?

565
00:41:07,958 --> 00:41:09,958
Option A or Option B?

566
00:41:10,833 --> 00:41:12,208
We'll know tomorrow.

567
00:41:40,208 --> 00:41:44,375
New Year Eve, 2021.
What happened?

568
00:41:53,041 --> 00:41:54,416
Son.

569
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,958
Yes, Dad.

570
00:41:56,041 --> 00:41:57,500
Please help me.

571
00:41:57,583 --> 00:41:59,250
But I'm going out now.

572
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:02,333
I have kept Mom's saree on the table.
She asked me to iron it.

573
00:42:02,416 --> 00:42:04,583
You better do it. Or else you're doomed.

574
00:42:04,666 --> 00:42:08,291
She beat me up badly last time
because I didn't do a good job.

575
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:10,291
Then do it properly, Dad.
Why are you asking me?

576
00:42:10,375 --> 00:42:13,500
I slept late last night
after packing the New Year cakes.

577
00:42:13,583 --> 00:42:17,500
I even did your job
without Mom knowing.

578
00:42:17,583 --> 00:42:20,291
Okay, now what?
You want me to iron her saree?

579
00:42:20,375 --> 00:42:22,916
Yes, I'll take care of the rest.

580
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,125
What will you take care of?

581
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:28,000
Sweep the house, water the plants,
wash the dishes...

582
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:31,000
Okay, get it done, before Mom comes.

583
00:42:31,083 --> 00:42:32,625
- Okay, son.
- Carry on.

584
00:42:51,875 --> 00:42:52,916
Dad!

585
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:53,875
Dad!

586
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:57,208
What's wrong, son?
I didn't do anything.

587
00:42:57,291 --> 00:43:01,125
I've received a job offer in Chennai.
They have asked me to join in February.

588
00:43:01,208 --> 00:43:02,041
Okay, son.

589
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:04,333
Dad, at least try to smile?

590
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:08,708
No, you were better without it.

591
00:43:10,833 --> 00:43:13,333
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Love you, Jesus. Love you, Jesus.

592
00:43:16,875 --> 00:43:18,041
Oh, shit!

593
00:43:18,125 --> 00:43:19,041
What happened, son?

594
00:43:19,125 --> 00:43:20,833
Why are you running?

595
00:43:27,083 --> 00:43:29,708
Oh, my dear Lord.

596
00:43:29,791 --> 00:43:33,666
How can you be so careless, son?
It's your mom's New Year saree.

597
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:36,500
Dad, calm down.
It was my fault, right?

598
00:43:36,583 --> 00:43:38,000
Why are you freaking out?

599
00:43:38,083 --> 00:43:42,541
She'll hit me
for delegating my work to you.

600
00:43:42,625 --> 00:43:44,583
Dad, please calm down.
Let's handle it.

601
00:43:45,666 --> 00:43:46,958
What, son?

602
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,666
Don't you know your mom?

603
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:50,500
How can we handle her?

604
00:43:52,625 --> 00:43:54,958
Dad, come. Let's leave.

605
00:43:55,041 --> 00:43:57,833
Are you asking me to run away with you?

606
00:43:57,916 --> 00:43:58,916
No.

607
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,666
Let's buy a similar saree
before she comes.

608
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:02,708
Also, I'll treat you
on account of my new job.

609
00:44:02,791 --> 00:44:03,625
No, please.

610
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:07,458
I got a job now, right? You don't need
to be scared of her anymore.

611
00:44:07,541 --> 00:44:08,875
No, son.

612
00:44:08,958 --> 00:44:11,625
Dad, when was the last time
you left the house?

613
00:44:14,166 --> 00:44:15,625
I don't remember, son.

614
00:44:19,125 --> 00:44:22,083
Why are you doing all this?
I'm really scared, son.

615
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:25,666
Dad, I told you
that it's a treat for my new job.

616
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:29,458
Are you going to take me somewhere
and leave me stranded?

617
00:44:30,791 --> 00:44:32,916
I'm doing everything
that my body can handle.

618
00:44:33,791 --> 00:44:38,166
Even if your mom says so,
please don't give up on me, son.

619
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:41,250
Dad, it's nothing like that.
Believe me.

620
00:44:46,208 --> 00:44:48,208
Dad, I'll go and have a look.

621
00:44:52,416 --> 00:44:53,625
Got it!

622
00:44:57,541 --> 00:45:00,500
Al right, son, shall we go home now?

623
00:45:01,291 --> 00:45:02,791
Let's go...

624
00:45:02,875 --> 00:45:04,416
but for a long drive.

625
00:45:43,666 --> 00:45:44,500
Son?

626
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,416
Can you buy me a cigarette?

627
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,958
It's been ages.

628
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:08,000
Congratulations, son, on your job.

629
00:46:08,791 --> 00:46:09,958
Thanks, Dad.

630
00:46:13,916 --> 00:46:15,666
At least be happy
by moving out of the house.

631
00:46:16,916 --> 00:46:20,625
Why, Dad?
All three of us will be happy soon.

632
00:46:25,625 --> 00:46:27,500
Can I get one more cigarette?

633
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:30,416
I'll finish it off in two minutes.
Can I, son?

634
00:46:58,833 --> 00:47:00,041
Son.

635
00:47:00,125 --> 00:47:01,833
Can I get another smoke?

636
00:47:27,666 --> 00:47:30,041
Tell me, tell me, you filthy dog!

637
00:47:30,125 --> 00:47:32,875
- If you don't tell me--
- I didn't do anything.

638
00:47:37,583 --> 00:47:40,000
The saree seems to be new.
What did you do?

639
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:43,958
Say it louder.

640
00:47:44,666 --> 00:47:49,291
Don't lie. Stephen took you out, right?
Tell me the truth.

641
00:47:50,208 --> 00:47:51,541
- Let me go.
- Kneel down.

642
00:47:51,625 --> 00:47:55,041
- It hurts.
- I said, kneel down!

643
00:47:55,666 --> 00:47:57,625
Tell me. Tell me!

644
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:11,083
Please, let me put on my lungi.
I beg you.

645
00:48:11,166 --> 00:48:14,833
Oh, such a decent guy, huh?
Won't you obey my orders?

646
00:48:16,416 --> 00:48:19,375
How dare you disobey me?

647
00:48:21,041 --> 00:48:25,041
Use your mouth, good-for-nothing!

648
00:48:25,125 --> 00:48:26,375
Where did you both go?

649
00:48:26,458 --> 00:48:29,333
Both of you gained the courage
to step out of the house, right?

650
00:48:29,416 --> 00:48:30,750
Tell me!

651
00:48:30,833 --> 00:48:31,958
Mom.

652
00:48:32,041 --> 00:48:32,875
No.

653
00:48:34,958 --> 00:48:36,291
Please, Mom, that's enough.

654
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,708
He can't take any more.

655
00:48:42,875 --> 00:48:45,083
How dare you come in?

656
00:48:45,166 --> 00:48:47,125
Why did you come now?

657
00:48:47,208 --> 00:48:49,166
Sorry, Mom! Sorry!

658
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:53,208
Looks like you're no longer scared of me.
How dare you defend this filthy dog!

659
00:48:53,291 --> 00:48:55,916
Will you interfere again? Will you?

660
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,250
No, Mom.

661
00:48:58,833 --> 00:48:59,875
Sit.

662
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:01,916
Sit down!

663
00:49:06,875 --> 00:49:08,583
Hey, switch on the fan.

664
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:15,958
When I returned home, I noticed
the car's tires were not straight.

665
00:49:16,791 --> 00:49:20,916
I could smell cigarette smoke in the car.
I know that only this man smokes.

666
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,833
After all these years, he can't drive.

667
00:49:23,916 --> 00:49:25,875
Obviously it was you who took him.

668
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:32,541
I won't beat up the person
who spills the truth first.

669
00:49:32,625 --> 00:49:35,666
I was against the idea from the start.
But he kept insisting.

670
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:38,833
Your saree got burnt while ironing.

671
00:49:38,916 --> 00:49:42,125
That's why we went to the store
and bought a new one.

672
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,833
Sorry. Really, sorry.

673
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:49,791
Even you cannot be trusted
in this house anymore. Right, Stephen?

674
00:49:50,708 --> 00:49:53,458
Nothing like that, Mom.

675
00:49:54,833 --> 00:49:57,166
Despite working so hard for this family,

676
00:49:58,083 --> 00:49:59,500
you guys made a fool out of me.

677
00:50:03,708 --> 00:50:05,166
It's nothing, but...

678
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:09,250
Two good-for-nothings are home, right?

679
00:50:09,333 --> 00:50:11,000
Dad, please take that.

680
00:50:11,083 --> 00:50:13,916
Hereafter, you should come
to the bakery, Stephen.

681
00:50:16,875 --> 00:50:18,416
Hey. What was that?

682
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:22,250
What's that? Give it to me!

683
00:50:28,958 --> 00:50:35,583
"This is to inform you that you have been
appointed as Project Coordinator."

684
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:39,708
"And you're supposed
to report on February 2nd

685
00:50:40,416 --> 00:50:42,500
in the above mentioned address."

686
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,416
Why didn't you tell me about this?

687
00:50:46,666 --> 00:50:47,916
I was about to tell you, Mom.

688
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,083
Oh... Is that why you barged in?

689
00:50:52,291 --> 00:50:58,708
I was wondering, how did our boy get
such bravery and courage all of a sudden?

690
00:50:58,791 --> 00:51:00,500
This is the reason, then.

691
00:51:00,583 --> 00:51:02,166
Nothing like that, Mom.

692
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:06,125
I burnt your saree by mistake.

693
00:51:06,208 --> 00:51:08,416
I'm sorry for coming between you both.

694
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,166
Please leave me and do whatever you want.

695
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:12,833
What will you do then?

696
00:51:12,916 --> 00:51:14,500
Order me around from Chennai?

697
00:51:14,583 --> 00:51:17,541
No, Mom. I swear I won't.

698
00:51:17,625 --> 00:51:19,833
You're going to earn more than me.

699
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,875
Won't you prance around?

700
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:25,958
Haven't I seen
this filthy dog prance around before?

701
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:29,291
I wouldn't do that to you, Mom.

702
00:51:30,291 --> 00:51:32,083
I'll also help you by earning, Mom.

703
00:51:32,166 --> 00:51:35,458
Help? Wow, what a thought.

704
00:51:37,375 --> 00:51:39,250
Mom, I can't take it anymore.

705
00:51:40,833 --> 00:51:43,000
I think I'll go insane.

706
00:51:43,083 --> 00:51:44,416
I can't handle the both of you.

707
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:49,208
What the hell?
Are you comparing me with this dog?

708
00:51:49,291 --> 00:51:51,583
Mom, please.
Let me go to work.

709
00:51:51,666 --> 00:51:52,875
I will listen to whatever you say.

710
00:51:52,958 --> 00:51:55,916
I'm demanding you not to take this job,
can't you understand?

711
00:51:57,791 --> 00:51:58,875
I'm leaving.

712
00:51:59,625 --> 00:52:00,666
I can't take this anymore.

713
00:52:06,333 --> 00:52:07,708
So, you have made a decision.

714
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:09,541
Have you?

715
00:52:14,791 --> 00:52:15,625
Fine, son.

716
00:52:27,625 --> 00:52:28,666
Leave now!

717
00:52:31,541 --> 00:52:32,541
Hey!

718
00:52:32,625 --> 00:52:33,791
Will you let me leave for work?

719
00:52:33,875 --> 00:52:34,708
What?

720
00:52:34,791 --> 00:52:36,458
Will you let me leave or not?

721
00:52:36,541 --> 00:52:37,625
What?

722
00:52:37,708 --> 00:52:39,416
Will you let me leave or not?

723
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:12,375
Option A or Option B, Stephen?
What will you choose now?

724
00:53:16,375 --> 00:53:19,458
Mom, I'm asking you one last time.

725
00:53:20,375 --> 00:53:21,833
Will you let me leave or not?

726
00:54:47,208 --> 00:54:49,041
You dirty woman.

727
00:54:49,125 --> 00:54:51,208
It's a shame you died.

728
00:55:00,416 --> 00:55:02,458
Oh, my God!

729
00:55:02,541 --> 00:55:05,416
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

730
00:55:08,208 --> 00:55:10,666
My son! Do not cry.

731
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:13,000
I feel proud to be your dad.

732
00:55:14,291 --> 00:55:16,791
Don't shed tears for this dead bitch.

733
00:55:18,041 --> 00:55:20,250
Call the police.

734
00:55:20,916 --> 00:55:22,291
I will go to jail for you.

735
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:24,166
Hand me the knife.

736
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:26,541
It was I who killed her.

737
00:55:27,208 --> 00:55:28,666
Whoever asks, just say that.

738
00:55:30,541 --> 00:55:31,916
Wait, I'll tell them myself.

739
00:55:35,458 --> 00:55:37,958
Hey, move away.
Lying in the middle of the house.

740
00:55:38,708 --> 00:55:39,541
Hello, sir.

741
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:42,250
I am calling
from Pachapalayam, 5th Street.

742
00:55:42,333 --> 00:55:44,375
Door number 37.

743
00:55:44,458 --> 00:55:48,333
Just five minutes ago,
I stabbed my wife viciously.

744
00:55:49,166 --> 00:55:50,958
Oh, yes, sir. I did a number on her!

745
00:55:51,041 --> 00:55:52,416
Please come soon.

746
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:57,750
And let the headlines tomorrow be,
"A warrior who slayed his wife."

747
00:55:57,833 --> 00:56:00,541
Then, sir, who'll call the media?
You or me?

748
00:56:02,041 --> 00:56:03,583
Hello?

749
00:56:04,375 --> 00:56:06,791
What's this, son?
They're abruptly cutting the call.

750
00:56:07,708 --> 00:56:09,375
Not a problem.

751
00:56:10,291 --> 00:56:11,291
Be brave.

752
00:56:11,375 --> 00:56:13,166
Don't worry about anything.

753
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:17,416
Hey, woman, look at my son.
He cut you open pretty well, right?

754
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,916
My son, I'm so happy.

755
00:56:21,375 --> 00:56:24,291
Will you buy your dad a cigarette?

756
00:56:26,208 --> 00:56:27,541
No. Ignore that.

757
00:56:27,625 --> 00:56:29,333
Police and media can come anytime.

758
00:56:30,166 --> 00:56:32,625
I should be in the spot.

759
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:37,375
Oops. I feel like peeing.

760
00:56:38,875 --> 00:56:40,750
Sorry, no time to use the bathroom.

761
00:56:41,541 --> 00:56:42,833
What is she here for?

762
00:58:14,166 --> 00:58:16,000
Happy new year.

763
00:58:53,583 --> 00:58:56,916
<i>A twist in the nine missing women case!</i>

764
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:03,291
<i>A man in his mid-twenties has surrendered
at Perur Police Station a few hours ago--</i>

765
00:59:15,333 --> 00:59:17,791
<i>This has caused an uproar.</i>

766
00:59:17,875 --> 00:59:23,541
<i>The case is led by Inspector Michael
with a special team.</i>

767
00:59:30,916 --> 00:59:33,291
Why is he voluntarily
accepting both the murders?

768
00:59:34,083 --> 00:59:37,750
Instead of A or B,
he's surprising us with an Option C.

769
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,041
Can I tell you something even more random?

770
00:59:41,125 --> 00:59:44,208
Stephen was in Chennai for a year
and a half after his parents' death.

771
00:59:44,875 --> 00:59:46,416
I inquired there.

772
00:59:48,416 --> 00:59:49,541
Watch this video.

773
00:59:51,541 --> 00:59:54,250
<i>Sir, I'm here
at Stephen's Chennai apartment.</i>

774
00:59:54,333 --> 00:59:57,166
<i>The security guard is saying something.
Listen to it, sir.</i>

775
00:59:57,250 --> 01:00:00,500
<i>Sir, please repeat
everything you just told me.</i>

776
01:00:00,583 --> 01:00:01,625
<i>Sir?</i>

777
01:00:02,416 --> 01:00:06,000
<i>Sir, this guy was staying here
a few months ago.</i>

778
01:00:06,083 --> 01:00:07,291
<i>Can you say more about him?</i>

779
01:00:07,875 --> 01:00:11,583
<i>Nothing much. He'll just mind
his own business. That's it.</i>

780
01:00:11,666 --> 01:00:13,583
<i>- You mentioned a girl?
- Yes, sir.</i>

781
01:00:13,666 --> 01:00:15,250
<i>There was a girl staying with him.</i>

782
01:00:15,333 --> 01:00:16,625
<i>Her age?</i>

783
01:00:16,708 --> 01:00:17,833
<i>Same as the boy's.</i>

784
01:00:17,916 --> 01:00:22,041
<i>Oh. Can you say more about the girl?
What does she look like? Any details?</i>

785
01:00:22,125 --> 01:00:24,166
<i>She looked very girly, sir.</i>

786
01:00:24,833 --> 01:00:28,375
Stephen went to a church
before he surrendered, Seema.

787
01:00:29,416 --> 01:00:33,291
We'd collected the footage
by tracking his car number.

788
01:00:33,375 --> 01:00:37,208
We thought that he just went
to pray before surrendering.

789
01:00:38,625 --> 01:00:41,250
Now this video makes me wonder.

790
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,583
Stephen is not a believer, Michael.

791
01:00:47,875 --> 01:00:49,875
What if he had gone there
to see someone?

792
01:00:51,375 --> 01:00:53,916
And what if he surrendered
to save that person?

793
01:00:55,125 --> 01:00:56,291
Maybe.

794
01:00:56,375 --> 01:00:58,041
Which church did Stephen go to?

795
01:00:58,791 --> 01:01:01,083
St. Mary's Church, Thondamuthur.

796
01:01:03,458 --> 01:01:07,541
Michael, I told you about a Christianity
band I got from his house, right?

797
01:01:07,625 --> 01:01:09,416
That band had the same church's name.

798
01:01:17,083 --> 01:01:22,125
You see, every year,
we organize a youth retreat.

799
01:01:22,208 --> 01:01:25,250
To restore faith in today's youngsters.

800
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:28,208
Just two months ago, we organized one.

801
01:01:28,875 --> 01:01:30,708
This looks like a wristband
from that retreat.

802
01:01:30,791 --> 01:01:33,958
Father, is there a list of the attendants?

803
01:01:34,041 --> 01:01:37,375
Sure. Give me an official request letter.
I'll share.

804
01:01:38,583 --> 01:01:43,708
Father, it's impossible for us
to operate this officially.

805
01:01:43,791 --> 01:01:48,750
The entire media is frantic
to get any news about him.

806
01:01:48,833 --> 01:01:53,083
Moreover, there is a CCTV footage
of him coming to the church.

807
01:01:53,875 --> 01:01:55,208
That's why.

808
01:01:58,125 --> 01:01:59,291
Usually,

809
01:01:59,375 --> 01:02:01,708
there will be separate colors
for male and female.

810
01:02:02,541 --> 01:02:04,250
This specific color is for a female.

811
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:11,666
So, Stephen was not alone
in these murders.

812
01:02:12,416 --> 01:02:13,916
There was a girl with him.

813
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:18,125
The girl mentioned
by the guard in Chennai

814
01:02:18,208 --> 01:02:21,500
and the owner of the band
could be the same, right?

815
01:02:24,583 --> 01:02:26,708
If we remove the men from this list,

816
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,416
there are 159 names in total.

817
01:02:31,333 --> 01:02:33,041
Sorry, 158.

818
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:34,708
What next?

819
01:02:35,416 --> 01:02:39,958
<i>That guard mentioned that
the girl is the same age as Stephen.</i>

820
01:02:41,208 --> 01:02:47,541
So, keep anyone in the age bracket
of 22-25 and remove the rest.

821
01:02:49,125 --> 01:02:51,750
Seventy-two in total. What now?

822
01:02:53,458 --> 01:02:57,791
Hopefully, our girl
should be one among this 72.

823
01:02:59,875 --> 01:03:00,916
Interesting.

824
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,375
So, you have also failed at times?

825
01:03:02,458 --> 01:03:05,333
At times. Never mind it.

826
01:03:07,666 --> 01:03:10,708
Okay. Seems like
subtlety is not your thing.

827
01:03:10,791 --> 01:03:12,083
Didn't the police look into this?

828
01:03:12,166 --> 01:03:15,541
They did.
But only after I killed two or three.

829
01:03:16,791 --> 01:03:19,833
I have gone through many
police check posts with bodies in my car.

830
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:21,875
No one suspected me.

831
01:03:22,583 --> 01:03:23,708
I have an innocent face.

832
01:03:28,166 --> 01:03:30,500
Didn't you share this
with anyone in Chennai?

833
01:03:30,583 --> 01:03:31,416
No.

834
01:03:32,291 --> 01:03:35,666
I don't get along
with anyone that quickly.

835
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:36,833
So you were alone there?

836
01:03:36,916 --> 01:03:37,833
Yes.

837
01:03:38,583 --> 01:03:40,375
Didn't you kill anyone in Chennai?

838
01:03:44,208 --> 01:03:45,333
Stephen?

839
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:50,666
I told you, right?

840
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:53,041
I tried to kill that sex worker.

841
01:03:54,125 --> 01:03:56,166
After that, I ran away from Chennai.

842
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,541
Are you sure?

843
01:03:58,625 --> 01:04:01,250
Madam, I already told you no, right?

844
01:04:02,333 --> 01:04:04,666
- Okay, so when you were in Chennai--
- Madam...

845
01:04:06,291 --> 01:04:07,375
enough.

846
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:10,625
- Can we continue tomorrow?
- Why?

847
01:04:10,708 --> 01:04:12,041
No...

848
01:04:12,125 --> 01:04:13,125
It's enough.

849
01:04:14,208 --> 01:04:16,166
Sure. No problem.

850
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:17,333
Excuse me.

851
01:04:20,958 --> 01:04:21,791
Stephen.

852
01:04:23,333 --> 01:04:28,166
Don't get into any negative thoughts.
Any problem, I'm just a call away.

853
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:30,416
Okay, madam.

854
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:39,625
- Hello
<i>- Hello.</i>

855
01:04:39,708 --> 01:04:41,833
Stephen is hiding something big.

856
01:04:41,916 --> 01:04:44,208
He's fumbling a lot
when I mention Chennai.

857
01:04:44,291 --> 01:04:47,000
For the first time ever,
he asked to stop the discussion.

858
01:04:48,041 --> 01:04:51,000
For now, we have to find
that girl from church soon.

859
01:04:51,083 --> 01:04:52,125
We'll catch her.

860
01:04:52,208 --> 01:04:53,083
How?

861
01:05:01,208 --> 01:05:02,333
How can I do this, sir?

862
01:05:03,375 --> 01:05:05,958
Please, Father. Try to understand.

863
01:05:06,041 --> 01:05:07,916
He's committed a lot of murders till date.

864
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,541
We have to pursue with even
the smallest of leads regarding him.

865
01:05:11,625 --> 01:05:14,750
If Stephen finds out about it
from the media,

866
01:05:14,833 --> 01:05:16,208
it will be a very big problem, Father.

867
01:05:16,291 --> 01:05:17,708
We cannot deal this as usual.

868
01:05:17,791 --> 01:05:20,666
Sir! You always keep saying
this is a media problem.

869
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,041
That is the truth, Father.

870
01:05:22,125 --> 01:05:24,000
This is a very sensitive case.

871
01:05:24,083 --> 01:05:27,125
Our every movement
is fodder for the media.

872
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:30,125
What should I do now?

873
01:05:30,208 --> 01:05:31,041
Tell me clearly.

874
01:05:32,375 --> 01:05:33,541
Father,

875
01:05:33,625 --> 01:05:36,583
we should get the 72 girls on this list
to come to the church.

876
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:37,708
How?

877
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:40,916
In the Bible, there's someone
named Stephen, right?

878
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,583
Yes. St. Stephen.

879
01:05:45,083 --> 01:05:47,333
- What about him?
- Tell me a little about him.

880
01:05:50,166 --> 01:05:53,166
St. Stephen was the first
to sacrifice his life for Jesus.

881
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:59,250
He was beaten to death
for preaching Jesus's principles.

882
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:02,916
Even as he was dying,

883
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:07,708
he believed that God would forgive
those who killed him.

884
01:06:09,208 --> 01:06:10,708
You can tell this to the girls, Father.

885
01:06:10,791 --> 01:06:12,583
This? How?

886
01:06:14,208 --> 01:06:16,708
Say that St. Stephen came in your dream.

887
01:06:16,791 --> 01:06:18,541
Seems like someone has lied to him.

888
01:06:18,625 --> 01:06:21,083
So, he seems to be very angry on us.

889
01:06:21,166 --> 01:06:23,083
Hence we should ask Jesus for forgiveness.

890
01:06:23,166 --> 01:06:25,833
Tomorrow... Tomorrow is Sunday, right?

891
01:06:25,916 --> 01:06:29,666
Tell them there is a prayer tomorrow
and ask them to come.

892
01:06:32,666 --> 01:06:33,500
Okay.

893
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:26,541
Michael, they have been waiting
for quite some time.

894
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:27,750
Shall I start the prayer?

895
01:07:27,833 --> 01:07:29,666
You carry on, Father.

896
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:32,041
Raju, have our guys taken the list?

897
01:07:32,125 --> 01:07:34,041
It'll be done in ten minutes, sir.

898
01:07:35,333 --> 01:07:37,916
Are you not going
to interrogate any of them?

899
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,666
Even after our lie about St. Stephen,
so many girls have come.

900
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:46,250
It's doubtful that there is a link
between killer Stephen and them.

901
01:07:47,083 --> 01:07:49,208
There are a few
who have not shown up today.

902
01:07:49,291 --> 01:07:50,708
We need to track them first.

903
01:07:51,416 --> 01:07:53,666
What if there's no clue in that?

904
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:56,916
No other option, Father,
but to interrogate the entire list.

905
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,791
Let's see, Father.

906
01:07:58,875 --> 01:08:00,916
The Lord shall be with you.

907
01:08:03,291 --> 01:08:05,333
Sister, how many are here?

908
01:08:05,416 --> 01:08:06,375
Fifty eight, sir.

909
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:09,500
Why have you asked for them to come, sir?

910
01:08:09,583 --> 01:08:11,583
I'll tell you.
Have you ticked the attendees?

911
01:08:11,666 --> 01:08:13,083
Yes, sir. Hand it to him.

912
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:14,625
Sir.

913
01:08:14,708 --> 01:08:16,083
Our team's list.

914
01:08:21,125 --> 01:08:25,041
Raju, ask Ravi to track the location
of the 14 girls who didn't come.

915
01:08:25,125 --> 01:08:26,041
<i>Okay, sir.</i>

916
01:09:04,333 --> 01:09:06,125
Michael?

917
01:09:06,208 --> 01:09:08,833
What are you doing here?
I was looking for you.

918
01:09:13,333 --> 01:09:15,458
What happened at the church today?

919
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:18,625
I have checked the girls
who did not attend the prayer.

920
01:09:19,541 --> 01:09:22,541
All of them had valid reasons.

921
01:09:22,625 --> 01:09:27,291
I thought she'll get caught, but it looks
like we have to interrogate all of them.

922
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,750
For that, I've to get permission,
explain the situation.

923
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:34,125
The important thing
is to keep this information secure.

924
01:09:34,875 --> 01:09:36,083
Why do you have two lists?

925
01:09:36,833 --> 01:09:42,333
One was given by the Father
and checked by the nuns at the front desk.

926
01:09:42,416 --> 01:09:44,583
The other one was taken live by our team.

927
01:09:45,583 --> 01:09:48,666
Have you thoroughly inquired
about the 15 non-attendees?

928
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:50,416
You don't suspect even one of them?

929
01:09:52,208 --> 01:09:54,708
Not 15. Only 14.

930
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:57,916
See, look at this.

931
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,916
Your list has 57 names, right?

932
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,250
So, out of 72, if 57 attended,
then it is 15 who didn't attend, right?

933
01:10:11,041 --> 01:10:12,166
Look at this.

934
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:14,083
The nuns at the church ticked this list.

935
01:10:14,166 --> 01:10:16,041
There are 58 names ticked in this.

936
01:10:22,458 --> 01:10:25,458
Raju? Did you get details
from all the attendees?

937
01:10:25,541 --> 01:10:27,208
<i>Of course, sir. What happened?</i>

938
01:10:27,291 --> 01:10:29,291
You sure we didn't miss anyone?

939
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:31,708
<i>Sure, sir. There is no chance of missing.</i>

940
01:10:32,916 --> 01:10:34,041
Okay.

941
01:10:36,208 --> 01:10:37,250
Michael.

942
01:10:37,916 --> 01:10:39,625
This name is not in your list.

943
01:10:42,333 --> 01:10:43,583
Mary John.

944
01:10:44,958 --> 01:10:46,750
How the hell did I miss her?

945
01:10:48,041 --> 01:10:50,666
Maybe she would've guessed that
you're police and escaped immediately.

946
01:10:55,458 --> 01:10:57,291
Michael? Where are you going?

947
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,958
I want to know how the nuns ticked
Mary's name which wasn't on our list.

948
01:11:01,041 --> 01:11:03,000
Will anyone be in the church at this time?

949
01:11:03,083 --> 01:11:05,083
That priest's house
is inside the church compound.

950
01:11:05,166 --> 01:11:06,000
I'll come along.

951
01:11:07,333 --> 01:11:09,125
Sir! Madam!

952
01:11:09,208 --> 01:11:10,666
Stephen attempted suicide.

953
01:11:15,333 --> 01:11:18,083
What if Mary has informed Stephen
about our movements?

954
01:11:21,166 --> 01:11:23,250
You go look into Stephen.
I'll ask Raju to come.

955
01:11:23,333 --> 01:11:24,875
I'll take care of Mary.

956
01:11:32,541 --> 01:11:33,583
Seema!

957
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:36,208
Careful.

958
01:12:05,625 --> 01:12:07,000
Father. Emergency.

959
01:12:07,083 --> 01:12:07,916
Michael?

960
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,041
Mary's name was ticked off by the nuns.
But that name is not on our list.

961
01:12:11,625 --> 01:12:13,708
I don't get it. Calm down.

962
01:12:15,291 --> 01:12:16,291
- Sister.
- Sir?

963
01:12:16,375 --> 01:12:18,375
- You were at the front desk, right?
- Yes, sir.

964
01:12:18,458 --> 01:12:21,583
Did you tick Mary's name?
That name is not on our list.

965
01:12:21,666 --> 01:12:23,375
How can you tick a non-attendee?

966
01:12:23,458 --> 01:12:25,416
No, sir. I wouldn't have done that.

967
01:12:26,458 --> 01:12:27,750
What's the name again?

968
01:12:27,833 --> 01:12:28,916
Mary John.

969
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,958
Mary John? She was there, sir.

970
01:12:31,666 --> 01:12:33,166
Then how is she not on our list?

971
01:12:34,416 --> 01:12:38,750
Maybe your team would've missed
because she didn't sit inside.

972
01:12:38,833 --> 01:12:39,875
Why didn't she sit inside?

973
01:12:39,958 --> 01:12:42,041
Because she was sitting with me.

974
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:43,333
Didn't you see?

975
01:12:46,166 --> 01:12:48,208
Where? Where? Where?

976
01:13:07,166 --> 01:13:08,541
Is Mary John...

977
01:13:10,166 --> 01:13:11,375
a nun?

978
01:13:11,458 --> 01:13:14,791
No, sir.
She joined here only two months back.

979
01:13:17,791 --> 01:13:18,833
Can I get her address?

980
01:13:18,916 --> 01:13:21,000
You must've passed by her.

981
01:13:21,083 --> 01:13:22,083
She was at the front.

982
01:13:43,708 --> 01:13:44,833
Mary.

983
01:13:57,875 --> 01:13:59,500
Is this your band?

984
01:14:03,291 --> 01:14:04,125
Yes.

985
01:14:04,208 --> 01:14:07,041
How long have you known Stephen?

986
01:14:07,833 --> 01:14:09,375
For the past few months.

987
01:14:09,458 --> 01:14:14,041
Did Stephen come to see you
at the church on July 8th?

988
01:14:14,125 --> 01:14:15,041
Yes.

989
01:14:15,125 --> 01:14:16,958
What did you guys talk about?

990
01:14:17,041 --> 01:14:18,041
Nothing at all.

991
01:14:19,250 --> 01:14:21,916
Do you have anything to do
with Stephen's crimes?

992
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:24,666
Are you his family?

993
01:14:25,875 --> 01:14:27,541
Who are you then?

994
01:14:28,916 --> 01:14:30,833
I was supposed to be his...

995
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:32,750
tenth victim.

996
01:14:36,083 --> 01:14:37,166
Sorry?

997
01:14:38,041 --> 01:14:40,000
That's what Stephen said to me.

998
01:14:41,125 --> 01:14:42,458
Then how did you escape?

999
01:14:43,958 --> 01:14:45,833
Stephen dropped me back at my house.

1000
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:49,041
He said it was not safe
to travel alone late night.

1001
01:14:49,958 --> 01:14:51,000
What next?

1002
01:14:51,083 --> 01:14:52,875
Did he buy you a packet
of milk and bread?

1003
01:14:59,125 --> 01:15:04,541
Mary, since you come from a holy place,
I'm treating you politely.

1004
01:15:05,208 --> 01:15:10,708
If you continue to lie, we'll expose you
as Stephen's lover or accomplice.

1005
01:15:11,875 --> 01:15:14,791
If you tell the truth,
everything will go smoothly.

1006
01:15:18,375 --> 01:15:19,791
Stephen was right.

1007
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:24,166
This is why he told me
not to go to the police.

1008
01:15:25,666 --> 01:15:26,833
Did he?

1009
01:15:28,833 --> 01:15:31,416
He said the good have no business there.

1010
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:34,750
That's exactly what's happening now.

1011
01:15:35,708 --> 01:15:37,375
I'm being threatened.

1012
01:15:37,458 --> 01:15:38,625
Then tell the truth.

1013
01:15:38,708 --> 01:15:41,500
If you're so good and pious,
what have you been doing with Stephen?

1014
01:15:43,333 --> 01:15:47,583
I started believing in the Lord
only after he let me live.

1015
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:51,875
In fact, this is my second life.

1016
01:15:53,541 --> 01:15:56,833
Then how did you get the wristband?
Didn't you attend the youth retreat?

1017
01:15:57,458 --> 01:16:01,166
I did attend.
Because of my parents' compulsion.

1018
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:08,375
I was an actor back then,
doing short films and web series.

1019
01:16:09,875 --> 01:16:13,041
<i>That's how I went to Stephen's house
that day for an audition.</i>

1020
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,750
<i>I'm not sure what exactly happened.</i>

1021
01:16:16,833 --> 01:16:18,333
<i>He suddenly got emotional.</i>

1022
01:16:18,416 --> 01:16:20,333
If I don't understand you, then who will?

1023
01:16:22,375 --> 01:16:23,416
Okay.

1024
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,125
Please wait for two minutes.

1025
01:16:35,791 --> 01:16:37,625
Do you have so much faith in love?

1026
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:48,375
I believe love has the ultimate power
to save life at any situation.

1027
01:16:51,958 --> 01:16:54,083
Stephen, is that a prop?

1028
01:16:54,666 --> 01:16:58,083
No. I've killed nine people with this.

1029
01:17:00,125 --> 01:17:01,916
You were supposed to be my tenth victim.

1030
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:06,000
But I don't feel
like killing you anymore.

1031
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,333
My heart is telling me
to surrender myself to the police.

1032
01:17:11,208 --> 01:17:12,791
Keep this for your safety.

1033
01:17:16,625 --> 01:17:18,208
I will drop you back.

1034
01:17:30,875 --> 01:17:32,791
Please sit in the back.

1035
01:17:44,125 --> 01:17:45,083
Mary.

1036
01:17:46,583 --> 01:17:48,125
Thanks for understanding.

1037
01:17:49,125 --> 01:17:50,791
Can you do me a favor?

1038
01:17:52,166 --> 01:17:53,208
What is it?

1039
01:17:53,291 --> 01:17:56,583
I don't know how my life will turn
after I surrender.

1040
01:17:58,083 --> 01:17:59,416
Can I see you for one last time?

1041
01:18:02,541 --> 01:18:03,875
We don't even have to talk.

1042
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:05,500
Just want to see you.

1043
01:18:06,875 --> 01:18:07,875
Please?

1044
01:18:10,666 --> 01:18:14,166
My mom regularly visits
St. Mary's Church, Thondamuthur.

1045
01:18:15,916 --> 01:18:17,083
I can go with her tomorrow.

1046
01:18:17,666 --> 01:18:19,125
I'll be there as well.

1047
01:18:19,791 --> 01:18:21,333
Stay away from the police.

1048
01:18:22,791 --> 01:18:24,666
Good people like you
have no place there.

1049
01:18:26,625 --> 01:18:29,250
If there's no news
about my surrender tomorrow,

1050
01:18:30,333 --> 01:18:31,875
please don't be in this house.

1051
01:18:37,791 --> 01:18:39,750
The next day,
I went to church with fear.

1052
01:18:40,791 --> 01:18:42,500
<i>Stephen was waiting for me.</i>

1053
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:46,833
<i>We didn't talk.</i>

1054
01:18:48,666 --> 01:18:50,416
<i>He watched me from a distance and left.</i>

1055
01:19:01,208 --> 01:19:04,208
Why didn't you come to us
after Stephen surrendered?

1056
01:19:05,083 --> 01:19:07,833
I saw in the news
that he confessed to all his crimes.

1057
01:19:09,166 --> 01:19:10,833
What more can I add?

1058
01:19:11,625 --> 01:19:14,041
So, after that, you became a believer?

1059
01:19:15,666 --> 01:19:17,458
I barely survived this situation.

1060
01:19:18,166 --> 01:19:23,250
I sacrificed my acting, my passion
by devoting myself to the church.

1061
01:19:23,333 --> 01:19:24,458
Sir.

1062
01:19:29,875 --> 01:19:31,125
News from Chennai.

1063
01:19:31,791 --> 01:19:34,958
Mary's photo was shown
to that security guard for identification.

1064
01:19:35,041 --> 01:19:37,583
Mary is not the girl
who stayed with Stephen.

1065
01:19:39,250 --> 01:19:41,916
Also, Stephen did not attempt suicide.

1066
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,333
Someone poisoned his coffee.

1067
01:19:44,416 --> 01:19:47,000
We are investigating
if it's the victims' relatives.

1068
01:19:48,666 --> 01:19:50,166
What do you think?

1069
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:54,666
Mary doesn't seem to be lying.

1070
01:19:57,083 --> 01:20:00,583
We are definitely missing something.
But I'm not sure what it is.

1071
01:20:11,666 --> 01:20:15,208
Mary, give your details to Raju.

1072
01:20:15,291 --> 01:20:18,041
If summoned for further enquiry,
you should come immediately.

1073
01:20:24,333 --> 01:20:25,166
Mary?

1074
01:20:26,416 --> 01:20:28,166
What was the audition scene
he asked you to act?

1075
01:20:30,541 --> 01:20:32,791
A story about a serial killer.

1076
01:20:33,875 --> 01:20:35,416
He said it was a love scene from that.

1077
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:36,666
Love?

1078
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:40,125
You mean,
Stephen was in love with someone?

1079
01:20:41,458 --> 01:20:43,416
Apparently, the girl loved him back too.

1080
01:20:44,208 --> 01:20:45,583
A girl was in love with Stephen?

1081
01:20:46,375 --> 01:20:47,708
That's what he said.

1082
01:20:48,916 --> 01:20:50,000
Did he say her name?

1083
01:20:52,541 --> 01:20:55,125
Kir... Keerthana?

1084
01:20:56,375 --> 01:20:57,541
Krithika.

1085
01:20:58,291 --> 01:20:59,500
Krithika?

1086
01:21:02,416 --> 01:21:05,375
What did he make you enact that day?
Can you please elaborate?

1087
01:21:15,416 --> 01:21:17,166
Have you been in love, Stephen?

1088
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,125
Then who's Krithika?

1089
01:21:32,583 --> 01:21:33,666
Michael.

1090
01:22:48,291 --> 01:22:51,000
<i>Hey girl, it's you</i>

1091
01:22:51,083 --> 01:22:53,916
<i>A magnet that pulls me</i>

1092
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,125
<i>The eyes that transcend the soul</i>

1093
01:23:00,166 --> 01:23:03,208
<i>Your beaming smile</i>

1094
01:23:03,291 --> 01:23:06,166
<i>Mesmerizes me</i>

1095
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:10,250
<i>You cast a spell on me</i>

1096
01:23:11,041 --> 01:23:15,291
<i>I'm not myself 'cause of you</i>

1097
01:23:15,375 --> 01:23:18,708
<i>You blended into my soul</i>

1098
01:23:18,791 --> 01:23:23,166
<i>Don't you pass as a dream</i>

1099
01:23:24,458 --> 01:23:28,458
<i>You are my love island</i>

1100
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:34,500
<i>My partner for life</i>

1101
01:23:35,916 --> 01:23:38,708
<i>You are the walking moon on earth</i>

1102
01:23:38,791 --> 01:23:41,916
<i>My beloved moon</i>

1103
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,000
<i>I'll wait for you</i>

1104
01:23:45,083 --> 01:23:46,833
<i>Will never leave</i>

1105
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,666
<i>It's like raining flowers</i>

1106
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:52,708
<i>When you kiss</i>

1107
01:23:52,791 --> 01:23:54,250
<i>Let's surpass time</i>

1108
01:23:54,333 --> 01:23:59,291
<i>As it never exists</i>

1109
01:24:22,583 --> 01:24:25,833
<i>I've lost the path, seeking alone</i>

1110
01:24:25,916 --> 01:24:28,916
<i>Your sparkling eyes are a welcoming beacon</i>

1111
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,708
<i>In the thought of accompanying you</i>

1112
01:24:31,791 --> 01:24:35,041
<i>I lost my soul in you</i>

1113
01:24:35,125 --> 01:24:37,750
<i>My words and breath</i>

1114
01:24:37,833 --> 01:24:40,666
<i>Raves about your smile, and you</i>

1115
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:43,666
<i>Heaven and Earth</i>

1116
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:47,291
<i>Singing your beauty as a masterpiece</i>

1117
01:24:47,375 --> 01:24:48,541
Do you believe in such traditions?

1118
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:51,916
Trust me. This will reunite us
even in our next lives.

1119
01:24:53,833 --> 01:24:59,333
<i>Don't be a footprint on the shore</i>

1120
01:24:59,416 --> 01:25:02,791
<i>Hey, my dearest rainbow</i>

1121
01:25:02,875 --> 01:25:09,666
<i>Won't you slowly settle with me?</i>

1122
01:25:11,083 --> 01:25:17,250
<i>In snow or sun, I'll keep you safe</i>

1123
01:25:17,333 --> 01:25:23,625
<i>In Pain or pleasure, I'll be your shoulder</i>

1124
01:25:23,708 --> 01:25:26,458
<i>You are the walking moon on earth</i>

1125
01:25:26,541 --> 01:25:29,708
<i>My beloved moon</i>

1126
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:32,458
<i>I'll wait for you</i>

1127
01:25:32,541 --> 01:25:34,750
<i>Will never leave</i>

1128
01:25:35,875 --> 01:25:38,708
<i>It's like raining flowers</i>

1129
01:25:38,791 --> 01:25:41,916
<i>When you kiss</i>

1130
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,875
<i>Let's surpass time</i>

1131
01:25:44,958 --> 01:25:47,708
<i>As it never exists</i>

1132
01:26:18,708 --> 01:26:20,500
<i>Leaving my past behind,</i>

1133
01:26:20,583 --> 01:26:24,750
<i>I wanted to start my life afresh,
with my Krithika in our new home.</i>

1134
01:26:26,083 --> 01:26:27,666
<i>But it was too late.</i>

1135
01:26:28,458 --> 01:26:30,250
<i>The damage was already done.</i>

1136
01:26:52,166 --> 01:26:53,666
<i>Stephen?</i>

1137
01:27:00,541 --> 01:27:01,583
<i>Stephen!</i>

1138
01:27:02,125 --> 01:27:05,833
<i>You've hung me
a centimeter lower than your mom.</i>

1139
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:08,166
<i>Hang me higher, son.</i>

1140
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,958
<i>Don't listen to him!</i>

1141
01:27:21,041 --> 01:27:22,666
<i>Let me be at the top.</i>

1142
01:27:23,333 --> 01:27:27,250
<i>Petty fool,
you don't deserve to be framed.</i>

1143
01:27:27,333 --> 01:27:29,625
<i>- Shut up and hang below me.
- Yeah, right.</i>

1144
01:27:29,708 --> 01:27:32,583
<i>You deserve a statue,
but he framed you instead.</i>

1145
01:27:32,666 --> 01:27:37,166
<i>First of all, it's a shame
that I'm letting you talk.</i>

1146
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:38,166
<i>Good-for-nothing.</i>

1147
01:27:38,250 --> 01:27:41,625
<i>Marrying you was
the worst mistake of my life. Bloody pest!</i>

1148
01:27:41,708 --> 01:27:43,750
<i>I'm unable to escape from you,
even after my death.</i>

1149
01:27:43,833 --> 01:27:45,458
<i>Mind you, I'll whoop your ass!</i>

1150
01:27:45,541 --> 01:27:47,041
<i>Stephen, fix it.</i>

1151
01:27:47,125 --> 01:27:48,166
<i>Don't you dare, Stephen.</i>

1152
01:27:48,250 --> 01:27:49,375
<i>Do it, son.</i>

1153
01:27:49,458 --> 01:27:50,333
<i>Don't do it.</i>

1154
01:27:50,416 --> 01:27:51,250
<i>Do it.</i>

1155
01:27:51,333 --> 01:27:52,166
<i>- Don't do it.
- Do it.</i>

1156
01:27:52,250 --> 01:27:53,333
<i>- Don't.
- Do it.</i>

1157
01:27:53,416 --> 01:27:54,583
<i>- Don't.
- Do it.</i>

1158
01:27:54,666 --> 01:27:55,750
<i>- Don't.
- Do it.</i>

1159
01:27:55,833 --> 01:27:56,791
<i>- Don't.
- Do it.</i>

1160
01:27:56,875 --> 01:27:58,375
<i>- Don't.
- Do it.</i>

1161
01:28:10,291 --> 01:28:11,291
Krithika.

1162
01:28:12,708 --> 01:28:13,958
Yeah?

1163
01:28:15,291 --> 01:28:17,208
I lied to you.

1164
01:28:17,791 --> 01:28:20,916
I've told you a million times
not to lie to me.

1165
01:28:26,541 --> 01:28:28,083
Okay. What is it?

1166
01:28:33,791 --> 01:28:34,833
Tell me.

1167
01:28:34,916 --> 01:28:36,791
I killed my parents.

1168
01:28:36,875 --> 01:28:38,625
Don't blabber.

1169
01:28:40,375 --> 01:28:41,375
I'm not.

1170
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,125
The police report is fake.

1171
01:28:44,791 --> 01:28:46,000
I killed my parents.

1172
01:28:46,083 --> 01:28:47,541
What are you saying?

1173
01:28:48,250 --> 01:28:49,250
Yes.

1174
01:28:54,291 --> 01:28:55,916
Things got ugly that night.

1175
01:28:56,666 --> 01:28:58,166
They didn't let me leave for Chennai.

1176
01:28:59,791 --> 01:29:01,291
I killed them.

1177
01:29:16,833 --> 01:29:20,083
Krithika, you won't leave me, right?

1178
01:29:24,125 --> 01:29:26,916
Krithika, it wasn't my fault.

1179
01:29:29,291 --> 01:29:30,791
You won't leave me, right?

1180
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:33,000
Tell me.

1181
01:29:33,666 --> 01:29:35,000
Tell me, Krithika.

1182
01:29:35,083 --> 01:29:36,291
No, Stephen.

1183
01:29:36,375 --> 01:29:37,500
- Tell me.
- Go to bed, please.

1184
01:29:37,583 --> 01:29:38,583
Stephen, sleep.

1185
01:29:39,250 --> 01:29:41,958
Let's talk in the morning. Now sleep.

1186
01:29:44,041 --> 01:29:45,875
You know about them, right?

1187
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:50,791
Krithika.

1188
01:29:50,875 --> 01:29:52,291
Yeah?

1189
01:29:52,375 --> 01:29:54,041
I lied to you again.

1190
01:29:54,750 --> 01:29:55,583
What is it?

1191
01:29:56,375 --> 01:29:57,625
I didn't kill my parents.

1192
01:29:59,458 --> 01:30:02,583
That's what I thought.
Why would you joke about this?

1193
01:30:02,666 --> 01:30:04,375
He killed them.

1194
01:30:05,791 --> 01:30:07,375
He killed them, Krithika.

1195
01:30:08,666 --> 01:30:09,916
Not me.

1196
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:13,750
It was him!
He killed them, Krithika.

1197
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,291
- Not me.
- Okay, Stephen. Sleep.

1198
01:30:17,375 --> 01:30:18,583
Let's talk tomorrow.

1199
01:30:20,625 --> 01:30:22,083
It wasn't me, Krithika.

1200
01:30:24,166 --> 01:30:25,583
He killed them.

1201
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,541
<i>She's lying, dude. She's a liar.
Why did you tell her?</i>

1202
01:30:35,625 --> 01:30:39,666
<i>You should've shut your mouth! As soon as
you fall asleep, she'll go to the police.</i>

1203
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:43,041
<i>We're going to jail. We're doomed forever.</i>

1204
01:30:47,166 --> 01:30:51,291
<i>Following that night,
my whole life was a blur.</i>

1205
01:30:52,708 --> 01:30:54,125
Krithika.

1206
01:30:54,208 --> 01:30:55,583
Can you take a week off?

1207
01:30:56,250 --> 01:30:57,125
What's wrong?

1208
01:30:57,208 --> 01:30:58,458
I'm not feeling well. That's why.

1209
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:01,916
Okay.

1210
01:31:28,041 --> 01:31:29,416
You scared me!

1211
01:31:30,291 --> 01:31:31,541
Where are you going?

1212
01:31:31,625 --> 01:31:35,291
To the office. There's a lot of pressure
as I didn't go for a week.

1213
01:31:35,375 --> 01:31:37,166
They're forcing me to come from today.

1214
01:31:41,125 --> 01:31:42,250
Krithika.

1215
01:31:43,375 --> 01:31:44,583
Let me drop you.

1216
01:31:52,416 --> 01:31:53,250
Let's go.

1217
01:32:45,125 --> 01:32:47,083
Hey! Did I scare you?

1218
01:32:48,916 --> 01:32:50,750
I'll take care of it.

1219
01:32:50,833 --> 01:32:52,416
Don't worry.
Dude.

1220
01:33:39,958 --> 01:33:43,916
<i>Even after all of this,
my Krithika believed in our love.</i>

1221
01:33:44,916 --> 01:33:48,541
<i>I know her since childhood, dude.
She's not like that.</i>

1222
01:33:48,625 --> 01:33:51,250
She promised
that she'll be there for us, right?

1223
01:33:51,333 --> 01:33:53,583
It's better we go to the police station.

1224
01:33:53,666 --> 01:33:55,375
Why are you punishing me
for your mistake?

1225
01:33:55,458 --> 01:33:57,208
You fool, how can I go inside her office?

1226
01:33:57,958 --> 01:34:00,291
It's nighttime. Please let me sleep.

1227
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,166
She's sleeping peacefully.

1228
01:34:03,250 --> 01:34:05,666
Why do you torture me,
saying she'll rat us out to the police?

1229
01:34:14,458 --> 01:34:16,541
I'm trying my best, Stephen.

1230
01:34:17,333 --> 01:34:18,875
But nothing is working out.

1231
01:34:19,583 --> 01:34:21,250
Can we consult a doctor?

1232
01:34:34,041 --> 01:34:37,208
<i>How dare she call us insane? Who's insane?
She's the one who needs therapy.</i>

1233
01:34:37,291 --> 01:34:39,833
<i>She's not our Krithika anymore.
She's pretending to deceive us!</i>

1234
01:34:39,916 --> 01:34:41,916
<i>Do you still trust her?
God knows what she's up to.</i>

1235
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,125
<i>Soon you'll learn your lesson!</i>

1236
01:34:47,750 --> 01:34:48,916
Let's not do this.

1237
01:34:51,333 --> 01:34:52,666
I'm really scared.

1238
01:34:53,583 --> 01:34:55,125
I don't want the pills.

1239
01:34:55,208 --> 01:34:56,291
I'm not crazy.

1240
01:34:56,916 --> 01:34:59,500
It's not normal to kill one's parents.

1241
01:35:00,875 --> 01:35:02,416
I can understand why you did it.

1242
01:35:03,083 --> 01:35:05,250
But you don't seem
to have come to terms with it.

1243
01:35:08,666 --> 01:35:10,083
So, I'm not normal to you?

1244
01:35:10,166 --> 01:35:11,000
Huh?

1245
01:35:11,625 --> 01:35:14,666
- Am I not normal?
- Sweetheart, you know I never said that.

1246
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:15,708
Then what is it?

1247
01:35:17,208 --> 01:35:20,750
You're not getting punished
on the outside for your crimes.

1248
01:35:20,833 --> 01:35:22,875
But your inner self is killing you.

1249
01:35:22,958 --> 01:35:24,000
Can't you see that?

1250
01:35:24,083 --> 01:35:25,250
Say what you want.

1251
01:35:25,333 --> 01:35:27,750
But please don't say
that my parents are normal.

1252
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,333
Their whole existence was a crime.
On top of that, they gave birth to me--

1253
01:35:32,416 --> 01:35:33,458
Stephen!

1254
01:35:34,458 --> 01:35:36,000
We have talked about this a million times.

1255
01:35:36,666 --> 01:35:38,625
We have to move forward from this.

1256
01:35:42,166 --> 01:35:44,250
Tell me if you are afraid.

1257
01:35:44,333 --> 01:35:46,666
I'll turn myself in for you.

1258
01:35:46,750 --> 01:35:47,833
Surrender?

1259
01:35:48,583 --> 01:35:50,583
What would I do without you?

1260
01:35:51,958 --> 01:35:53,458
I'm doing this for us, sweetheart.

1261
01:35:53,541 --> 01:35:54,666
No.

1262
01:35:54,750 --> 01:35:56,916
I can't. You are free to leave.

1263
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,458
- You can go.
- Stephen, Stephen.

1264
01:36:00,291 --> 01:36:01,125
Look.

1265
01:36:01,708 --> 01:36:03,583
Our love is enough to save us.

1266
01:36:05,208 --> 01:36:06,083
{\an8}- Let me go.
- Stephen.

1267
01:36:06,166 --> 01:36:07,583
{\an8}- Let me go.
- Stephen.

1268
01:36:07,666 --> 01:36:09,666
Come to me if you have faith in me.

1269
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:11,500
I'll be waiting for you.

1270
01:37:19,291 --> 01:37:21,166
Everything will be fine, Krithika.

1271
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:22,541
Trust me.

1272
01:37:22,625 --> 01:37:25,833
I'm getting better. I promise.

1273
01:37:44,416 --> 01:37:45,583
Stephen.

1274
01:37:48,750 --> 01:37:50,333
I'm really sick, dear.

1275
01:37:51,166 --> 01:37:53,375
Can I go and be with my grandma
for a day or two?

1276
01:37:58,916 --> 01:38:00,500
What are you going to do there?

1277
01:38:01,833 --> 01:38:03,208
I won't do anything.

1278
01:38:03,291 --> 01:38:04,708
I'll just be with Grandma.

1279
01:38:04,791 --> 01:38:06,458
You won't do anything, right?

1280
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,833
Then stay here and do nothing.

1281
01:38:11,916 --> 01:38:13,541
Why are you talking like this?

1282
01:38:13,625 --> 01:38:14,875
You must go?

1283
01:38:17,416 --> 01:38:19,833
Then accept the truth.

1284
01:38:19,916 --> 01:38:25,250
That you want to rat me out to the police
and hang me to death.

1285
01:38:25,916 --> 01:38:27,583
I swear it's not like that.

1286
01:38:27,666 --> 01:38:29,166
Will I ever lie to you, sweetheart?

1287
01:38:29,250 --> 01:38:31,791
Stop with your "sweetheart" bullshit.

1288
01:38:32,666 --> 01:38:33,833
Just accept it.

1289
01:38:33,916 --> 01:38:34,833
I'll let you go.

1290
01:38:35,666 --> 01:38:38,083
Accept it. I'll let you go.

1291
01:38:41,375 --> 01:38:43,875
Please, Stephen.

1292
01:38:46,166 --> 01:38:47,583
What are you doing?

1293
01:38:47,666 --> 01:38:49,500
What is all this drama?

1294
01:38:52,916 --> 01:38:54,458
I don't want any of this.

1295
01:38:55,750 --> 01:38:57,583
Say, "You are a mad killer."

1296
01:38:57,666 --> 01:38:59,208
"I can't be with you."

1297
01:38:59,291 --> 01:39:01,375
"I pretended to be in love with you."

1298
01:39:01,458 --> 01:39:03,125
"I'm going to rat you out."

1299
01:39:03,208 --> 01:39:04,458
Then I'll let you go.

1300
01:39:04,541 --> 01:39:05,750
No, nothing like that.

1301
01:39:05,833 --> 01:39:06,916
Stephen.

1302
01:39:09,250 --> 01:39:10,333
Accept it.

1303
01:39:11,125 --> 01:39:12,333
Then I'll let you go.

1304
01:39:18,041 --> 01:39:19,791
So, if I accept it, you'll let me go?

1305
01:39:21,208 --> 01:39:22,333
Yes, I will.

1306
01:39:43,250 --> 01:39:45,375
Okay, then.
Everything you said is true.

1307
01:39:46,291 --> 01:39:47,916
I'm going to the police.

1308
01:39:49,291 --> 01:39:50,500
Let me go.

1309
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:14,125
I trusted you so much.
How dare you?

1310
01:41:15,833 --> 01:41:18,041
Come on, cops. Come get me!

1311
01:41:46,083 --> 01:41:48,375
Krithika. Come here.

1312
01:41:52,250 --> 01:41:53,500
What?

1313
01:41:55,666 --> 01:41:58,208
I feel better now,
after leaving my past behind.

1314
01:42:01,333 --> 01:42:02,416
- Come.
- Hey.

1315
01:42:06,750 --> 01:42:07,708
Shall we get married?

1316
01:42:45,875 --> 01:42:49,666
I mistook the sirens.
I was wrong.

1317
01:43:11,041 --> 01:43:13,625
<i>She was the only good thing in my life.</i>

1318
01:43:14,833 --> 01:43:17,041
<i>The only one for me.</i>

1319
01:43:19,166 --> 01:43:23,875
<i>Killing her
was the biggest mistake of my life.</i>

1320
01:43:25,458 --> 01:43:28,958
<i>That's why I hid it for so long.</i>

1321
01:43:31,500 --> 01:43:36,208
I can never be with my Krithika anymore.

1322
01:43:39,250 --> 01:43:44,208
<i>That is the biggest punishment
anyone can give me.</i>

1323
01:43:48,250 --> 01:43:50,125
I lost control after that.

1324
01:43:54,750 --> 01:43:59,666
In search of Krithika's love,
I killed nine girls with my own hands.

1325
01:44:00,750 --> 01:44:05,083
But when Mary showed me that love,

1326
01:44:06,166 --> 01:44:07,500
<i>I realized...</i>

1327
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:11,166
I could never kill Mary.

1328
01:44:13,583 --> 01:44:19,208
That's why I dropped Mary at her house
and surrendered.

1329
01:44:22,625 --> 01:44:25,666
<i>I could have avoided
the suffering of countless families.</i>

1330
01:44:26,833 --> 01:44:29,791
<i>Mom, Dad, my Krithika...</i>

1331
01:44:30,750 --> 01:44:31,958
<i>and the nine girls...</i>

1332
01:44:32,583 --> 01:44:34,500
<i>I wish I never killed any of them.</i>

1333
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:42,166
<i>I could have lived a peaceful life
like everyone else.</i>

1334
01:44:45,458 --> 01:44:47,666
Look here, at your grandma, honey!

1335
01:44:52,375 --> 01:44:54,791
In the end,
I was far too gone to turn back.

1336
01:45:02,125 --> 01:45:03,791
<i>Seema. Seema.</i>

1337
01:45:03,875 --> 01:45:05,041
<i>Seema.</i>

1338
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,500
<i>Krithika only has a grandmother.</i>

1339
01:45:09,583 --> 01:45:12,833
Her parents passed away
when she was young.

1340
01:45:14,750 --> 01:45:17,916
Poor grandmother.
She's not able to grasp the situation.

1341
01:45:23,791 --> 01:45:25,250
What do you think, madam?

1342
01:45:26,250 --> 01:45:29,541
When we assessed as a team,
he seems stable now, Your Honor.

1343
01:45:30,708 --> 01:45:33,791
But he was unstable
during those murders.

1344
01:45:34,625 --> 01:45:39,458
I'm not sure whether
I pity Stephen or am angry at him.

1345
01:45:39,541 --> 01:45:41,458
Is he fit to stand trial?

1346
01:45:41,541 --> 01:45:42,541
Yes.

1347
01:45:44,208 --> 01:45:46,208
Does he need regular counseling?

1348
01:45:47,750 --> 01:45:49,125
Possibly, Your Honor.

1349
01:45:49,625 --> 01:45:54,041
People with a worse past
have led a normal life.

1350
01:45:54,125 --> 01:45:58,291
People with a normal past
have led a very violent life.

1351
01:45:58,375 --> 01:46:01,333
So the past and present are just reasons.

1352
01:46:02,333 --> 01:46:04,166
Does he have remorse?

1353
01:46:05,125 --> 01:46:06,125
Yes.

1354
01:46:06,791 --> 01:46:08,208
All right. You can go.

1355
01:46:14,166 --> 01:46:18,416
Depending on the choices and decisions
an individual makes,

1356
01:46:19,500 --> 01:46:22,500
he will be deemed good or bad.

1357
01:46:23,250 --> 01:46:25,708
According to the investigation

1358
01:46:25,791 --> 01:46:30,791
and reports submitted by Dr. Seema's team,

1359
01:46:30,875 --> 01:46:32,750
I'm about to hand my verdict.

1360
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:37,208
Court is a place to unravel the truth.

1361
01:46:37,291 --> 01:46:40,458
That's the sole purpose
of law and justice.

1362
01:46:40,541 --> 01:46:44,750
Such a place
cannot be used for revenge.

1363
01:46:45,375 --> 01:46:48,458
Forgiveness and love
help the world function.

1364
01:46:49,083 --> 01:46:54,333
Moreover, Stephen was mentally ill
at the time of the crimes,

1365
01:46:54,416 --> 01:46:59,000
and he shows deep remorse
for his wrongdoings.

1366
01:46:59,083 --> 01:47:00,583
I hereby sentence the accused Stephen

1367
01:47:00,666 --> 01:47:03,458
to a double life sentence.

1368
01:47:05,041 --> 01:47:08,208
I advise the prison administration
to pay attention to his mental health

1369
01:47:08,291 --> 01:47:12,791
and guide him on the right track.

1370
01:47:16,208 --> 01:47:17,333
Court dismissed.

1371
01:47:45,166 --> 01:47:47,250
WE WANT JUSTICE...!!

1372
01:47:50,416 --> 01:47:52,000
First, stop him!

1373
01:47:52,083 --> 01:47:53,375
Clear the way!

1374
01:47:54,041 --> 01:47:54,958
Please clear out!

1375
01:47:55,875 --> 01:47:57,291
Take cover. Take cover.

1376
01:47:58,625 --> 01:47:59,708
Cover up.

1377
01:48:01,458 --> 01:48:04,083
- Please move.
- Get him on the bus.

1378
01:48:04,166 --> 01:48:05,541
Get in. Get in. Get in.

1379
01:48:11,750 --> 01:48:13,791
Start the vehicle. Leave. Go. Go.

1380
01:48:17,416 --> 01:48:18,625
Please don't ask anything now.

1381
01:48:20,125 --> 01:48:22,000
Don't ask anything now, madam.

1382
01:48:22,083 --> 01:48:23,416
We can't comment now.

1383
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:25,416
Nothing can be said. Case is closed.

1384
01:48:26,875 --> 01:48:27,916
No comments, please.

1385
01:48:28,708 --> 01:48:30,166
The court has given its verdict.

1386
01:48:30,250 --> 01:48:32,750
We can't do anything. This is over.

1387
01:48:46,583 --> 01:48:51,250
{\an8}"THE END"
- WITH UTMOST SINCERITY, STEPHEN.

1388
01:48:51,333 --> 01:48:53,208
{\an8}<i>Hey, that's enough, dude.</i>

1389
01:48:54,458 --> 01:48:56,041
{\an8}You also join, dude.

1390
01:48:58,916 --> 01:49:00,041
Was it good?

1391
01:49:12,125 --> 01:49:13,375
Stephen.

1392
01:49:14,708 --> 01:49:16,208
You killed Kuttan, right?

1393
01:49:20,291 --> 01:49:22,583
Open your mouth and tell the truth.

1394
01:49:22,666 --> 01:49:24,958
Dad didn't kill Kuttan. Say it was you!

1395
01:49:33,166 --> 01:49:35,833
<i>I had a sudden urge to kill it.
Hence I did it.</i>

1396
01:49:36,958 --> 01:49:39,000
I made two big mistakes in my life.

1397
01:49:40,958 --> 01:49:43,916
Became an alcoholic
because I couldn't be a great player.

1398
01:49:44,666 --> 01:49:45,625
Then...

1399
01:49:46,250 --> 01:49:47,791
loving you unconditionally.

1400
01:49:58,708 --> 01:50:01,250
You were the one who set up the cameras
in the students' dressing room, right?

1401
01:50:04,250 --> 01:50:05,250
<i>Yes, it was me.</i>

1402
01:50:07,416 --> 01:50:10,333
<i>Sad! Dad took the blame for it.</i>

1403
01:50:10,416 --> 01:50:11,791
<i>But do you know something?</i>

1404
01:50:12,791 --> 01:50:15,166
<i>When I grew up,
I lost my interest in women.</i>

1405
01:50:15,875 --> 01:50:17,875
<i>My focus was only on killings.</i>

1406
01:50:19,750 --> 01:50:22,833
<i>You were killing cats and dogs
to satisfy your urge.</i>

1407
01:50:22,916 --> 01:50:25,000
<i>But soon, you turned towards humans.</i>

1408
01:50:26,083 --> 01:50:29,916
<i>Accept that you sliced up your mom,
who objected to it.</i>

1409
01:50:37,125 --> 01:50:42,291
<i>Also, accept that you threatened your dad
to confess and then slit his throat.</i>

1410
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:47,625
But why did you kill us?

1411
01:50:49,083 --> 01:50:50,333
What was our sin?

1412
01:50:52,166 --> 01:50:53,416
Speak up, you filthy dog!

1413
01:50:54,250 --> 01:50:56,291
Hey! Who was that?

1414
01:50:57,666 --> 01:50:59,083
Huh?

1415
01:50:59,166 --> 01:51:01,083
- You say it.
- Filthy dog.

1416
01:51:01,166 --> 01:51:02,041
Not you.

1417
01:51:02,125 --> 01:51:03,250
- You say it.
- Filthy dog.

1418
01:51:03,333 --> 01:51:04,583
- No. You?
- Filthy dog.

1419
01:51:04,666 --> 01:51:05,708
- No. You?
- Filthy dog.

1420
01:51:06,375 --> 01:51:07,208
Got you!

1421
01:51:07,958 --> 01:51:09,250
Huh?

1422
01:51:09,333 --> 01:51:11,250
I don't even remember your name.

1423
01:51:11,333 --> 01:51:13,375
And how dare you join with them
and call me names?

1424
01:51:14,375 --> 01:51:15,625
I'll thrash you.

1425
01:51:19,375 --> 01:51:21,958
First of all, whose family poisoned me?

1426
01:51:22,041 --> 01:51:22,875
Huh?

1427
01:51:23,458 --> 01:51:25,125
That too, in my favorite coffee.

1428
01:51:25,958 --> 01:51:29,416
Open your mouth, good-for-nothings.

1429
01:51:31,333 --> 01:51:33,958
You all wonder why I killed you?

1430
01:51:34,041 --> 01:51:35,916
Only then
will your souls find peace, right?

1431
01:51:36,875 --> 01:51:38,625
I missed Krithika at times.

1432
01:51:38,708 --> 01:51:42,166
<i>That's why I made you all
audition like her, and killed you.</i>

1433
01:51:42,250 --> 01:51:44,375
<i>How polite was I with you all!</i>

1434
01:51:44,458 --> 01:51:45,750
<i>Did I misbehave with any of you?</i>

1435
01:51:46,458 --> 01:51:48,083
Because I only find the thrill in killing.

1436
01:51:48,166 --> 01:51:51,208
I am not interested in anything else.
Understood?

1437
01:51:51,291 --> 01:51:53,291
You all are not important in my life.

1438
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,416
I'll be doing ten pushups now.

1439
01:51:59,208 --> 01:52:04,583
Make sure you all disappear
before I finish my set. Okay?

1440
01:52:06,375 --> 01:52:07,666
Please understand.

1441
01:52:09,416 --> 01:52:10,541
And don't annoy me.

1442
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:31,416
Dad? How's my form?

1443
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:34,666
Give your feedback, Dad.

1444
01:52:37,541 --> 01:52:40,208
Mom, talk to me.

1445
01:52:40,291 --> 01:52:41,708
You have all the rights.

1446
01:52:45,583 --> 01:52:46,916
Sweetheart?

1447
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:48,791
We used to talk for hours.

1448
01:52:49,583 --> 01:52:51,750
How come you're not saying anything?

1449
01:52:52,416 --> 01:52:54,000
Say something, dear.

1450
01:52:54,958 --> 01:52:59,708
Please move aside. Move.
Look at you!

1451
01:53:03,541 --> 01:53:08,958
When we were in the zone, I slipped up
slightly, and confessed to killing them.

1452
01:53:10,458 --> 01:53:11,666
<i>But you were like,</i>

1453
01:53:11,750 --> 01:53:15,125
<i>"Go, surrender, Stephen,
I'll wait for you."</i>

1454
01:53:15,208 --> 01:53:16,041
Really?

1455
01:53:16,875 --> 01:53:19,625
I've woven so many lies about Mom and Dad.

1456
01:53:19,708 --> 01:53:21,291
But you tried to lie to me?

1457
01:53:22,208 --> 01:53:23,958
That you were going to wait for me.

1458
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,416
So, I had to kill you too.

1459
01:53:28,333 --> 01:53:29,916
But go and ask others.

1460
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,541
You, me, our love...

1461
01:53:31,625 --> 01:53:34,291
I've sung songs about our love
and portrayed you like an angel.

1462
01:53:34,916 --> 01:53:36,708
There's a possibility
that you might've wings right now.

1463
01:53:36,791 --> 01:53:41,125
We raised you well.
How did you turn up like this?

1464
01:53:42,083 --> 01:53:44,958
Raised me well? Huh?

1465
01:53:45,791 --> 01:53:47,666
<i>I was beaten regularly.</i>

1466
01:53:47,750 --> 01:53:49,500
<i>But we did that to correct you.</i>

1467
01:53:49,583 --> 01:53:51,000
<i>But did that help?</i>

1468
01:53:52,625 --> 01:53:55,333
All the time, you both were picking on me.

1469
01:53:55,416 --> 01:53:58,166
That was kind of annoying.

1470
01:53:58,250 --> 01:54:01,125
So, I got rid of you both.

1471
01:54:02,791 --> 01:54:05,083
<i>Actually, I didn't plan to kill Daddy.</i>

1472
01:54:05,166 --> 01:54:07,583
<i>But what if he fumbles to the police?</i>

1473
01:54:07,666 --> 01:54:09,958
<i>So I slit his throat just to be safe.</i>

1474
01:54:10,041 --> 01:54:13,958
<i>But had I known that Moorthy would come
to the spot, I wouldn't have killed him.</i>

1475
01:54:14,041 --> 01:54:15,000
<i>Sorry Dad.</i>

1476
01:54:16,625 --> 01:54:20,166
Someone will definitely unravel
all the truths about you.

1477
01:54:20,250 --> 01:54:21,125
Wait and watch.

1478
01:54:22,083 --> 01:54:23,416
Who, Mom?

1479
01:54:23,500 --> 01:54:24,958
Seema?

1480
01:54:25,041 --> 01:54:26,958
Or Michael?

1481
01:54:29,750 --> 01:54:31,166
What is this, Mom?

1482
01:54:31,250 --> 01:54:32,708
Everything was a plan, Mom.

1483
01:54:34,916 --> 01:54:38,041
<i>Supposedly, if I had been caught
by the police after killing Mary,</i>

1484
01:54:38,125 --> 01:54:40,125
<i>they would've killed me on the spot.</i>

1485
01:54:40,208 --> 01:54:43,083
<i>This Michael would've put
a gun in my mouth.</i>

1486
01:54:43,166 --> 01:54:44,791
<i>They are "good" men.</i>

1487
01:54:44,875 --> 01:54:47,375
<i>That's why I made a plan to surrender.</i>

1488
01:54:47,958 --> 01:54:53,333
Then I wrote many tests, passed those,
convinced Seema, diverted her to Krithika,

1489
01:54:53,416 --> 01:54:55,625
made Michael run around,
brought Mary into the scene,

1490
01:54:55,708 --> 01:54:57,875
confused them, cleared them, and so on...

1491
01:54:57,958 --> 01:54:59,000
Good Lord!

1492
01:54:59,916 --> 01:55:02,583
Had to do too much homework.

1493
01:55:02,666 --> 01:55:04,458
Can anyone of you do this?

1494
01:55:04,541 --> 01:55:06,875
Tell me. Can you?

1495
01:55:06,958 --> 01:55:09,791
All you know is how to die.
Do you know how to survive?

1496
01:55:09,875 --> 01:55:10,875
You should know.

1497
01:55:10,958 --> 01:55:15,041
You should know how to play with emotions,
manipulate people, cheat, and survive.

1498
01:55:15,125 --> 01:55:16,541
You should know all those things!

1499
01:55:16,625 --> 01:55:19,000
Only then can you handle this cruel world.

1500
01:55:19,083 --> 01:55:22,208
The good people
will eventually end up like you all.

1501
01:55:22,875 --> 01:55:25,375
Even after all of my drama,
I was scared about the judge's verdict.

1502
01:55:25,458 --> 01:55:30,208
I was holding on to my dear life,
thinking what if he decides to hang me.

1503
01:55:30,291 --> 01:55:32,583
<i>Thank God.
He gave me double-life time.</i>

1504
01:55:34,541 --> 01:55:36,416
Jail life is not easy, Stephen.

1505
01:55:37,250 --> 01:55:38,666
Twenty-eight years!

1506
01:55:38,750 --> 01:55:41,250
Oh, you were waiting
all along to say this?

1507
01:55:41,333 --> 01:55:42,625
What is this, Dad?

1508
01:55:43,416 --> 01:55:44,541
Wait and watch,

1509
01:55:44,625 --> 01:55:47,791
I will be out in ten years,
based on my good behavior.

1510
01:55:47,875 --> 01:55:49,416
Now, my age is 25.

1511
01:55:49,500 --> 01:55:51,833
After 10 years, I'll be 35 or 36.

1512
01:55:51,916 --> 01:55:53,416
The point is,
I'll still be alive and kicking.

1513
01:55:53,500 --> 01:55:57,833
Will such a life bring you
happiness and peace, Stephen?

1514
01:55:57,916 --> 01:56:00,916
Did such a life bring you
happiness and peace, Krithika?

1515
01:56:01,791 --> 01:56:03,791
You're still as innocent as ever.

1516
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:06,458
Hey, Daddy. Take a hike, man.

1517
01:56:07,250 --> 01:56:08,750
What are you waiting for?

1518
01:56:08,833 --> 01:56:10,541
You think this bus will topple?

1519
01:56:10,625 --> 01:56:12,791
Nothing like that will happen.
Leave.

1520
01:56:12,875 --> 01:56:16,541
Then, don't you all forget.
I must be on my best behavior.

1521
01:56:16,625 --> 01:56:18,625
Don't try to trigger me inside the jail.

1522
01:56:19,583 --> 01:56:20,666
Krithika?

1523
01:56:22,041 --> 01:56:23,375
Would you have really waited for me?

1524
01:56:27,750 --> 01:56:29,958
Forget it.
What would I do with your answer now?

1525
01:56:30,041 --> 01:56:32,500
It's too late! It's too late!

1526
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:34,833
Leave, leave.

1527
01:56:34,916 --> 01:56:35,750
Go, go, go.

1528
01:56:43,875 --> 01:56:47,958
<i>If you think I'm crazy, maybe I am.</i>

1529
01:56:48,041 --> 01:56:50,291
CRAZY!

1530
01:56:50,375 --> 01:56:51,416
{\an8}<i>If you think I'm evil,
maybe I am.</i>

1531
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:52,333
{\an8}EVIL!

1532
01:56:55,458 --> 01:56:57,333
{\an8}<i>But for me, I'm just...</i>

1533
01:57:03,125 --> 01:57:07,458
<i>No matter how many times I say,
the fact remains true.</i>

1534
01:57:13,291 --> 01:57:15,916
<i>I've been wired like this.
What to do?</i>

1535
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:23,166
<i>Committing murder is a...</i>

1536
01:57:24,541 --> 01:57:26,166
<i>crime under the law.</i>

1537
01:58:07,875 --> 01:58:10,000
<i>Do not share this with anyone. All right?</i>

1538
01:58:27,541 --> 01:58:30,458
I still can't figure out
how he disposed of all the dead bodies.

1539
01:58:31,458 --> 01:58:33,583
What he said may be true indeed.

1540
01:58:34,583 --> 01:58:37,458
He may not know anything
besides throwing them in that forest.

1541
01:58:37,541 --> 01:58:39,666
We have been monitoring
that forest till now.

1542
01:58:40,375 --> 01:58:43,708
There's no unusual activity, also.
Not even wild animals.

1543
01:58:44,375 --> 01:58:49,000
{\an8}<i>In the second phase of the investigation
of the young women serial murder case,</i>

1544
01:58:49,083 --> 01:58:52,375
<i>as per the statement
of the serial killer, Stephen Jebaraj,</i>

1545
01:58:52,458 --> 01:58:56,250
<i>it is in the forests of Anaikadu,
near Sathyamangalam in Erode district,</i>

1546
01:58:56,333 --> 01:58:58,958
<i>where the bodies were disposed of.</i>

1547
01:58:59,041 --> 01:59:03,500
<i>Inspector Michael and team
rushed to the scene yesterday,</i>

1548
01:59:03,583 --> 01:59:07,791
<i>only to find no corpse
despite a thorough search.</i>

1549
01:59:07,875 --> 01:59:11,458
<i>Only a few ornaments
and evidences were found.</i>

1550
01:59:12,250 --> 01:59:16,250
<i>They belonged to the victims,
Surekha and Preethi.</i>

1551
01:59:16,333 --> 01:59:21,166
<i>SP George has ordered the public
and media not to go to the spot.</i>

1552
01:59:21,250 --> 01:59:25,166
<i>Questions have been raised
as to the veracity of the killer, Stephen.</i>

1553
01:59:25,250 --> 01:59:28,458
<i>Where exactly are the missing bodies?</i>

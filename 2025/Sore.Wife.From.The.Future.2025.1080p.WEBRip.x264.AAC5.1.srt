3
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:48,166
Do you know...

4
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,208
why dusk is so easy to love?

5
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:56,041
Sometimes it's red, blushing happily.

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,250
Sometimes it's black, dark and somber.

7
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,666
But the sky...

8
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:08,583
always accepts dusk as what it is.

9
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:34,666
See you.

10
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,125
Whether this world deserve us?

11
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,541
Do we pretend not to know,

12
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,958
or not really think about it?

13
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,791
Shy.

14
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,625
Hiding in the shadows,

15
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,208
lying the biggest lie that

16
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:56,916
we are the highest beings in all of creation.

17
00:05:58,708 --> 00:05:59,541
Oh...

18
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:00,916
you're practising.

19
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,625
Yes, I have an audition.

20
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Next week.

21
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,041
What if I told you...

22
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:07,625
Okay, tell me...

23
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,000
No, it's my monologue.

24
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,500
You don't have to answer.

25
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:11,416
What if I told you...

26
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,125
Why are you looking at me?

27
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,583
I need connection!

28
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:15,833
Man!

29
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:16,750
What if I told you...

30
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,583
Karlo, listen to me.

31
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:19,583
I'm thinking...

32
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,625
my next exhibition must be more explorative.

33
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,666
So, I need more time.

34
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:26,750
This is the material,

35
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,666
I'll send you the concept soon.

36
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,791
Okay?

37
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,083
No, no, no...

38
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,250
Please,

39
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,625
don't talk about climate change!

40
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,083
What are you?

41
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,041
A 13-year-old Scandinavian girl?

42
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,875
What's next? Pandas or kittens?

43
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:41,666
Trust me, Karlo.

44
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:42,416
No, you trust me!

45
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,625
They want something rare and unique.

46
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,041
This is rare.

47
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,375
Happy birthday.

48
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:49,958
Thank you.

49
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:53,708
It's your birthday?

50
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:54,916
Yes.

51
00:06:58,583 --> 00:06:59,583
I'm sorry.

52
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,333
So, that's the reason?

53
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:07,291
That's the reason with all this?

54
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:09,625
Cheers.

55
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:10,541
Yes, cheers.

56
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,541
Who knows? Maybe David likes pandas.

57
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:18,666
It's a polar bear.

58
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,458
No, this is an albino panda.

59
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,708
This is an all white...

60
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:27,416
See you soon...

61
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:31,041
See you soon...

62
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,416
See you soon, Karlo.

63
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,750
See you soon...

64
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:26,750
Hi.

65
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,250
Who are you?

66
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,041
I'm Sore.

67
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,500
Your wife from the future.

68
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,000
Karlo, what are you playing at?

69
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,250
Listen, I'm in the middle of rehearsal right now...

70
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:07,458
Are you crying?

71
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:08,916
No. What's up?

72
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:10,500
I told you,

73
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,458
I hate these so-called jokes.

74
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:14,416
How many times do I have to...

75
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,750
Hey! What...

76
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,291
What do you mean? What joke?

77
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,000
You think it's funny

78
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,416
to put a girl in my bed?

79
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:21,541
Or what?

80
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:22,541
You think I'll like it

81
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,083
because she's Indonesian?

82
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,750
I don't have time for this, Karlo!

83
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,416
Come on!

84
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:27,458
Jonathan...

85
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:28,833
What are you talking about?

86
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,166
She has nothing to do with me.

87
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,833
Look, I'm preparing for the casting...

88
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:35,833
also trying to think of a good reason for David...

89
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:39,333
to agree with your climate change idea.

90
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,208
I don't have time for this, either.

91
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:42,583
Are you crying?

92
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:43,666
No!

93
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:45,916
Stop this game right now!

94
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:46,916
It's not funny!

95
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,833
I hate people coming to my house.

96
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,333
What game? Are you drunk?

97
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:51,541
No, you're the drunk one.

98
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:52,958
You're so drunk you're crying!

99
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,541
No!

100
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,750
Yes, you are!

101
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,041
Tell her to leave,

102
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,041
and stop crying like a little baby!

103
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,208
I'm not crying.

104
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,625
Crying like a little baby,

105
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:05,583
that's a good idea.

106
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:07,500
Thank you.

107
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,208
Let's try again. Okay.

108
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,166
How much did Karlo pay you?

109
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:25,708
I'll double it.

110
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:33,625
Get out!

111
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,041
Okay.

112
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:13,833
Hey.

113
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,791
Don't forget your wallet and phone.

114
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,916
Be careful, don't walk too fast.

115
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,083
Sorry, I'm so sorry.

116
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:57,666
Sorry.

117
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:58,833
No problem.

118
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:10,958
Sorry, I'm late.

119
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:11,750
Are you okay?

120
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:13,708
Just great.

121
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,291
Karlo sent a girl to my house.

122
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:16,750
Like, right into my house.

123
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,000
Why would he do that?

124
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,875
His idea of a joke, I guess.

125
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:22,500
What did I tell you?

126
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,708
You need a new agent, a professional one.

127
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,000
I have nothing against Karlo personally...

128
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,166
Elsa.

129
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,833
Okay, look, Jo.

130
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,625
Last night I spoke to my dad.

131
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,833
And he agreed to help us out.

132
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,541
He wants to open a restaurant for me.

133
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,958
And you can come along with me.

134
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,666
He'll introduce you to his friends.

135
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,708
So, what do you think?

136
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:56,958
Oh...

137
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,916
You don't like it, do you?

138
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,333
So what exactly is your plan?

139
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,541
A solo exhibition?

140
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,791
Yeah.

141
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,291
Come on, Jo. You know it.

142
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:11,666
Don't treat me like your mother,

143
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm your girlfriend.

144
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,125
So, act like a grown man.

145
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,666
Do you think I like to keep asking you like this?

146
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,041
Then, stop asking.

147
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:20,458
Hi, Elsa.

148
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,791
I'm Sore.

149
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,291
Jonathan's wife.

150
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,958
Wife?

151
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:26,958
She's your wife?

152
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,000
No!

153
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,125
Please, leave now!

154
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,041
Don't trust her.

155
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:31,916
But I'm hungry.

156
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:33,625
You can eat somewhere else.

157
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,250
I want to eat here.

158
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:40,625
Here.

159
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,500
I'm paying you now.
Please leave.

160
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:51,958
I don't need your money.

161
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,416
I just want to eat.

162
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,125
Then find another table.

163
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,375
I want to eat here with you.
Am I not allowed?

164
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,208
No. I'm having a conversation!

165
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm asking you to leave now.

166
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,125
Jo.

167
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:03,625
Wait.

168
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,125
Why bother talking to Elsa?

169
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,583
You'll break up soon.

170
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,791
You don't want to go
with her to Madrid, right?

171
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,166
Work for his father...

172
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,791
Letting her boss you around...
Am I right?

173
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,458
Just tell her.
It'll be okay.

174
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:22,708
Yes,

175
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,250
He told me everything.

176
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:28,916
Sorry, he must've told you he's single.

177
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:30,041
Right?

178
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:34,250
We got married in Indonesia, and it's not the first time

179
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,416
he gets involved with a woman like you.

180
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:40,333
Well, as a wife,

181
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,458
I am expected to have patience.

182
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,375
Right?

183
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,333
Elsa, believe me.

184
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,291
He'll ask you to look him in the eye

185
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,833
so that you'll believe him.

186
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,125
He'll also blame Karlo.

187
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:57,333
Elsa...

188
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:01,208
Yes, he always says that when he's lying.

189
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,375
You'll get used to it.

190
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,166
Elsa.

191
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,083
Let her go.

192
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,000
Sorry.

193
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,000
Sorry!

194
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,541
Come on, you'll trip.

195
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:26,666
Sorry...

196
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:28,708
Sorry...

197
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:31,541
Stop!

198
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:32,916
Enough!

199
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,208
Go, or I'll call the police.

200
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:03,958
Hi.

201
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:09,958
What do you want?

202
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:26,666
Hi.

203
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:27,916
Hello, Jo.

204
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:29,916
For two, please.

205
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:30,833
Go ahead.

206
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,333
Hi...

207
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:44,416
Excuse me?

208
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:45,208
Enjoy.

209
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,041
Thank you.

210
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:46,916
You're welcome.

211
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:56,625
What's your name?

212
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:57,625
Sore.

213
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,375
Okay, Sore.

214
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:03,875
After this, we are done.

215
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,750
Tell Karlo this is not funny anymore.

216
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,250
Karlo has no idea.

217
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:15,583
Ask me.

218
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:17,958
Anything.

219
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,750
About you.

220
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:30,583
Karlo, we need to talk.

221
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,416
She knows everything about me.

222
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:34,250
Who?

223
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,333
Stop!

224
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:39,458
Sore.

225
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:40,416
It's fine.

226
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:41,250
Sore!

227
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,000
No problem.

228
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,166
Sore!

229
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,291
Her name is Sore.

230
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,125
Oh...

231
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:48,500
Guys, take five!

232
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:50,333
Come.

233
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,708
The girl I was upset about yesterday,

234
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,083
she claims she's from the future!

235
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:56,583
From the future?

236
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:57,708
She says she's my wife!

237
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:59,416
And she knows everything about me.

238
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,541
Every little detail of my life.

239
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,583
- What's my mother's name?
- Maya Wiryawan.

240
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:07,916
Born and raised in Surabaya.

241
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,916
She's one of 12 kids.

242
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,375
She's the second youngest child.

243
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,291
- My elder sibling?
- Sindy?

244
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,708
She's fine.

245
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,291
She should be busy
preparing her wedding now.

246
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:28,916
Three years from now,

247
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:31,708
when she gets married,
you'll go home, okay?

248
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,375
That's where you'll meet me.

249
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:46,833
My younger sibling?

250
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,833
You don't have any.

251
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,083
What else?

252
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:04,833
Your first girlfriend?

253
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,333
She has nothing to do with you?

254
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:11,875
No...

255
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,375
Really, I...

256
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,500
would be proud if I'd come up with the joke,

257
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,375
but...

258
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,625
I didn't.

259
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,208
Should we call someone?

260
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,208
Hi.

261
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:37,541
You're home.

262
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,458
I made you yellow broth chicken soup.

263
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,166
Your favorite.

264
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:46,666
I used local prawn crackers
for the savory powder, so...

265
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:47,333
Okay.

266
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,875
Let's say I believe you're from the future.

267
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:52,708
What do you want?

268
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,708
I want to make your life better.

269
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,250
My life is fine.

270
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:13,083
Come.

271
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:30,583
You'll see David tomorrow, right?

272
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:34,166
Don't show him the Arctic pictures.
He doesn't feel...

273
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:35,500
Sore, no.

274
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,250
That's the roll from Ladakh, right?

275
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:48,291
This one. Roll 14, frame 20...

276
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:49,625
Sorry.

277
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:50,833
Frame 29.

278
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:52,833
You said frame 28 is out of focus.

279
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:09,458
No one knows I took pictures there.

280
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,791
I do.

281
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:35,750
David will love the pictures of the lady
you met at the temple's door.

282
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,333
I know it sounds crazy.

283
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:43,916
But if you just have a little more patience,

284
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:46,375
you'll believe

285
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:49,875
that I really am from the future.

286
00:23:54,541 --> 00:23:55,250
Wow.

287
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,833
This is fantastic.

288
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:00,208
I like it very much.

289
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:00,750
Really?

290
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,666
Very much.

291
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:02,916
Let's do it!

292
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:03,916
Thank you.

293
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:04,958
Thank you.

294
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:05,708
Thank you.

295
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:07,958
It has great potential...

296
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,125
Cheers.

297
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:25,250
Now do you believe
I can make your life better?

298
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:37,458
From now on,

299
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:39,875
do whatever I tell you, okay?

300
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:45,291
Okay.

301
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:49,583
Promise?

302
00:24:57,625 --> 00:24:58,416
Promise.

303
00:24:58,958 --> 00:24:59,750
Whatever?

304
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:05,291
Yes.

305
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:08,791
Okay.

306
00:25:54,916 --> 00:25:55,458
Good morning.

307
00:25:55,458 --> 00:25:56,500
Hi.

308
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,875
What do you want?

309
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,750
Anything.

310
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:02,333
Seriously?

311
00:26:05,791 --> 00:26:07,500
Thank you.

312
00:26:48,166 --> 00:26:49,333
Let's exercise.

313
00:26:51,708 --> 00:26:52,833
Come on!

314
00:26:55,708 --> 00:26:56,375
Oh God.

315
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:02,458
Almost there! Look! Come on!

316
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:04,833
Come on, almost there.

317
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:14,000
Come on, a little further.

318
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,750
Easy for you to say.
I'm literally carrying you!

319
00:27:18,666 --> 00:27:20,666
Not far, I can see it.

320
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:23,000
Come on.

321
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:25,833
Oh God!

322
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:28,666
Why on Earth did I marry you?

323
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:33,041
When you grow to like me,
you'll be sorry.

324
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,416
Does this suit me?

325
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:54,041
Yes.

326
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:57,750
Okay.

327
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:15,083
Yes.

328
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:19,125
Oh my goodness!

329
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:20,541
So sorry...

330
00:28:20,541 --> 00:28:22,750
I didn't listen to Elsa's recommendation.

331
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,750
I spoke to an agent in Spain.

332
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,916
I told him I'm trying to make an exhibition in Madrid.

333
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:30,291
Great!

334
00:28:31,625 --> 00:28:32,958
Do you have any other photos

335
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:34,250
you think might be interesting?

336
00:28:41,916 --> 00:28:42,875
The Arctic.

337
00:28:43,583 --> 00:28:45,625
I recently just came back from the Arctic.

338
00:28:45,666 --> 00:28:47,625
Is it about climate change?

339
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,333
No. In a way...

340
00:28:49,833 --> 00:28:52,583
Do they always have to talk about that?

341
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:53,708
No, not that.

342
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:55,583
It's more complex than you think.

343
00:28:56,375 --> 00:28:58,125
But I'm curious to see from your perspective.

344
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,500
If it's more like this,

345
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,666
show it to me first.

346
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:03,500
No pressure.

347
00:29:07,541 --> 00:29:09,250
It's always the same topic...

348
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,541
Not this time.

349
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,583
Sorry, I answered right away.

350
00:29:16,291 --> 00:29:17,625
It's okay.

351
00:29:40,291 --> 00:29:41,291
What's this?

352
00:29:43,166 --> 00:29:44,166
Don't open it.

353
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:46,416
Huh?

354
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,666
Your correspondence with Elsa?

355
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,791
Don't open it.

356
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,458
- What is it?
- Don't open it!

357
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,916
Don't!

358
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:58,583
Jo! Cut it out!

359
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:02,875
- Don't open it!
- Jo! Stop it!

360
00:30:04,708 --> 00:30:06,791
Jo! Enough!

361
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:08,958
- Give it back!
- Jo! Stop it!

362
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,583
Jo! Stop!

363
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:12,958
- Give it back!
- I'll give it back!

364
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:15,166
I won't stop
until you give it back!

365
00:30:15,916 --> 00:30:17,833
Jo! Okay, I'll give it back!

366
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:19,291
You can have it!

367
00:30:47,666 --> 00:30:48,500
Jo...

368
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,291
Our first time...

369
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:04,166
was after we got married.

370
00:31:40,791 --> 00:31:42,458
You said

371
00:31:44,666 --> 00:31:46,125
you'd protect me

372
00:31:50,666 --> 00:31:52,458
even from yourself.

373
00:31:54,416 --> 00:31:55,416
I said that?

374
00:31:55,875 --> 00:31:56,875
Yes.

375
00:32:00,791 --> 00:32:02,333
Actually, I asked you to.

376
00:32:02,916 --> 00:32:06,750
I once told you.

377
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:13,166
I only want to have one relationship in my life.

378
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:16,375
If possible.

379
00:32:19,416 --> 00:32:22,041
And suddenly you promised...

380
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:26,416
to protect me.

381
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Eh...

382
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:34,375
But

383
00:32:35,958 --> 00:32:38,125
come to think of it,

384
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,416
I'm already your wife.

385
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,125
But you're not my husband yet.

386
00:32:49,666 --> 00:32:50,666
What are your thoughts

387
00:32:52,166 --> 00:32:53,166
on this?

388
00:32:58,375 --> 00:32:59,375
Nothing.

389
00:33:01,916 --> 00:33:02,916
Nevermind.

390
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:10,291
What am I sitting on?

391
00:33:12,916 --> 00:33:13,625
My book.

392
00:33:15,541 --> 00:33:16,958
Your book?

393
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:21,333
- Want me to tickle you again?
- No!

394
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,541
I gave it back.

395
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:29,458
What are you reading?

396
00:33:32,708 --> 00:33:34,875
"Climate: Change for the Life".

397
00:33:35,791 --> 00:33:36,750
Read it to me.

398
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:46,416
Hold on.

399
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:49,083
- Keep your eyes closed.
- Okay.

400
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:56,458
Can I open them now?

401
00:33:56,708 --> 00:33:57,416
Yes.

402
00:34:11,208 --> 00:34:12,208
In the future...

403
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,875
is Madrid exhibition a success?

404
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:21,958
I feel like something's missing.

405
00:34:30,166 --> 00:34:31,166
I think...

406
00:34:31,666 --> 00:34:32,666
it'll work.

407
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:49,708
I know what's missing.

408
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:52,000
What?

409
00:34:57,875 --> 00:35:02,208
Where are we going?
Why don't you just tell me?

410
00:35:07,291 --> 00:35:09,041
Say something. Jo!

411
00:35:09,583 --> 00:35:10,583
Where are we going?

412
00:35:41,458 --> 00:35:43,958
What if we drink
from an upside down thermos?

413
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,750
What would happen?

414
00:35:46,416 --> 00:35:48,250
I didn't notice.

415
00:35:57,583 --> 00:36:00,666
Jo!

416
00:36:01,791 --> 00:36:02,708
Come eat!

417
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,208
In a minute.

418
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:13,541
You have to eat.

419
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:17,666
One more picture.

420
00:36:18,958 --> 00:36:20,583
You haven't eaten anything all day.

421
00:36:24,625 --> 00:36:27,875
Wait. Can you stand right over there?

422
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,541
- Me?
- Yes.

423
00:36:36,166 --> 00:36:37,208
Just one picture.

424
00:36:37,916 --> 00:36:39,458
One, and then we eat.

425
00:36:39,541 --> 00:36:41,375
- Yes, stand over there...
- Promise?

426
00:36:41,416 --> 00:36:43,666
- Just one?
- Just one!

427
00:36:46,625 --> 00:36:47,333
Here?

428
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:49,750
Now, turn to your left.

429
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,125
Like this?

430
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:56,166
- Lose the ladle.
- You said one picture.

431
00:36:56,291 --> 00:36:58,333
Yes, but the ladle is distracting.

432
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:00,416
- Toss it over here.
- I toss, you catch, okay?

433
00:37:00,541 --> 00:37:01,708
Yes, toss it here.

434
00:37:03,541 --> 00:37:04,791
- Okay.
- You said you'd catch.

435
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:06,166
No, I didn't.

436
00:37:09,041 --> 00:37:09,708
Smile.

437
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,333
Okay, one, two...

438
00:37:14,041 --> 00:37:14,791
Can we eat now?

439
00:37:26,708 --> 00:37:28,750
I'm still thinking about today's sunset.

440
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:34,875
Will David like it?

441
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:40,208
Jo...

442
00:37:45,625 --> 00:37:46,458
Go to sleep.

443
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:09,541
Are you still thinking about it?

444
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,083
Throw it away.

445
00:39:18,958 --> 00:39:20,416
- Just this one.
- I said, throw it away.

446
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,833
- It's been two days. I said...
- Just this one, and that's it.

447
00:39:28,041 --> 00:39:29,916
I can't quit just like that.

448
00:39:32,458 --> 00:39:35,125
- Changing a habit takes time.
- That's not true.

449
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:40,500
Slowly, you said?
I tried it, and I failed.

450
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:47,083
Every time I let you have that one time,

451
00:39:47,083 --> 00:39:50,250
you get further away from quitting,
getting more stubborn!

452
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:11,208
Let's start over.

453
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:14,333
- It's just this one time.
- No.

454
00:40:15,083 --> 00:40:16,083
It's fine.

455
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:17,875
We'll start over.

456
00:40:23,833 --> 00:40:25,250
This is not the first time.

457
00:40:26,708 --> 00:40:27,708
It's fine.

458
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:31,083
Okay?

459
00:40:41,458 --> 00:40:43,041
Eight years from now...

460
00:40:44,541 --> 00:40:45,833
you'll be dead.

461
00:40:48,166 --> 00:40:49,416
A heart attack.

462
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:56,791
Sore. Your nose...

463
00:41:01,916 --> 00:41:02,666
Sore.

464
00:41:07,208 --> 00:41:09,333
Sore!

465
00:41:10,041 --> 00:41:13,250
Sore! Hey!

466
00:41:14,666 --> 00:41:17,000
Sore, what's happening?

467
00:41:19,541 --> 00:41:21,250
Sore!

468
00:41:33,541 --> 00:41:36,750
If I have to live ten thousand times,

469
00:41:38,208 --> 00:41:40,333
I hope I'll always choose you.

470
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:23,333
Who are you?

471
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,250
I...

472
00:42:51,708 --> 00:42:52,708
I'm Sore.

473
00:42:56,666 --> 00:42:58,666
Your wife from the future.

474
00:43:28,291 --> 00:43:29,083
You think I'll like it

475
00:43:29,083 --> 00:43:30,541
because she's Indonesian?

476
00:43:30,666 --> 00:43:32,041
I don't have time for this, Karlo.

477
00:43:32,041 --> 00:43:33,041
Come on!

478
00:43:33,666 --> 00:43:36,166
How much did Karlo pay you?
I'll double it.

479
00:43:41,833 --> 00:43:42,833
Get out!

480
00:43:57,125 --> 00:43:57,916
Okay.

481
00:44:02,083 --> 00:44:02,958
Hey.

482
00:44:04,333 --> 00:44:06,208
Don't forget your wallet and phone.

483
00:44:16,333 --> 00:44:17,458
Be careful, you'll...

484
00:44:18,833 --> 00:44:19,833
Sorry.

485
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,833
Hi, Elsa.

486
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:25,416
I'm Sore, Jonathan's wife.

487
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:31,791
Let her go.

488
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:34,583
Come on, you'll trip.

489
00:44:58,791 --> 00:44:59,666
Stop!

490
00:45:00,708 --> 00:45:03,416
Enough! Go, or I'll call the police.

491
00:45:04,541 --> 00:45:05,708
What do you want?

492
00:45:08,916 --> 00:45:10,291
Actually, he can't drink beer.

493
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:11,333
Can you help me out?

494
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:17,250
You had your first cigarette in first grade,
in the school's bathroom at recess.

495
00:45:18,083 --> 00:45:21,500
Let's say I believe you're from the future,
what do you want?

496
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,208
I want to make your life better.

497
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:25,500
My life is fine.

498
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:29,333
From now on,
do whatever I tell you, okay?

499
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:31,500
Promise?

500
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:46,750
Why on Earth did I marry you?

501
00:45:46,916 --> 00:45:48,458
When you grow to like me,
you'll be sorry.

502
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:51,708
Enough with today's work.

503
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:53,541
Go to sleep.

504
00:45:54,791 --> 00:45:56,708
I can't sleep before I finish.

505
00:46:27,166 --> 00:46:28,041
Sore!

506
00:46:28,041 --> 00:46:31,125
If you want to die first,
fine, stop listening to me!

507
00:46:32,208 --> 00:46:33,791
Sore! Hey!

508
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:39,375
Did you forget your promise?

509
00:46:40,708 --> 00:46:42,250
Let's start over.

510
00:46:42,916 --> 00:46:44,083
Just one...

511
00:46:44,416 --> 00:46:45,791
Sore!

512
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:52,916
Why is it so hard to listen to me?
I told you!

513
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,458
No one orders me around,
not even my wife!

514
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:01,750
Sore!

515
00:47:03,083 --> 00:47:04,208
My negatives are ruined!

516
00:47:04,333 --> 00:47:05,541
I said, go to sleep!

517
00:47:08,166 --> 00:47:09,041
I'm Sore.

518
00:47:11,666 --> 00:47:12,708
Your wife

519
00:47:13,875 --> 00:47:15,708
from the future.

520
00:47:25,041 --> 00:47:26,083
Are you enjoying it?

521
00:47:30,541 --> 00:47:31,666
Is it worth it?

522
00:47:34,166 --> 00:47:35,958
- Changing a habit takes time...
- Yes.

523
00:47:38,291 --> 00:47:40,458
If you don't want to change,

524
00:47:40,916 --> 00:47:41,625
okay.

525
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:43,125
It's fine.

526
00:47:47,458 --> 00:47:49,708
I will stay out of your life

527
00:47:54,125 --> 00:47:56,625
I'm just asking one thing from you.

528
00:48:00,291 --> 00:48:03,958
Don't come anywhere near me.

529
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,458
Don't introduce yourself to me
at Sindy's wedding.

530
00:48:07,875 --> 00:48:11,250
Don't ever come into my life,
and make me have feelings for you,

531
00:48:11,291 --> 00:48:14,375
only to watch you die first
and leave me behind!

532
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:32,125
I was wrong.

533
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:38,875
I should've accepted that
people don't change.

534
00:49:45,625 --> 00:49:49,583
You speak fluent Croatian,
how long did it take you to learn?

535
00:49:50,666 --> 00:49:53,125
Maybe hundreds of years...

536
00:49:57,083 --> 00:49:58,833
How old are you now?

537
00:49:59,083 --> 00:50:01,208
How old?

538
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,666
A hundred something?
I forgot.

539
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:09,458
Really?

540
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,166
No wonder you're fluent.

541
00:50:33,666 --> 00:50:36,875
If I have to live ten thousand times,

542
00:50:38,375 --> 00:50:40,500
I hope I'll always choose you.

543
00:50:47,416 --> 00:50:48,500
Meaning?

544
00:50:49,583 --> 00:50:50,625
Meaning?

545
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:53,375
Good night.

546
00:51:19,666 --> 00:51:21,375
Hello.

547
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:25,541
Want to try something with truffle?

548
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,125
I sell truffle products.

549
00:51:28,291 --> 00:51:30,416
No...

550
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:32,541
I'm looking for a job.

551
00:51:33,166 --> 00:51:34,166
Sorry.

552
00:51:34,666 --> 00:51:37,666
We have no vacancy.

553
00:51:37,791 --> 00:51:40,083
Sorry, but we're not hiring.

554
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,750
But I will work hard,

555
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:45,125
just pay me what you can.

556
00:51:45,166 --> 00:51:47,583
Sorry, I really can't help you.

557
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,500
So sorry.

558
00:51:50,666 --> 00:51:51,541
It's all right.

559
00:51:51,833 --> 00:51:54,875
Listen, I understand.

560
00:51:54,958 --> 00:51:55,625
I like you,

561
00:51:55,625 --> 00:51:57,166
but I can't give you a job.

562
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:03,291
It's all right.

563
00:52:03,375 --> 00:52:04,375
Thank you.

564
00:52:13,791 --> 00:52:14,791
Wait.

565
00:52:16,291 --> 00:52:18,083
You said you're a fashion designer?

566
00:52:19,333 --> 00:52:20,208
Yes.

567
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:23,666
My friend owns a bridal shop in Zagreb.

568
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,250
Maybe he needs an intern.

569
00:52:27,541 --> 00:52:28,583
I'm going to Zagreb today.

570
00:52:28,583 --> 00:52:30,125
You can come with me, if you want.

571
00:52:59,083 --> 00:53:00,083
Hello!

572
00:53:01,375 --> 00:53:02,416
Marko!

573
00:53:04,708 --> 00:53:05,708
Wait here.

574
00:53:08,583 --> 00:53:09,583
Come on, that's enough.

575
00:53:10,166 --> 00:53:11,708
I told you

576
00:53:11,708 --> 00:53:15,583
not to listen to your friend's recommendation.

577
00:53:16,125 --> 00:53:17,000
He was a know-it-all.

578
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,500
Look at you now. See?

579
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:21,125
You look like a lamp. Everything is tilted.

580
00:53:22,625 --> 00:53:25,583
We shouldn't have listened to him.

581
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:32,875
Hey, you!

582
00:53:34,208 --> 00:53:35,208
Where's Marko?

583
00:53:36,833 --> 00:53:37,833
I...

584
00:53:37,875 --> 00:53:39,583
I want our money back.

585
00:53:39,625 --> 00:53:40,625
This unacceptable

586
00:53:40,625 --> 00:53:41,833
and unprofessional.

587
00:53:41,875 --> 00:53:43,083
Come on, Mom. Calm down.

588
00:53:43,125 --> 00:53:45,541
You want to see?

589
00:53:46,083 --> 00:53:47,083
Come, see for yourself.

590
00:53:50,166 --> 00:53:51,750
Look at your boss' work.

591
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:54,125
Now I have to find another designer.

592
00:53:54,458 --> 00:53:57,416
Because everything is asymmetrical.

593
00:53:57,458 --> 00:53:59,458
The fabric is hanging on this side.

594
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:03,375
Go take a look!

595
00:54:04,125 --> 00:54:06,500
Sorry, can you stand straight?

596
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,500
Okay.

597
00:54:10,791 --> 00:54:13,000
Now stand on your toes.

598
00:54:17,541 --> 00:54:18,583
You have to wear high heels

599
00:54:18,583 --> 00:54:19,750
with this dress.

600
00:54:21,208 --> 00:54:22,083
When you sleep,

601
00:54:22,083 --> 00:54:23,958
which side do you sleep on?

602
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:24,791
Your left side?

603
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,833
How did you know?

604
00:54:28,125 --> 00:54:30,000
There's nothing wrong with the dress.

605
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,500
If you're not comfortable,

606
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,666
we can adjust on this side.

607
00:54:34,666 --> 00:54:39,083
But you are beautiful already.

608
00:54:42,583 --> 00:54:43,583
Is that her?

609
00:54:44,583 --> 00:54:45,375
Yes.

610
00:54:45,625 --> 00:54:47,333
Okay, she's very good.

611
00:54:49,833 --> 00:54:51,041
Listen, I will deduct your rent

612
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:52,333
from your salary.

613
00:54:52,333 --> 00:54:54,000
Are you okay with it?

614
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,875
Sure. No problem.

615
00:55:00,583 --> 00:55:02,125
Sorry, the place is a mess.

616
00:55:05,291 --> 00:55:06,291
It's fine.

617
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:10,375
Where's your stuff?

618
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:13,208
Uhm...

619
00:55:19,125 --> 00:55:20,750
You're such a mess.

620
00:55:22,791 --> 00:55:25,041
Don't laugh.

621
00:55:25,291 --> 00:55:27,208
Your love is stupid.

622
00:55:30,958 --> 00:55:32,041
Thank you.

623
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:37,250
Hello, Marko.

624
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:38,416
Hi, Sore.

625
00:57:45,916 --> 00:57:46,625
Coffee?

626
00:57:46,625 --> 00:57:48,083
Thanks, darling.

627
00:58:01,875 --> 00:58:03,083
Marko!

628
00:58:03,083 --> 00:58:04,750
Hi, Elsa!

629
00:58:05,791 --> 00:58:07,375
I opened the door the wrong way.

630
00:58:08,916 --> 00:58:10,833
Hi, darling. You look beautiful.

631
00:58:10,833 --> 00:58:13,000
And you look great, as usual.

632
00:58:13,958 --> 00:58:14,875
By the way,

633
00:58:14,875 --> 00:58:17,083
I loved the dress I wore.

634
00:58:17,125 --> 00:58:19,000
It looked amazing in the pictures.

635
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,416
I'll send them to you.

636
00:58:20,416 --> 00:58:25,125
But I'm here today...

637
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:26,416
because I'm getting married.

638
00:58:26,416 --> 00:58:27,291
This is Jonathan.

639
00:58:27,333 --> 00:58:28,375
Hi, I'm Jonathan.

640
00:58:28,375 --> 00:58:28,833
Marko...

641
00:58:29,333 --> 00:58:31,208
He'll have his suit tailored here.

642
00:58:31,208 --> 00:58:33,375
I'm looking for a wedding dress.

643
00:58:33,625 --> 00:58:34,708
I have to do measurements.

644
00:58:34,708 --> 00:58:35,458
Yes.

645
00:58:36,875 --> 00:58:37,583
Sore!

646
00:58:38,583 --> 00:58:39,083
Yes?

647
00:58:39,375 --> 00:58:40,666
Do his measurements.

648
00:58:51,208 --> 00:58:53,375
Sorry, please stand here.

649
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:45,041
Sorry.

650
01:00:14,916 --> 01:00:15,958
Listen.

651
01:00:16,083 --> 01:00:18,000
I've seen it many times.

652
01:00:18,791 --> 01:00:20,166
A young woman like you

653
01:00:20,166 --> 01:00:21,958
wouldn't survive this period.

654
01:00:23,666 --> 01:00:24,666
Period?

655
01:00:24,958 --> 01:00:26,625
The broken heart period.

656
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,416
It's not that, Marko...

657
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:36,250
Sore, there are three things  you can't change

658
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:37,875
in this life.

659
01:00:38,083 --> 01:00:40,291
The past, pain, and death.

660
01:00:42,291 --> 01:00:46,125
I just want my employee to focus, okay?

661
01:00:48,916 --> 01:00:51,333
You'd better turn a new leaf.

662
01:00:51,625 --> 01:00:52,625
Move on!

663
01:00:59,958 --> 01:01:02,291
No excuse for this childish behavior.

664
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:02,833
Grow up!

665
01:01:02,916 --> 01:01:03,958
Do you want this or not?

666
01:01:07,541 --> 01:01:09,750
Listen, I'm tired.

667
01:01:11,541 --> 01:01:13,375
Do you want this or not?

668
01:01:13,375 --> 01:01:14,333
What do you want?

669
01:01:14,708 --> 01:01:16,250
You want to act like this forever?

670
01:01:16,958 --> 01:01:18,916
Listen, I'm tired of acting like your mom.

671
01:01:18,916 --> 01:01:20,583
Telling what you have to do every time.

672
01:01:21,083 --> 01:01:22,583
Send your freakin' mail.

673
01:01:23,708 --> 01:01:26,125
Your dad lives just a couple of kilometers from here.

674
01:01:26,166 --> 01:01:27,791
You don't even have the courage

675
01:01:27,791 --> 01:01:28,791
to meet him!

676
01:01:29,333 --> 01:01:30,333
And...

677
01:01:30,875 --> 01:01:32,416
don't act like a victim.

678
01:01:33,541 --> 01:01:34,875
You're mad at your dad,

679
01:01:34,875 --> 01:01:36,208
but you blame it on me.

680
01:01:40,416 --> 01:01:42,083
I'm tired.

681
01:01:44,375 --> 01:01:45,416
Okay, Jo.

682
01:01:45,625 --> 01:01:46,625
You know what...

683
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
it's up to you.

684
01:01:53,291 --> 01:01:54,291
I give up.

685
01:02:03,833 --> 01:02:04,416
Bye.

686
01:02:04,416 --> 01:02:06,416
Bye, Elsa. Let me know.

687
01:02:30,625 --> 01:02:31,625
Marko?

688
01:02:32,625 --> 01:02:33,666
Yes?

689
01:02:35,125 --> 01:02:37,458
You said the past, pain, and death...

690
01:02:37,458 --> 01:02:40,791
can't be changed, right?

691
01:02:40,833 --> 01:02:42,000
Yes, that's what I said.

692
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:51,500
So, you believe people can change?

693
01:02:54,166 --> 01:02:56,166
Of course people can change.

694
01:02:56,333 --> 01:02:58,500
But,

695
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,791
the change must come from within.

696
01:03:01,041 --> 01:03:03,166
Some people have trouble making peace

697
01:03:03,166 --> 01:03:04,791
with their pain and trauma.

698
01:03:04,791 --> 01:03:06,125
But they can change.

699
01:03:06,666 --> 01:03:07,791
Wait, Sore...

700
01:03:08,958 --> 01:03:10,666
Is it him?

701
01:03:40,708 --> 01:03:42,791
Thank you for everything, Marko.

702
01:04:28,666 --> 01:04:30,458
- I'M IN ZAGREB.
- JO

703
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:43,833
IF I COULD TURN BACK TIME,
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE MET MOM. - JO

704
01:04:56,375 --> 01:04:57,833
- IT'S MY BIRTHDAY, REMEMBER?
- JO

705
01:04:57,833 --> 01:05:01,125
- ARE YOU HAPPIER NOW, DAD?
- JO

706
01:05:08,708 --> 01:05:11,791
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DAD.
- JO

707
01:05:22,333 --> 01:05:25,916
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU STILL CARE,
BUT I SHOULDN'T BE HERE. - JO

708
01:05:31,291 --> 01:05:33,166
Why haven't I opened this?

709
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:46,416
Jo! Wait, listen to me.

710
01:05:47,583 --> 01:05:50,083
I'm Sore, your wife from the future.

711
01:05:51,208 --> 01:05:52,791
Karlo didn't send me.

712
01:05:57,875 --> 01:06:00,666
In the dark room, second drawer
from the bottom right...

713
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:03,208
roll number 14, frame number 29.

714
01:06:03,208 --> 01:06:04,625
You took pictures of the lady in Ladakh,

715
01:06:04,625 --> 01:06:06,791
no one knew you took pictures there,
but I do.

716
01:06:13,458 --> 01:06:14,875
Let's go see your dad.

717
01:06:22,708 --> 01:06:24,916
You've been writing these
for a long time, right?

718
01:06:47,333 --> 01:06:49,666
Jo!

719
01:06:49,708 --> 01:06:51,208
- Jo!
- Hey!

720
01:06:51,458 --> 01:06:54,291
Listen to me.
Calm down, listen to me.

721
01:06:54,833 --> 01:06:58,333
I know you've been writing these
for a long time. Right?

722
01:06:58,416 --> 01:06:59,916
Now think it through.

723
01:06:59,916 --> 01:07:04,125
What if you go back home,
without ever seeing your dad...

724
01:07:04,625 --> 01:07:05,666
You'll be sorry, right?

725
01:07:05,666 --> 01:07:06,708
You'll regret it.

726
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:09,125
So, you'd better come with me.
We'll...

727
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:26,583
We'll contact you.

728
01:07:48,625 --> 01:07:49,958
Must I start over?

729
01:07:55,458 --> 01:07:56,500
Who are you?

730
01:08:01,125 --> 01:08:02,125
Maybe start from there?

731
01:08:03,541 --> 01:08:04,375
Okay.

732
01:08:05,166 --> 01:08:06,166
One at a time.

733
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:08,333
From the start.

734
01:08:09,291 --> 01:08:10,291
Hey!

735
01:08:10,333 --> 01:08:11,333
Do you hear me?

736
01:08:20,208 --> 01:08:21,250
Hi.

737
01:08:26,833 --> 01:08:29,291
Sorry...

738
01:08:37,833 --> 01:08:41,375
You're always uncomfortable
talking about your dad.

739
01:08:44,208 --> 01:08:45,375
You always avoid it.

740
01:08:47,541 --> 01:08:49,583
Hi, you're home.

741
01:08:49,666 --> 01:08:51,333
I want to make your life better.

742
01:08:52,875 --> 01:08:53,958
Whatever?

743
01:08:54,291 --> 01:08:55,666
Don't open it!

744
01:08:55,958 --> 01:08:57,625
- I see.
- Give it back!

745
01:08:57,666 --> 01:08:59,666
- Don't open it!
- Jo!

746
01:09:00,125 --> 01:09:01,875
I'm still thinking about today's sunset.

747
01:09:03,625 --> 01:09:04,291
Come eat.

748
01:09:36,208 --> 01:09:37,083
Hey.

749
01:09:42,291 --> 01:09:43,708
We're going to Zagreb tomorrow.

750
01:09:45,416 --> 01:09:46,416
To see your dad.

751
01:09:48,791 --> 01:09:50,208
So you won't regret anything.

752
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:54,500
No regrets.

753
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:59,000
Yo've been living here because
your dad lives in Zagreb, right?

754
01:09:59,125 --> 01:10:00,166
You'll never understand.

755
01:10:00,291 --> 01:10:01,750
Then, let's talk about it.

756
01:10:03,291 --> 01:10:04,625
Let's talk.

757
01:10:05,083 --> 01:10:07,625
If we don't talk about it,
how can I understand?

758
01:10:07,625 --> 01:10:11,125
- Nothing to talk about.
- You want to see your dad, not me.

759
01:10:13,583 --> 01:10:16,041
If not, why have you been living in Croatia?

760
01:10:18,625 --> 01:10:21,666
Whether you want to stay angry
or forgive him,

761
01:10:21,708 --> 01:10:23,375
it's your choice.

762
01:10:27,833 --> 01:10:29,291
He chose someone else.

763
01:10:31,875 --> 01:10:33,250
I was four.

764
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:35,375
My sister Sindy was six.

765
01:10:38,291 --> 01:10:41,916
He married another woman,
abandoning us, can one forgive that?

766
01:10:45,375 --> 01:10:47,791
Now you ask me to choose?

767
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:59,208
What kind of person left his wife
and kids for his own pleasure?

768
01:11:00,875 --> 01:11:01,875
Huh?

769
01:11:03,291 --> 01:11:04,291
What kind of person?

770
01:11:13,291 --> 01:11:14,958
A person like you.

771
01:11:21,458 --> 01:11:22,916
You're just like your dad.

772
01:11:26,333 --> 01:11:29,791
You die, leaving me behind,
just for things you like to do.

773
01:11:29,833 --> 01:11:32,000
How are you different from him?

774
01:11:50,791 --> 01:11:53,000
How long will you stay angry?

775
01:11:58,583 --> 01:11:59,375
Sore!

776
01:12:16,125 --> 01:12:17,875
If it has to be that way,

777
01:12:19,458 --> 01:12:21,125
let my failure in life...

778
01:12:21,125 --> 01:12:22,333
balances...

779
01:12:22,583 --> 01:12:25,375
my success...

780
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:27,625
in another version.

781
01:12:31,666 --> 01:12:35,125
There's no such things as parallel lives.

782
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,291
Parallel worlds are just

783
01:12:43,291 --> 01:12:45,291
manifestations of human arrogance.

784
01:12:48,333 --> 01:12:49,916
How arrogant we are,

785
01:12:49,916 --> 01:12:52,125
when we think we can conquer time.

786
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:59,166
Do we think that by time travelling

787
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:01,083
and making different choices,

788
01:13:01,083 --> 01:13:03,583
the parallel life will exist?

789
01:13:08,625 --> 01:13:10,083
We know nothing about time.

790
01:13:14,083 --> 01:13:15,125
What is it?

791
01:13:18,583 --> 01:13:19,583
Who are you?

792
01:13:22,333 --> 01:13:23,333
Hi, Karlo.

793
01:13:24,875 --> 01:13:25,875
I'm Sore.

794
01:13:26,875 --> 01:13:27,875
Jonathan's wife.

795
01:13:30,583 --> 01:13:32,708
I come from the future.

796
01:13:47,083 --> 01:13:49,333
Elsa has asked him many times

797
01:13:49,333 --> 01:13:50,791
to see his dad.

798
01:13:54,458 --> 01:13:55,958
But you have to know...

799
01:13:57,833 --> 01:13:58,916
I think Elsa is trying

800
01:13:58,916 --> 01:13:59,791
to control Jonathan.

801
01:14:00,541 --> 01:14:01,916
She meddles in his work.

802
01:14:01,958 --> 01:14:03,333
Even I, as his agent...

803
01:14:03,583 --> 01:14:06,916
respect his choices.

804
01:14:08,833 --> 01:14:10,541
I mean, what do you expect?

805
01:14:10,541 --> 01:14:12,875
He's a man with many scars.

806
01:14:13,458 --> 01:14:14,500
I don't know

807
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,958
if Elsa loves him...

808
01:14:17,125 --> 01:14:19,500
or she's just obsessed to change him.

809
01:14:25,083 --> 01:14:27,041
That's why Jo never changes...

810
01:14:29,833 --> 01:14:32,875
I'm just replacing Elsa,
controlling his life.

811
01:14:35,791 --> 01:14:36,791
Sorry?

812
01:14:42,625 --> 01:14:43,583
Nevermind.

813
01:14:48,791 --> 01:14:51,000
Listen, no one understands him better than you.

814
01:14:52,833 --> 01:14:53,875
You're his wife.

815
01:15:10,041 --> 01:15:10,833
Thank you.

816
01:15:13,291 --> 01:15:15,541
Hey, can I borrow your time machine

817
01:15:15,541 --> 01:15:16,583
for a short time?

818
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:21,666
I don't have a Time Machine.

819
01:15:27,333 --> 01:15:28,333
I'm sorry.

820
01:15:28,583 --> 01:15:30,083
For forcing you to exercise.

821
01:15:33,333 --> 01:15:34,833
What other plans do you have?

822
01:15:34,916 --> 01:15:36,166
No plans.

823
01:15:40,416 --> 01:15:42,375
Besides, all my plans have failed.

824
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:50,916
I can't make your life better.

825
01:15:55,958 --> 01:15:57,250
Only you can do it.

826
01:16:05,458 --> 01:16:06,458
But...

827
01:16:08,750 --> 01:16:11,041
I would be so happy

828
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:13,250
if I could just be there with you.

829
01:16:18,291 --> 01:16:19,291
If you'd let me.

830
01:16:29,708 --> 01:16:30,708
You were once

831
01:16:31,875 --> 01:16:34,125
so angry with me.

832
01:16:35,041 --> 01:16:37,833
Because I forced you to see your dad.

833
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,000
I'm sorry.

834
01:16:48,708 --> 01:16:50,291
Did I tell you about him?

835
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,333
Remember, I'm from the future.

836
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,666
But because you were angry,

837
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:09,250
I got to understand

838
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:11,000
your feelings.

839
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:21,291
You said...

840
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,916
You feel your dad chose
someone else over you.

841
01:17:31,833 --> 01:17:34,541
But you don't choose yourself, either.

842
01:17:50,625 --> 01:17:52,166
You must be so miserable.

843
01:17:56,541 --> 01:17:57,875
For years...

844
01:17:59,958 --> 01:18:02,375
you chose to imprison
your dad in his mistakes,

845
01:18:02,375 --> 01:18:04,916
rather than setting yourself free.

846
01:18:21,958 --> 01:18:22,916
Okay?

847
01:18:26,875 --> 01:18:28,166
Whenever you're ready,

848
01:18:31,291 --> 01:18:32,250
I'm here.

849
01:19:09,583 --> 01:19:10,833
What's wrong?

850
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:15,708
Nothing.

851
01:19:26,666 --> 01:19:28,041
Is our marriage a happy one?

852
01:19:29,041 --> 01:19:30,458
You are so nice to me.

853
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:36,416
Actually, we fight quite a lot.

854
01:19:36,625 --> 01:19:37,416
Really?

855
01:19:39,375 --> 01:19:41,500
No marriage is perfect.

856
01:19:42,625 --> 01:19:46,791
Each time we stop fighting...

857
01:19:47,708 --> 01:19:50,416
I can question again

858
01:19:51,125 --> 01:19:52,000
why...

859
01:19:53,375 --> 01:19:55,083
I married you.

860
01:19:56,166 --> 01:19:57,708
But I always remember

861
01:19:59,083 --> 01:20:01,833
how every time we stop fighting

862
01:20:02,375 --> 01:20:05,583
and we calm down,

863
01:20:08,458 --> 01:20:13,541
we will care

864
01:20:14,333 --> 01:20:16,000
about each other's feelings.

865
01:20:17,666 --> 01:20:23,000
Who's right or wrong,
we talk about it later.

866
01:20:24,250 --> 01:20:25,666
What's important is...

867
01:20:26,083 --> 01:20:28,250
we try to understand

868
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:32,166
our feelings.

869
01:20:33,416 --> 01:20:40,583
So, every time I regret
marrying you...

870
01:20:41,166 --> 01:20:46,250
at the end of the day, I always think...

871
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:48,875
it looks like

872
01:20:51,333 --> 01:20:53,375
even if I get to start over
hundreds of times...

873
01:20:54,625 --> 01:20:56,708
I will always choose you.

874
01:21:02,041 --> 01:21:03,708
You love me that much?

875
01:21:06,833 --> 01:21:09,250
You said it!

876
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,458
- Did I?
- Yes!

877
01:21:12,833 --> 01:21:13,958
I said that?

878
01:21:23,666 --> 01:21:24,500
Do you know

879
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:27,416
why dusk is so easy to love?

880
01:21:31,625 --> 01:21:34,041
Sometimes it's red, blushing happily...

881
01:21:35,708 --> 01:21:37,791
Sometimes it's black, dark and somber...

882
01:21:39,583 --> 01:21:41,000
But the sky...

883
01:21:42,125 --> 01:21:45,083
always accepts dusk as what it is.

884
01:21:47,166 --> 01:21:48,375
Did I say that, too?

885
01:21:50,958 --> 01:21:52,916
Can I even say such sweet words?

886
01:21:54,916 --> 01:21:56,333
You don't believe me?

887
01:21:57,333 --> 01:21:59,208
Why not?

888
01:21:59,708 --> 01:22:01,833
Really, those are your words.

889
01:22:02,125 --> 01:22:04,083
Oh gosh.

901
01:24:19,708 --> 01:24:20,666
Sore.

902
01:24:22,625 --> 01:24:23,541
Your nose...

903
01:24:30,458 --> 01:24:31,541
What's happening?

904
01:24:35,666 --> 01:24:36,625
Sore...

905
01:24:37,125 --> 01:24:38,583
Sore...

906
01:24:39,791 --> 01:24:40,625
Sore!

907
01:24:43,625 --> 01:24:45,333
What's wrong?

908
01:25:14,208 --> 01:25:16,583
Why is it restarting?
I haven't said anything.

909
01:25:26,375 --> 01:25:27,375
Who are you?

910
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,375
Whenever you're ready...

911
01:25:42,250 --> 01:25:43,541
I'm here.

912
01:25:44,458 --> 01:25:45,333
What's wrong?

913
01:25:47,833 --> 01:25:48,875
Nothing.

914
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:09,583
Even if I get to start over hundreds
of times, I'll always choose you.

915
01:26:16,750 --> 01:26:18,541
The night falls early.

916
01:26:19,583 --> 01:26:21,208
The sun is having

917
01:26:21,208 --> 01:26:22,958
an unusually busy week.

918
01:26:23,333 --> 01:26:24,666
These enhanced pictures from...

919
01:26:24,666 --> 01:26:26,666
NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory

920
01:26:26,666 --> 01:26:28,916
show exactly what's going on.

921
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:30,666
You can see here on the left,

922
01:26:30,666 --> 01:26:33,250
an explosion of radioactive material

923
01:26:33,250 --> 01:26:35,500
on a scale never seen before.

924
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:37,583
A gigantic solar flare.

925
01:26:38,166 --> 01:26:39,208
Over the last few days,

926
01:26:39,208 --> 01:26:40,166
there have been more than...

927
01:26:40,166 --> 01:26:42,666
half a dozen similar eruptions.

928
01:26:43,208 --> 01:26:44,333
And look at this image,

929
01:26:44,333 --> 01:26:46,500
super heated energy particles...

930
01:26:46,625 --> 01:26:46,958
Sore.

931
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:47,875
streaming towards the earth...

932
01:26:48,208 --> 01:26:50,500
at around 800 km per second.

933
01:26:50,916 --> 01:26:53,208
Now you may be able to see for yourself

934
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:55,625
when this solar wind hits earth.

935
01:26:55,958 --> 01:26:57,291
Beginning 10 May,

936
01:26:57,416 --> 01:27:00,083
Aurora will be visible in North America,

937
01:27:00,083 --> 01:27:03,833
Portugal, Spain, Croatia and some countries in Asia.

938
01:27:05,375 --> 01:27:06,250
He...

939
01:27:07,916 --> 01:27:09,083
He...

940
01:27:12,041 --> 01:27:13,416
He is mad.

941
01:27:13,875 --> 01:27:14,625
Who?

942
01:27:19,625 --> 01:27:23,000
Hey! Sore!

943
01:27:24,791 --> 01:27:36,958
TIME

944
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:51,000
Is it still far?

945
01:27:56,666 --> 01:27:57,916
Why are you rushing?

946
01:28:31,750 --> 01:28:33,750
Sore!

947
01:28:55,375 --> 01:28:58,791
Whenever you're ready...

948
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:02,125
I'm here.

949
01:29:04,583 --> 01:29:06,708
Even if I get to start over
hundreds of times,

950
01:29:07,875 --> 01:29:09,916
I'll always choose you.

951
01:29:10,875 --> 01:29:11,666
Sore!

952
01:29:17,583 --> 01:29:18,625
Sore!

953
01:29:20,625 --> 01:29:21,583
I'm Sore.

954
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,375
Your wife from the future.

955
01:29:30,958 --> 01:29:32,250
I can't, Jo.

956
01:29:34,083 --> 01:29:36,083
Sore!

957
01:29:39,083 --> 01:29:40,375
I can't...

958
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:49,875
Promise?

959
01:29:57,875 --> 01:29:59,666
Why is it night already?

960
01:30:07,708 --> 01:30:08,666
Jo.

961
01:30:11,291 --> 01:30:13,791
Don't let me fade away with time, okay?

962
01:30:16,583 --> 01:30:17,416
Huh?

963
01:30:24,041 --> 01:30:25,458
Don't forget me.

964
01:30:37,333 --> 01:30:38,125
Promise?

965
01:31:33,333 --> 01:31:34,250
Who are you?

966
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:49,333
Hi.

967
01:31:55,041 --> 01:31:56,208
I'm Sore.

968
01:31:59,416 --> 01:32:00,708
Your wife...

969
01:32:06,208 --> 01:32:07,750
forever.

970
01:33:45,416 --> 01:33:46,625
Hello.

971
01:33:51,708 --> 01:33:52,708
Jo...

972
01:33:52,750 --> 01:33:54,666
What did you do in the Arctic?

973
01:33:57,208 --> 01:33:58,250
Just the usual.

974
01:33:58,750 --> 01:34:00,250
You've changed.

975
01:34:01,333 --> 01:34:03,333
You're more calm.

976
01:34:03,791 --> 01:34:04,916
And...

977
01:34:07,250 --> 01:34:09,666
I don't know, I just feel that way.

978
01:34:11,708 --> 01:34:13,125
Okay.

979
01:34:13,375 --> 01:34:16,958
So, last night I spoke to Dad.

980
01:34:17,791 --> 01:34:20,208
And he agreed to help us out.

981
01:34:20,583 --> 01:34:22,625
He wants to open a restaurant for me.

982
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:25,916
And you can come along with me there.

983
01:34:27,625 --> 01:34:29,666
Whether this world deserves us.

984
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:32,166
Or we pretend...

985
01:34:33,208 --> 01:34:34,250
not to know,

986
01:34:34,708 --> 01:34:36,583
or never really think about it?

987
01:34:40,375 --> 01:34:41,375
Are you okay?

988
01:34:44,750 --> 01:34:45,791
Yeah.

989
01:34:48,083 --> 01:34:49,750
I just broke up with Elsa.

990
01:34:52,583 --> 01:34:53,583
Okay.

991
01:34:54,708 --> 01:34:56,083
I don't think it's going to work.

992
01:34:59,791 --> 01:35:02,083
I know that, but why now?

993
01:35:02,125 --> 01:35:03,166
What's happening?

994
01:35:25,333 --> 01:35:26,625
I don't know.

995
01:35:32,708 --> 01:35:34,125
I just feel...

996
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:40,125
How do I say it?

997
01:35:43,166 --> 01:35:44,000
Longing?

998
01:36:00,791 --> 01:36:03,333
I don't know who or what, but...

999
01:36:04,791 --> 01:36:06,250
When I woke up...

1000
01:36:09,625 --> 01:36:11,083
it felt like...

1001
01:36:12,625 --> 01:36:14,750
a tremendous feeling of longing.

1002
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:28,708
Longing's good.

1003
01:36:49,625 --> 01:36:50,541
Do you know

1004
01:36:51,333 --> 01:36:53,041
why dusk is so easy to love?

1005
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,416
Sometimes it's red, blushing happily...

1006
01:37:00,708 --> 01:37:03,041
Sometimes it's black, dark and somber...

1007
01:37:06,916 --> 01:37:08,166
But the sky...

1008
01:37:09,708 --> 01:37:12,250
always accepts dusk as what it is.

1009
01:38:16,583 --> 01:38:17,458
Yes?

1010
01:38:19,666 --> 01:38:21,250
Is this Seno's house?

1011
01:38:22,583 --> 01:38:23,583
Yes.

1012
01:38:31,833 --> 01:38:33,583
I'm from Indonesia, and...

1013
01:38:34,041 --> 01:38:35,375
Oh...

1014
01:38:37,458 --> 01:38:38,666
Do you want to come in?

1015
01:38:43,291 --> 01:38:44,291
Yes...

1016
01:38:55,541 --> 01:38:57,458
Wait here, I will call my husband.

1017
01:40:34,250 --> 01:40:36,291
Nothing can justify what you did.

1018
01:40:36,541 --> 01:40:38,708
But thank you for the best four years
you've given me.

1019
01:40:38,916 --> 01:40:40,625
- I forgive you.
- Jo

1020
01:40:51,083 --> 01:40:51,958
Honey?

1021
01:40:53,125 --> 01:40:54,083
Yes?

1022
01:40:54,625 --> 01:40:56,000
Are you okay?

1023
01:41:18,625 --> 01:41:20,541
So, you quit smoking and drinking

1024
01:41:20,541 --> 01:41:22,208
at the same time?

1025
01:41:23,958 --> 01:41:25,416
That's not healthy, man.

1026
01:41:32,291 --> 01:41:33,750
I'm going to miss this.

1027
01:41:38,916 --> 01:41:40,500
Come to Indonesia.

1028
01:42:52,208 --> 01:42:54,458
Since when do you exercise?

1029
01:42:57,166 --> 01:42:58,458
Starting slowly, Mom.

1030
01:43:18,166 --> 01:43:19,666
So, why did you come home?

1031
01:43:32,083 --> 01:43:33,083
I don't know.

1032
01:47:46,625 --> 01:47:48,000
This photo is weird, no?

1033
01:47:53,583 --> 01:47:54,583
Is it?

1034
01:47:57,291 --> 01:47:58,666
You feel that way, too?

1035
01:48:04,625 --> 01:48:06,750
The exhibition is about the Arctic.

1036
01:48:08,125 --> 01:48:10,791
Meaning, climate change.

1037
01:48:11,875 --> 01:48:13,583
Usually we want...

1038
01:48:15,416 --> 01:48:18,625
the atmosphere to stay cold,
like...

1039
01:48:19,166 --> 01:48:21,000
we don't want the ice to melt.

1040
01:48:23,750 --> 01:48:24,791
But this...

1041
01:48:25,125 --> 01:48:28,583
The image of the sunset
in the middle, it feels so...

1042
01:48:29,625 --> 01:48:30,625
How do I say it?

1043
01:48:35,083 --> 01:48:36,083
Warm?

1044
01:48:38,166 --> 01:48:41,166
I don't know, I have mixed feelings.

1045
01:48:46,208 --> 01:48:47,208
Or maybe...

1046
01:48:48,166 --> 01:48:50,166
this is just an act to look cool?

1047
01:48:55,416 --> 01:48:56,291
Excuse me.

1048
01:49:15,916 --> 01:49:22,000
I think climate change is not
just about melting ice in the Arctic.

1049
01:49:24,166 --> 01:49:27,958
It's not just life that we're going to lose.

1050
01:49:30,458 --> 01:49:31,833
But also beauty.

1051
01:49:36,916 --> 01:49:40,083
I don't think people will
change out of fear.

1052
01:49:45,083 --> 01:49:46,416
But because they feel loved.

1053
01:49:57,750 --> 01:49:59,875
This is what I felt...

1054
01:50:02,250 --> 01:50:03,791
when I saw the Aurora.

1055
01:50:06,875 --> 01:50:08,291
So, I want to share it.

1056
01:50:12,750 --> 01:50:15,250
Are you the photographer?

1057
01:50:17,291 --> 01:50:17,958
Oh my...

1058
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:20,375
I'm sorry.

1059
01:50:20,625 --> 01:50:22,541
- I didn't know.
- It's okay.

1060
01:50:22,666 --> 01:50:24,333
You can turn the lights back on.

1061
01:50:32,750 --> 01:50:34,666
I'm so sorry, once again...

1062
01:50:35,333 --> 01:50:36,750
I didn't mean...

1063
01:50:36,791 --> 01:50:39,291
Really, it's fine.
I'm grateful, actually.

1064
01:50:41,208 --> 01:50:42,625
I'm so happy

1065
01:50:43,041 --> 01:50:45,041
you observe my photos, one by one...

1066
01:50:47,416 --> 01:50:48,416
with such seriousness.

1067
01:50:58,875 --> 01:51:00,000
Jonathan.

1068
01:51:20,708 --> 01:51:21,875
Sore.

1069
01:52:04,166 --> 01:52:05,333
THE ARCTIC, 2023

1070
01:52:05,375 --> 01:52:08,416
THE ONLY PART OF THE EARTH
WITH NO TIME ZONE

1071
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:26,875
Who are you?

1072
01:53:27,708 --> 01:53:28,541
Hey!

1073
01:53:28,541 --> 01:53:30,541
I thought you were gone.

1074
01:53:30,750 --> 01:53:32,750
I was at your funeral.

1075
01:53:32,916 --> 01:53:34,916
I thought you were dead.

1076
01:53:40,166 --> 01:53:41,250
Hey!

1077
01:53:41,916 --> 01:53:42,916
Hey!

1078
01:53:44,583 --> 01:53:45,541
Hey!

1079
01:54:19,083 --> 01:54:20,458
Who are you?

1080
01:54:40,750 --> 01:54:41,416
Sore!

1081
01:54:48,208 --> 01:54:50,291
Sore!

1082
01:54:58,125 --> 01:55:00,208
Don't let me fade away with time.

1083
01:55:01,208 --> 01:55:02,500
Don't forget me.

3
00:02:31,634 --> 00:02:35,707
Sofia.
You didn't answer your phone.

4
00:02:38,054 --> 00:02:39,814
Sofia?

5
00:02:49,065 --> 00:02:51,101
Isn't she lovely?

6
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:54,277
Do you think
you'll ever marry, 'Fia?

7
00:02:55,968 --> 00:03:00,387
There is a reason
why the man is called the groom.

8
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,976
It's an ominous title.

9
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:14,263
Is that yours?

10
00:03:14,366 --> 00:03:17,887
Yes, you. Does that handbag
belong to you?

11
00:03:20,648 --> 00:03:22,754
Rose.

12
00:03:22,857 --> 00:03:26,620
He is unbearable,
even at a distance.

13
00:03:28,173 --> 00:03:32,004
The jellyfish
or the medusa, it has no bones,

14
00:03:32,108 --> 00:03:34,455
no brain, and no heart.

15
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:36,630
What it does have
is an ability...

16
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:40,289
They are so young,
Maggie and Tom.

17
00:03:40,392 --> 00:03:44,672
And the water is so loud.

18
00:03:44,776 --> 00:03:46,605
The mill.

19
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:49,781
And the town
condemns her.

20
00:03:49,884 --> 00:03:51,852
Fuckers.

21
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,512
Oh, again?

22
00:03:56,615 --> 00:03:58,376
I quite like
how primitive it is here.

23
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:01,310
It reminds me of
my mother's house.

24
00:04:01,413 --> 00:04:03,933
Will you fix it, 'Fia?

25
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:05,969
And would you get me
a spoon?

26
00:04:06,073 --> 00:04:07,385
Of course.

27
00:04:13,218 --> 00:04:15,220
That man should be shot,

28
00:04:15,324 --> 00:04:17,567
keeping his dog
chained on the roof.

29
00:04:17,671 --> 00:04:19,673
Blech.

30
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,891
Thanks.

31
00:04:30,994 --> 00:04:33,100
You're welcome.

32
00:04:33,203 --> 00:04:35,171
- Sleep well.
- You, too.

33
00:04:37,794 --> 00:04:40,590
Don't smoke near my dress.

34
00:04:51,705 --> 00:04:54,466
The grammar in this letter
is startling.

35
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:58,470
We have to be there
at 2:45 their time.

36
00:04:58,574 --> 00:05:01,197
Shall we order a taxi for half
past 1:00?

37
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,717
- It'll be very early.
- Mm.

38
00:05:04,994 --> 00:05:06,858
This cranial testing
he's talked about,

39
00:05:06,961 --> 00:05:09,170
I mean, nobody's
mentioned that before.

40
00:05:12,967 --> 00:05:16,281
It's going to be wonderful,
Sofia.

41
00:05:16,385 --> 00:05:18,525
I'm optimistic.

42
00:05:30,744 --> 00:05:35,783
I can't. I can't do it.
I just can't. I can't.

43
00:05:37,164 --> 00:05:41,444
I just can't tell my story
all over again, I just can't.

44
00:05:41,548 --> 00:05:45,068
It's...

45
00:05:45,172 --> 00:05:47,726
Perhaps we should just go home.

46
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,662
Come on, Rose.

47
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:56,217
You mortgaged
our house for this.

48
00:05:56,321 --> 00:06:00,946
My house.
What if it doesn't work?

49
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:05,192
This dress is wrong.
Can we change it, 'Fia?

50
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,455
Hola.

51
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:03,837
W-We're from London.

52
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,115
No problem.

53
00:07:21,924 --> 00:07:24,961
So, sometimes
you do feel your legs.

54
00:07:25,065 --> 00:07:29,518
Yeah, I-I can walk.
Um, perhaps once a year.

55
00:07:29,621 --> 00:07:35,524
I have no idea why I can
when I do, it just happens.

56
00:07:35,627 --> 00:07:38,147
You were a librarian.
What were your duties?

57
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:42,600
I do the cataloging.
I indexed and classified books.

58
00:07:42,703 --> 00:07:45,188
- Hmm. And you were born?
- I'm 64.

59
00:07:45,292 --> 00:07:47,881
- In Ireland?
- Yes, in a small town.

60
00:07:47,984 --> 00:07:51,332
- The population was...
- No one. No one.

61
00:07:51,436 --> 00:07:54,163
And you moved to London when?

62
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,924
I left home,
and I went to university there.

63
00:07:57,028 --> 00:07:59,582
I was the first person
in my family to do that.

64
00:07:59,686 --> 00:08:01,515
And your parents
were proud?

65
00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:03,483
My father was, yeah.

66
00:08:05,623 --> 00:08:09,350
Sofia.
You live with your mother?

67
00:08:09,454 --> 00:08:11,111
Yes.

68
00:08:11,214 --> 00:08:13,838
And what do you think
about your mother's condition?

69
00:08:13,941 --> 00:08:16,185
Rose hasn't been able to walk
since I was four.

70
00:08:21,846 --> 00:08:23,779
Julieta, estarás a cargo

71
00:08:23,882 --> 00:08:28,335
de las terapias físicas,
por favor.

72
00:08:28,438 --> 00:08:30,751
And is anyone else
in the family?

73
00:08:30,855 --> 00:08:33,513
No. There's no one else.
Just me and Sofia.

74
00:08:33,616 --> 00:08:36,688
I waited a long time
for my only.

75
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:39,622
Hmm. And you work?

76
00:08:39,726 --> 00:08:41,451
In a coffee bar.

77
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:43,177
I deferred my studies.

78
00:08:43,281 --> 00:08:46,526
Sofia is a permanent student
of anthropology.

79
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:49,563
Wonderful.
You study patterns.

80
00:08:53,705 --> 00:08:55,293
Doctor Gomez.

81
00:08:55,396 --> 00:08:57,329
Just Gomez, please.

82
00:08:57,433 --> 00:09:00,436
Where do you feel pain now?

83
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,922
Um, in my leg.
Uh, in my right elbow.

84
00:09:04,026 --> 00:09:06,511
And I have chronic
knuckle pain here.

85
00:09:06,615 --> 00:09:07,961
And you feel nothing
below your knees?

86
00:09:08,064 --> 00:09:11,654
That's right.
I'm a rare case.

87
00:09:11,758 --> 00:09:14,933
Sofia, you may go
and come back in two hours.

88
00:09:16,763 --> 00:09:22,527
Um, you feel nothing here?

89
00:09:22,631 --> 00:09:24,529
Nothing?

90
00:10:08,884 --> 00:10:11,024
- Sofia...
- Yeah? Thanks.

91
00:10:11,127 --> 00:10:13,026
Gomez has taken me
off three of my pills.

92
00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:15,062
- Really?
- You know, other doctors,

93
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,755
they talked about
iron deficiency and diabetes.

94
00:10:17,858 --> 00:10:19,653
Well, it's far more
complex than that,

95
00:10:19,757 --> 00:10:21,034
but we have begun.

96
00:10:21,137 --> 00:10:23,968
- Oh, good.
- Nurse Sunshine is my daughter,

97
00:10:24,071 --> 00:10:27,074
and today it's her birthday.

98
00:10:27,178 --> 00:10:28,904
- Et j'ai rempli les papiers.
- Et c'est signé?

99
00:10:29,007 --> 00:10:30,526
- Oui, Papa.
- Très bien.

100
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,148
- Do you need some help?
- No, we're fine.

101
00:10:32,252 --> 00:10:33,771
- We're fine, thanks. Thanks.
- Thanks.

102
00:10:33,874 --> 00:10:35,462
- I'll see you tomorrow?
- Yeah.

103
00:10:35,565 --> 00:10:38,120
Happy birthday.

104
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:54,446
These are to be chucked.

105
00:10:56,966 --> 00:10:58,554
Don't you want to wait?

106
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,384
For what?

107
00:11:01,488 --> 00:11:07,459
Someone is making money
out of my prescription.

108
00:11:07,563 --> 00:11:09,082
I mean, you've watched me.

109
00:11:12,188 --> 00:11:17,228
All those pills.
You are my witness.

110
00:11:20,231 --> 00:11:23,130
They fed me like an ardent child
in a sweetshop.

111
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:30,241
He cares. I can tell.

112
00:11:30,344 --> 00:11:32,415
You paid him 25 grand.

113
00:11:34,003 --> 00:11:37,179
Hmm. Euros.
Which is less.

114
00:11:40,976 --> 00:11:44,911
Have faith, 'Fia, would you?

115
00:11:45,014 --> 00:11:47,223
Isn't it dangerous
to just stop?

116
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,096
Why don't you go out
and just do some work?

117
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:03,205
I will.

118
00:12:08,175 --> 00:12:10,971
And just...

119
00:12:11,075 --> 00:12:14,803
I need a different water.

120
00:12:14,906 --> 00:12:17,529
Would you get me another type?

121
00:12:24,467 --> 00:12:26,331
Hola, guapa.

122
00:13:25,874 --> 00:13:28,600
I'd rather be dead,
wouldn't you?

123
00:13:28,704 --> 00:13:30,464
Than shackled.

124
00:13:32,294 --> 00:13:34,365
You should rent
a different place.

125
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,369
I like it here.

126
00:13:41,751 --> 00:13:43,823
I went walking once...

127
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:47,585
...when I was your age.

128
00:13:47,688 --> 00:13:50,519
By the sea.

129
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:54,040
And then up this cliff.

130
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:00,391
And the people on the beach,

131
00:14:00,494 --> 00:14:03,394
they stared
as I started up this incline.

132
00:14:05,741 --> 00:14:08,054
The grass is so lush

133
00:14:08,157 --> 00:14:12,127
and the rain was so soft
on my hair.

134
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,272
And I kept looking over
the edge.

135
00:14:21,481 --> 00:14:24,622
And wondering how I would look
if I fell onto the rocks.

136
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,973
How my death would look.

137
00:14:33,562 --> 00:14:35,771
I was happy.

138
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,669
I had no bag.

139
00:14:37,773 --> 00:14:41,432
Just a cheese roll
and some tobacco.

140
00:14:47,369 --> 00:14:51,131
I stood at the top there
and I...

141
00:14:51,235 --> 00:14:54,065
just had a cigarette.

142
00:14:54,169 --> 00:14:57,551
You should go back there.

143
00:14:57,655 --> 00:15:00,106
Find it.

144
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:02,384
Hmm?

145
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,629
I can't walk.

146
00:15:13,153 --> 00:15:16,432
What would you do
if I could walk?

147
00:15:16,536 --> 00:15:18,918
I'd be happy.

148
00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:28,203
Gomez is the last one.

149
00:15:30,101 --> 00:15:32,000
Er, laces.

150
00:15:43,563 --> 00:15:45,910
A subject that we
kept returning to

151
00:15:46,014 --> 00:15:47,912
was the Balinese trance dance,

152
00:15:48,016 --> 00:15:50,570
where young women fight
against a witch.

153
00:17:17,243 --> 00:17:19,107
What's your full name?

154
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:21,178
Sofia Papastergiadis.

155
00:17:21,281 --> 00:17:23,697
You have to stay
here five minutes in case

156
00:17:23,801 --> 00:17:26,114
you have a reaction.

157
00:17:26,217 --> 00:17:29,082
Age and occupation here.

158
00:17:31,498 --> 00:17:34,053
Do many people
ride horses here?

159
00:17:34,156 --> 00:17:36,055
Try not to touch the wound.

160
00:17:38,505 --> 00:17:39,748
Oh, sorry.

161
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:43,062
I'm done.

162
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,447
Hi.

163
00:17:49,551 --> 00:17:51,518
The water's still wrong, 'Fia.

164
00:17:55,626 --> 00:17:58,905
This book, I realized,
is not about love.

165
00:17:59,008 --> 00:18:01,149
It is about shame.

166
00:18:05,153 --> 00:18:07,810
What's happened to your arm?

167
00:18:07,914 --> 00:18:09,295
Jellyfish.

168
00:18:09,398 --> 00:18:10,882
Well, you'll have
to get that seen to.

169
00:18:10,986 --> 00:18:12,229
I already did.

170
00:18:12,332 --> 00:18:14,093
Well, come here,
let me have a look.

171
00:18:14,196 --> 00:18:18,718
God. Put water on that
and blow on it.

172
00:18:21,065 --> 00:18:23,757
Well, you know,
at least you can swim.

173
00:18:23,861 --> 00:18:25,656
Pain won't last long.

174
00:18:28,176 --> 00:18:29,625
Can we go out now?

175
00:18:32,421 --> 00:18:34,458
Yeah.

176
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,470
Watches.
I want one.

177
00:18:46,573 --> 00:18:47,781
Why?

178
00:18:47,885 --> 00:18:49,783
My father always wore one.

179
00:18:51,751 --> 00:18:54,650
Did Christos have one?

180
00:18:54,754 --> 00:18:58,447
Sort of digital horror he had.
With lights.

181
00:18:58,551 --> 00:19:00,622
And then he had
such nice hair.

182
00:19:00,725 --> 00:19:04,798
I sort of fell in love
with the way his hair fell.

183
00:19:04,902 --> 00:19:07,076
You have different hair.

184
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,527
What are these watches then?

185
00:19:11,564 --> 00:19:13,704
Wh-What have you got there?

186
00:19:15,568 --> 00:19:17,432
Oh, yeah, that's...
No, no, no.

187
00:19:17,535 --> 00:19:19,330
They are very simple.
They're three--

188
00:19:19,434 --> 00:19:21,056
They're three personnages.

189
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,371
Uh, the father, the mother,
and the child. Right.

190
00:19:25,474 --> 00:19:27,614
Which is the father?

191
00:19:27,718 --> 00:19:30,134
I don't care.
But I am the child.

192
00:19:30,238 --> 00:19:31,722
Okay. You are the child?

193
00:19:31,825 --> 00:19:34,345
I am the child.

194
00:19:36,727 --> 00:19:38,556
Gracias.

195
00:20:21,392 --> 00:20:24,602
Do you smoke?

196
00:20:24,706 --> 00:20:26,466
Yeah.

197
00:20:29,883 --> 00:20:32,541
Do you have cigarettes?

198
00:20:32,645 --> 00:20:34,681
Yeah.

199
00:20:36,856 --> 00:20:38,651
Okay. Let's go.

200
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,965
Ingrid.

201
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,303
What do you do
in London?

202
00:21:12,409 --> 00:21:14,342
I'm writing about
Margaret Mead at the moment.

203
00:21:14,445 --> 00:21:17,759
Who's that? She sounds dead.

204
00:21:20,417 --> 00:21:22,384
S-She was an anthropologist.

205
00:21:22,488 --> 00:21:23,972
She went to
the South Sea Islands

206
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:26,285
and wrote about teenagers
to try and figure out

207
00:21:26,388 --> 00:21:28,252
if adolescence is always
a terrible time,

208
00:21:28,356 --> 00:21:30,496
or if it's just
a Western thing.

209
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:32,946
It's about nature
versus nurture.

210
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,754
It's shoes!

211
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:04,599
Tell me about your woman.

212
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,638
Okay.

213
00:22:09,742 --> 00:22:13,539
She writes
that life is flexible,

214
00:22:13,642 --> 00:22:17,577
as in, we can change it,
but that it's also elastic.

215
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:20,718
Because we always go back
to what we grew up with.

216
00:22:20,822 --> 00:22:22,651
Essentially.

217
00:22:25,067 --> 00:22:26,862
Fuck that shit.

218
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:38,598
Look at all this blue, Sofie.

219
00:22:45,398 --> 00:22:48,090
- Cyan.
- It's blue.

220
00:22:48,194 --> 00:22:50,955
It's blue.

221
00:23:04,072 --> 00:23:05,591
And?

222
00:23:15,014 --> 00:23:17,499
Matty?

223
00:23:17,603 --> 00:23:20,122
Matty, can you hear the sea?

224
00:23:22,642 --> 00:23:25,611
I'm always late.

225
00:23:25,714 --> 00:23:29,166
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah. Mm.

226
00:23:55,123 --> 00:23:57,021
You're not using
our rental car?

227
00:23:57,125 --> 00:24:00,300
Sofia doesn't drive.
She failed her test four times.

228
00:24:00,404 --> 00:24:03,200
Well, perhaps
your imagination is too active.

229
00:24:03,303 --> 00:24:05,651
Did you imagine that you would
finally kill people?

230
00:24:05,754 --> 00:24:07,307
She failed her theory, too,

231
00:24:07,411 --> 00:24:11,346
where no one was
in any palpable danger.

232
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:15,143
Rose,
we have the scan of your feet.

233
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:19,458
Uh... Sofia.

234
00:24:19,561 --> 00:24:23,392
Could you tell me
about your father?

235
00:24:23,496 --> 00:24:25,636
He left when I was four,

236
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,845
and I've seen him a few times
since then.

237
00:24:27,949 --> 00:24:29,122
The last time?

238
00:24:29,226 --> 00:24:30,848
When I was 15.

239
00:24:30,952 --> 00:24:35,543
Two years ago, he inherited
his father's shipping business.

240
00:24:35,646 --> 00:24:38,615
He gave Sofia nothing.

241
00:24:38,718 --> 00:24:42,273
And you, Rose.
You have sisters? Brothers?

242
00:24:42,377 --> 00:24:44,206
Three brothers, older.

243
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,001
I had a sister, but she died.

244
00:24:46,105 --> 00:24:47,900
It was a-- a tragedy?

245
00:24:48,003 --> 00:24:51,490
No, they never
talked about her.

246
00:24:51,593 --> 00:24:56,080
Well, it's imperative
to talk about the dead.

247
00:24:56,184 --> 00:24:57,944
What was your sister's name?

248
00:24:58,048 --> 00:25:01,292
Mary. Oh, I didn't know her.
She died before I was born.

249
00:25:05,814 --> 00:25:09,404
I would like you to think about
your enemies, Rose.

250
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,751
Make a list.

251
00:25:11,855 --> 00:25:13,684
We don't have access
to a printer.

252
00:25:13,788 --> 00:25:17,446
Handwritten is best,
Mrs. Papastergiadis.

253
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:36,180
I was waiting for
a long time.

254
00:26:36,284 --> 00:26:38,597
- Sorry.
- You didn't hear me.

255
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,633
I had my music on.

256
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,776
Should be listening
out for me instead.

257
00:29:06,365 --> 00:29:08,781
Do you want
to go inside?

258
00:29:10,956 --> 00:29:13,096
I want to go, but we can't.

259
00:29:18,929 --> 00:29:22,312
How long does it take to ladle
out a bowl of bean soup?

260
00:29:22,415 --> 00:29:24,107
Sofia's only having salad.

261
00:29:26,626 --> 00:29:28,905
People think that all
those little white cottages

262
00:29:29,008 --> 00:29:30,872
out in the middle of nowhere
are romantic.

263
00:29:30,976 --> 00:29:32,771
- They're not.
- Why not?

264
00:29:32,874 --> 00:29:36,119
Well, everyone's watching you.

265
00:29:39,743 --> 00:29:42,021
I think I'll have a glass
of white wine.

266
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:44,783
No. No alcohol. We're working.

267
00:29:44,886 --> 00:29:48,269
Ah, beautiful. There you go.

268
00:29:48,372 --> 00:29:49,788
Nice.

269
00:29:49,891 --> 00:29:52,169
That-- That will make
me come out in hives.

270
00:29:52,273 --> 00:29:54,309
- Hmm?
- I'm allergic to fish.

271
00:29:54,413 --> 00:29:55,828
I-I told you that.

272
00:29:55,932 --> 00:29:58,244
Well, if you have a reaction,
I'll move.

273
00:30:03,871 --> 00:30:06,183
Hey.

274
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:12,465
Gomez.

275
00:30:16,573 --> 00:30:18,092
Rose?

276
00:30:20,715 --> 00:30:22,786
My eye hurts now.

277
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:25,030
Did you write your list?

278
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:31,415
Could we sit away
from this table?

279
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,938
Tell me who's on the list,
Rose.

280
00:30:37,042 --> 00:30:40,183
Well, he's on it, obviously.

281
00:30:40,286 --> 00:30:43,980
And, um, my parents,
they weren't helpful.

282
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:47,984
And, so, I married a Greek,
and I escaped.

283
00:30:48,087 --> 00:30:50,469
When did you last see
your mother and father?

284
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:56,682
Uh, they both died, actually,
in hospital. Separately.

285
00:30:56,785 --> 00:30:58,477
But I-I wasn't there.

286
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,375
Did you want to be there?

287
00:31:03,585 --> 00:31:05,242
No. Mnh-mnh.

288
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,456
And who is "he"?

289
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,941
Christos.

290
00:31:14,044 --> 00:31:15,735
Sofia's father?

291
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:17,461
When Sofia was four,

292
00:31:17,565 --> 00:31:24,296
Christos found God,
and he left for Athens.

293
00:31:26,712 --> 00:31:28,369
How's your eye?

294
00:31:32,304 --> 00:31:33,374
Hola.

295
00:31:33,477 --> 00:31:36,101
Do you have the keys
to the hire car?

296
00:31:36,204 --> 00:31:38,379
Thank you, Julieta.

297
00:31:47,422 --> 00:31:50,529
- Sofie.
- Hi.

298
00:31:52,082 --> 00:31:53,463
This is Matty.

299
00:31:53,566 --> 00:31:55,706
He's going to drive
your car for you.

300
00:32:00,056 --> 00:32:03,335
- Hi.
- Hi.

301
00:32:03,438 --> 00:32:05,647
Cigarette?

302
00:32:21,525 --> 00:32:24,080
- Il tu promenade.
- Thank you.

303
00:32:24,183 --> 00:32:26,634
That's great.
Thank you.

304
00:32:33,227 --> 00:32:35,608
Do you know we're near
the desert here?

305
00:32:35,712 --> 00:32:38,335
Really?

306
00:32:39,612 --> 00:32:41,683
Yes.
They made films here.

307
00:32:41,787 --> 00:32:44,790
I could take you.

308
00:32:44,893 --> 00:32:47,551
Do you drive full-time?

309
00:32:47,655 --> 00:32:49,450
No, I'm a musician.

310
00:32:53,454 --> 00:32:56,146
- You okay?
- Oh. I'm grand. Thanks, Matty.

311
00:32:59,184 --> 00:33:02,290
But you can't live
by your music.

312
00:33:02,394 --> 00:33:05,155
I do this, I do that.

313
00:33:09,711 --> 00:33:11,368
Good for you, Matty.

314
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:14,535
How do you sleep?

315
00:34:14,638 --> 00:34:16,088
Not well.

316
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:18,677
You move in your sleep?
Your legs move?

317
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,506
Yes, they do. How--

318
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:23,716
- You can tell that?
- Mm-hmm. The muscle.

319
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,511
Do you dream at night?

320
00:34:25,615 --> 00:34:30,137
Always. Vivid dreams.
It's always night.

321
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,864
I've lost my bag
or I can't find the bus stop.

322
00:34:33,968 --> 00:34:35,935
Do you dream?

323
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:37,558
I dream of the desert often.

324
00:34:37,661 --> 00:34:41,976
- Hmm.
- And being underwater.

325
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,805
You need weight-bearing
exercises

326
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:47,154
for strengthening and endurance.

327
00:34:47,257 --> 00:34:50,502
My whole life has been
endurance.

328
00:34:50,605 --> 00:34:55,576
Oh, my first enemy
and adversary is endurance.

329
00:34:59,614 --> 00:35:02,100
Everything hurts.

330
00:35:02,203 --> 00:35:07,243
Lo se. Lo se.
But you are strong.

331
00:35:30,231 --> 00:35:33,338
'Fia?
I'm ready for bed.

332
00:35:33,441 --> 00:35:35,719
Will you lock us in?

333
00:36:35,814 --> 00:36:41,751
Julieta gave me these
yoga poses.

334
00:36:41,854 --> 00:36:44,132
I remember this book was
in the library.

335
00:36:44,236 --> 00:36:45,893
It was from the '70s.

336
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:48,585
Look, it's the lion's pose.

337
00:36:48,689 --> 00:36:50,553
Oh.

338
00:36:52,382 --> 00:36:54,004
- Very good one.
- Jesus.

339
00:36:56,628 --> 00:36:57,836
Hmm.

340
00:36:57,939 --> 00:37:01,046
Do you think you'll
ever finish your studies?

341
00:37:01,149 --> 00:37:03,497
Yeah, of course I will.

342
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,776
Yeah. It's just you find
it difficult to finish things.

343
00:37:35,011 --> 00:37:39,291
It's my favorite fabric
'cause it's alive like a bird.

344
00:37:43,951 --> 00:37:45,470
"Beloved."

345
00:37:45,573 --> 00:37:49,128
I thought of my little
sister when I worked on it.

346
00:37:49,232 --> 00:37:52,166
Hannah.

347
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,375
Hannah?

348
00:37:55,997 --> 00:37:58,724
She's...

349
00:37:58,828 --> 00:38:01,796
...in Dusseldorf.

350
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,765
She's younger than me.

351
00:38:04,868 --> 00:38:06,387
Much younger.

352
00:38:16,328 --> 00:38:19,883
I couldn't really wake up today.

353
00:38:19,987 --> 00:38:21,575
I had a...

354
00:38:24,198 --> 00:38:25,993
I had a bad day.

355
00:38:36,037 --> 00:38:37,763
Hi.

356
00:39:05,515 --> 00:39:07,137
Mm.

357
00:39:08,967 --> 00:39:11,210
It's so weird.

358
00:39:11,314 --> 00:39:13,143
The branches are screwed on.

359
00:39:13,247 --> 00:39:16,215
Look, here and here.

360
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:18,148
Yeah.

361
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:23,430
- Maybe for a film?
- Yeah.

362
00:39:24,914 --> 00:39:28,400
I'm just quite sad
it's not real.

363
00:39:28,504 --> 00:39:30,506
It's real.

364
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,856
I love the desert.

365
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:38,514
When I was a child, I wanted
to live in the desert.

366
00:39:38,617 --> 00:39:41,482
- You did?
- In the Sahara with a camel.

367
00:39:41,586 --> 00:39:44,278
Really? Why? Why the Sahara?

368
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:47,971
The name-- Sahara.

369
00:39:49,697 --> 00:39:51,561
Were you happy as a kid?

370
00:39:53,701 --> 00:39:55,462
Are you happy now?

371
00:40:01,295 --> 00:40:05,472
What did you
want when you were growing up?

372
00:40:11,995 --> 00:40:13,790
A crazy bicycle,

373
00:40:13,894 --> 00:40:16,828
red shoes,

374
00:40:16,931 --> 00:40:20,038
a cat.

375
00:40:20,141 --> 00:40:21,764
Any friends?

376
00:40:26,631 --> 00:40:30,048
I like to stay to myself.

377
00:40:30,151 --> 00:40:32,153
Why?

378
00:40:32,257 --> 00:40:34,224
Why not?

379
00:40:37,055 --> 00:40:39,229
Must have been a reason.

380
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:41,300
Stop doing that.

381
00:40:41,404 --> 00:40:44,407
Stop what?

382
00:40:44,511 --> 00:40:48,066
Pinning me down like one
of your butterflies.

383
00:40:49,101 --> 00:40:51,863
- Needling to the wall.
- I don't do that.

384
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:59,767
Like your woman who studied
the teenagers on the islands.

385
00:40:59,871 --> 00:41:02,390
She should have left
the teenagers alone

386
00:41:02,494 --> 00:41:04,979
and studied herself instead.

387
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:06,705
It's questioning.

388
00:41:06,809 --> 00:41:09,708
It's cultural memory.
Its important.

389
00:41:09,812 --> 00:41:12,987
It can help people,

390
00:41:13,091 --> 00:41:14,195
could stop wars.

391
00:41:14,299 --> 00:41:17,198
Well, it hasn't stopped
anything so far, has it?

392
00:41:20,961 --> 00:41:23,066
Do you want to know
what I was like as a kid?

393
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:24,482
No.

394
00:41:26,207 --> 00:41:28,762
You're still a kid.

395
00:41:28,865 --> 00:41:30,591
Okay.

396
00:41:50,646 --> 00:41:52,544
I killed someone.

397
00:42:15,084 --> 00:42:17,051
Sofie.

398
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:23,299
It was a long time ago.

399
00:42:48,082 --> 00:42:49,705
Ingrid.

400
00:43:13,901 --> 00:43:15,178
It's beautiful.

401
00:43:15,282 --> 00:43:18,354
A child has more bones
than an adult.

402
00:43:18,457 --> 00:43:20,183
As we get older, they fuse.

403
00:43:20,287 --> 00:43:22,841
But my spine has certainly
changed a lot, hasn't it, Sofia,

404
00:43:22,945 --> 00:43:24,912
since the last set of X-rays?

405
00:43:26,983 --> 00:43:29,330
How much time do you think
we'll need?

406
00:43:31,505 --> 00:43:33,058
We'll see.

407
00:44:58,834 --> 00:45:00,387
How have you been?

408
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:03,355
I left you messages.

409
00:45:03,459 --> 00:45:06,220
I know. I received them.

410
00:45:09,327 --> 00:45:13,849
Look. I'm making this
for an old man I met.

411
00:45:15,091 --> 00:45:18,129
He asked me to personalize it.

412
00:45:18,232 --> 00:45:20,200
What color do you
think I should use

413
00:45:20,303 --> 00:45:23,030
to border it with?

414
00:45:23,134 --> 00:45:24,791
Yellow?

415
00:45:28,415 --> 00:45:29,519
Yeah.

416
00:45:31,452 --> 00:45:32,971
Yeah.

417
00:45:35,802 --> 00:45:37,527
I want to take a picture
of you.

418
00:45:42,636 --> 00:45:44,327
So I remember.

419
00:45:50,851 --> 00:45:52,853
Sofie.

420
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:03,830
August in Almeria.

421
00:46:05,348 --> 00:46:07,143
Memory's a bomb.

422
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,390
Mm.

423
00:46:27,715 --> 00:46:29,925
I have to get back to work now.

424
00:46:35,033 --> 00:46:38,554
Can I stay
and read for a bit maybe?

425
00:46:38,657 --> 00:46:40,901
Matty just went to get
some food.

426
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,458
Okay.

427
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:13,934
Sofia?

428
00:47:16,005 --> 00:47:18,180
Sofia, come and sit with me.

429
00:47:59,773 --> 00:48:04,951
♪ No troubles, no troubles

430
00:48:05,054 --> 00:48:08,299
♪ And I pressed...

431
00:48:35,947 --> 00:48:37,535
What?

432
00:48:40,227 --> 00:48:42,091
I like your work.

433
00:49:06,874 --> 00:49:09,291
What happened
to your mother?

434
00:49:11,017 --> 00:49:13,571
Nothing.

435
00:49:13,674 --> 00:49:15,745
She was a librarian.

436
00:49:18,162 --> 00:49:21,165
I like your mother very much.

437
00:49:21,268 --> 00:49:24,099
But something happened to her.

438
00:49:24,202 --> 00:49:26,929
You can feel it in her body.

439
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:59,272
Julieta Gomez is
an alcoholic.

440
00:49:59,375 --> 00:50:03,034
I smelt it on her breath
the first time.

441
00:50:04,139 --> 00:50:05,657
I was her birthday.

442
00:50:05,761 --> 00:50:07,452
And since then.

443
00:50:10,524 --> 00:50:12,216
I thought a change
would be good for you.

444
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:14,804
Can you stop, please?

445
00:50:14,908 --> 00:50:17,048
As a child,
you hated change.

446
00:50:19,326 --> 00:50:22,674
You were always fearful.

447
00:50:22,778 --> 00:50:24,469
You were never brave.

448
00:50:26,506 --> 00:50:28,025
Where are you in your cycle?

449
00:50:28,128 --> 00:50:31,580
Shush! No!

450
00:50:51,117 --> 00:50:53,567
Sofia?

451
00:50:53,671 --> 00:50:55,707
I need water.

452
00:50:58,538 --> 00:51:00,505
Sofia.

453
00:51:00,609 --> 00:51:03,163
Why are you cooking?
Did you invite someone over?

454
00:51:12,586 --> 00:51:14,554
- Untie the dog, Pablo.
- Excuse me?

455
00:51:14,657 --> 00:51:16,418
- Please untie the dog.
- Does your mother--

456
00:51:16,521 --> 00:51:18,144
Untie the fucking dog now!

457
00:51:18,247 --> 00:51:19,904
Do it now! Go!

458
00:51:20,007 --> 00:51:23,701
You fucking heard me!
Untie it now!

459
00:51:23,804 --> 00:51:27,429
Puta!
Fuck you!

460
00:52:48,441 --> 00:52:51,168
You're a monster.

461
00:52:57,070 --> 00:52:58,623
Stay with me.

462
00:53:05,389 --> 00:53:07,494
I'm going back to Berlin.

463
00:53:09,669 --> 00:53:12,603
You should come spend
Christmas with me.

464
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:17,504
I'll get you a ticket.

465
00:53:17,608 --> 00:53:19,265
And you walk
from the Brandenburger Tor

466
00:53:19,368 --> 00:53:21,474
to Checkpoint Charlie.

467
00:53:21,577 --> 00:53:23,579
And you have to bring
a heavy coat.

468
00:53:23,683 --> 00:53:25,202
In the snow.

469
00:53:25,305 --> 00:53:27,652
And I will hold up
a mistletoe over your head.

470
00:53:27,756 --> 00:53:29,965
You will have to perform
the ritual.

471
00:53:45,256 --> 00:53:47,085
Your brothers told you?

472
00:53:47,189 --> 00:53:50,365
No.
But when they visited,

473
00:53:50,468 --> 00:53:52,608
their behavior towards me.

474
00:53:54,886 --> 00:53:56,371
You knew?

475
00:53:58,821 --> 00:54:01,859
I felt it.

476
00:54:01,962 --> 00:54:05,587
Like a confirmation.

477
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:08,175
From the people
you asked?

478
00:54:08,279 --> 00:54:10,557
And did you tell them at home?

479
00:54:10,661 --> 00:54:14,734
I couldn't.
It was a...

480
00:54:14,837 --> 00:54:17,737
a very cold house.

481
00:54:20,222 --> 00:54:23,605
They would have been appalled

482
00:54:23,708 --> 00:54:26,849
that I had written to people.

483
00:54:28,817 --> 00:54:32,510
They just--
They couldn't communicate.

484
00:54:32,614 --> 00:54:35,030
But perhaps they tried.

485
00:54:35,133 --> 00:54:36,756
No.

486
00:54:38,827 --> 00:54:41,208
No, they didn't.

487
00:54:41,312 --> 00:54:43,176
They couldn't.

488
00:55:01,125 --> 00:55:02,885
You're doing really well.
You're doing so well.

489
00:55:02,989 --> 00:55:05,440
- I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, no, no. It's good.

490
00:55:05,543 --> 00:55:07,165
- I'm sorry.
- It's good.

491
00:55:07,269 --> 00:55:08,546
Oh, God.

492
00:55:08,650 --> 00:55:10,962
- It's very good.
- Oh. Oh.

493
00:55:41,372 --> 00:55:43,512
Are you here?

494
00:55:46,066 --> 00:55:48,517
Yes.

495
00:55:48,621 --> 00:55:52,383
Are you really here?

496
00:55:52,487 --> 00:55:54,834
Yes, I am.

497
00:55:54,937 --> 00:55:57,077
I'm here.

498
00:56:02,911 --> 00:56:04,844
I'm glad.

499
00:56:28,419 --> 00:56:30,007
Ingrid.

500
00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:31,353
Hmm?

501
00:56:31,457 --> 00:56:33,700
Who did you kill?

502
00:56:37,463 --> 00:56:38,912
Tell me.

503
00:56:58,173 --> 00:57:00,002
Sofie.

504
00:57:14,154 --> 00:57:15,639
My sister.

505
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:20,437
When I was six.

506
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:22,784
She was...

507
00:57:25,062 --> 00:57:27,133
...on a swing.

508
00:57:27,236 --> 00:57:33,001
And I was pushing her and, um...

509
00:57:33,104 --> 00:57:37,488
And then, she fell and...

510
00:57:37,592 --> 00:57:41,147
her skull cracked.

511
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:43,149
But she didn't die.

512
00:57:43,252 --> 00:57:46,221
She just stopped.

513
00:57:50,328 --> 00:57:52,399
I'm sorry.

514
00:57:52,503 --> 00:57:57,163
No, don't say that. It's--

515
00:57:57,266 --> 00:58:00,131
It doesn't matter.

516
00:58:08,588 --> 00:58:10,556
Where is she now?

517
00:58:12,523 --> 00:58:15,284
Somewhere in a home.

518
00:58:15,388 --> 00:58:17,839
With strangers.

519
00:58:19,806 --> 00:58:23,120
She's my age, but she's...

520
00:58:25,053 --> 00:58:27,780
Her mind is five.

521
00:58:31,197 --> 00:58:35,995
And I remember just wanting her
to go higher, you know?

522
00:58:36,098 --> 00:58:38,135
I wanted her to fly.

523
00:58:43,416 --> 00:58:45,832
You were just a kid.

524
00:58:49,456 --> 00:58:51,976
- It's innocent.
- No.

525
00:58:53,806 --> 00:58:57,326
No, Sofie,
you don't understand.

526
00:58:57,430 --> 00:58:59,881
I was never innocent.

527
00:59:12,272 --> 00:59:14,723
But you do love me?

528
00:59:16,725 --> 00:59:19,176
Of course I love you.

529
00:59:25,009 --> 00:59:28,461
You have to ask
yourself who you are, Rose.

530
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:32,154
I'm someone
with a bone condition.

531
00:59:32,258 --> 00:59:35,088
- I know that.
- And I can't walk.

532
00:59:47,825 --> 00:59:50,138
- What you told me...
- I'm losing bone density.

533
00:59:50,241 --> 00:59:52,105
...who you truly are,

534
00:59:52,209 --> 00:59:55,039
it's far more relevant
than a question of bone density.

535
00:59:55,143 --> 00:59:58,353
You realize that?

536
00:59:58,456 --> 01:00:01,459
You wanted events.
I gave you some.

537
01:00:01,563 --> 01:00:04,359
Could I have some water, please?

538
01:00:12,436 --> 01:00:14,162
Thank you.

539
01:00:15,991 --> 01:00:17,648
Do you want me to stop
all my pills?

540
01:00:17,752 --> 01:00:19,512
Is that what you
were saying the last time?

541
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:20,962
Rose, it's not only
about sharing facts.

542
01:00:21,065 --> 01:00:23,274
We-- We have to explore them.

543
01:00:23,378 --> 01:00:26,036
How they have impacted on you

544
01:00:26,139 --> 01:00:29,626
and how they might affect
Sofia.

545
01:00:29,729 --> 01:00:33,699
My daughter is
completely unaffected by this.

546
01:00:33,802 --> 01:00:36,287
Now I need the bathroom.

547
01:00:36,391 --> 01:00:40,637
I usually go with Sofia.
Is there someone who could...

548
01:00:42,777 --> 01:00:45,193
I will page Julieta.

549
01:00:45,296 --> 01:00:48,230
- Tell me, where is Sofia today?
- I don't know.

550
01:00:53,857 --> 01:00:59,932
Your name as a child
was Rose Ivy Kennedy.

551
01:01:00,035 --> 01:01:02,555
Yeah.

552
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:05,972
It was.

553
01:01:06,076 --> 01:01:08,285
And I changed it as soon
as I could.

554
01:01:11,529 --> 01:01:13,566
Where's Julieta?

555
01:01:25,336 --> 01:01:27,822
Oh, God.

556
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:45,115
Thank you.

557
01:01:48,532 --> 01:01:51,052
Ooh.

558
01:01:53,779 --> 01:01:56,022
- Should I?
- No. No, it's fine. Don't.

559
01:01:57,783 --> 01:01:59,646
Sofie, you're killing me.

560
01:02:01,856 --> 01:02:07,068
Hey, hey, I have
some riding boots for you.

561
01:02:08,759 --> 01:02:11,555
- Put them on.
- This is Leonardo.

562
01:02:11,658 --> 01:02:13,281
We saw a snake, Leonardo.

563
01:02:13,384 --> 01:02:15,110
Where's the snake?

564
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:23,325
Do I look like I need boots?

565
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:27,088
This is Sofie.

566
01:02:35,613 --> 01:02:37,098
Going back into town.

567
01:02:37,201 --> 01:02:39,169
I have my riding lessons
now, Sofie.

568
01:02:39,272 --> 01:02:41,067
Uh-huh.

569
01:02:41,171 --> 01:02:43,967
- You can't drive.
- I can, I fucking can!

570
01:03:04,539 --> 01:03:06,437
I was worried.

571
01:03:11,442 --> 01:03:15,792
Your father was often silent,
like you.

572
01:03:15,895 --> 01:03:17,517
For hours.

573
01:03:23,834 --> 01:03:25,387
I want to see him.

574
01:03:27,527 --> 01:03:30,530
What would you gain by that?

575
01:03:30,634 --> 01:03:32,601
I haven't seen him
in 11 years.

576
01:03:32,705 --> 01:03:34,776
Hmm?
Is it that long?

577
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:37,537
- Mm-hmm.
- He'll be the same.

578
01:03:39,470 --> 01:03:41,852
I've got a baby sister
I've never met.

579
01:03:48,755 --> 01:03:50,827
The notion of you
seeing your father

580
01:03:50,930 --> 01:03:53,001
is just a ridiculous idea.

581
01:04:03,149 --> 01:04:05,082
What is wrong with you?

582
01:04:06,704 --> 01:04:08,637
Nothing.

583
01:04:08,741 --> 01:04:10,639
Nothing's wrong with me.

584
01:04:13,194 --> 01:04:14,574
Okay.

585
01:04:34,111 --> 01:04:37,080
Sorry you had to wait
so long, Christos.

586
01:04:39,772 --> 01:04:42,395
You can call me Papa.

587
01:04:57,824 --> 01:05:00,862
Where do you live, Sofia?

588
01:05:00,966 --> 01:05:03,900
In London with my mother.

589
01:05:04,003 --> 01:05:06,040
Why Spain?

590
01:05:06,143 --> 01:05:09,319
She's seeing
a consultant there.

591
01:05:09,422 --> 01:05:12,943
Sofia's
mother feels pain acutely.

592
01:05:13,047 --> 01:05:15,428
She always did.

593
01:05:15,532 --> 01:05:17,327
It's real.

594
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:20,675
Do you speak Spanish?

595
01:05:20,778 --> 01:05:22,642
No.

596
01:05:22,746 --> 01:05:24,644
Do you speak Greek?

597
01:05:28,683 --> 01:05:30,478
How long will you stay?

598
01:05:34,896 --> 01:05:37,105
Just a few days.

599
01:05:37,209 --> 01:05:39,107
If that's okay.

600
01:05:55,986 --> 01:05:59,231
- Your hair thing.
- Oh, thanks.

601
01:06:01,474 --> 01:06:04,201
The window opens.
You want me to open it?

602
01:06:04,305 --> 01:06:05,892
No. It's okay.
I'll do it.

603
01:06:05,996 --> 01:06:07,653
Okay.

604
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:12,969
Good night.

605
01:06:13,072 --> 01:06:14,901
Night.

606
01:06:18,181 --> 01:06:21,460
- You look like Christos.
- Really?

607
01:06:21,563 --> 01:06:24,566
I have asked him about you
a lot.

608
01:06:24,670 --> 01:06:26,292
What did he say?

609
01:06:26,396 --> 01:06:28,191
He speaks about your mother.

610
01:06:28,294 --> 01:06:33,230
- Opa.
- How she found it hard.

611
01:06:33,334 --> 01:06:35,508
Being on her own
with a child.

612
01:06:35,612 --> 01:06:37,200
Not just that.

613
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:41,204
Have you been to
Greece before?

614
01:06:41,307 --> 01:06:43,585
Mm-hmm. When I was 15.

615
01:06:43,689 --> 01:06:46,554
Is it good to see your papa?

616
01:06:46,657 --> 01:06:49,246
Where did you two meet?

617
01:06:49,350 --> 01:06:52,353
Would you like to hold her?

618
01:06:54,389 --> 01:06:57,703
- Yeah, sure. Hi!
- This is your sister.

619
01:06:57,806 --> 01:07:00,361
Oh, yes.
Hello.

620
01:07:00,464 --> 01:07:02,673
Hi. Hi.

621
01:07:39,193 --> 01:07:41,712
- Sofia.
- Hi.

622
01:07:41,816 --> 01:07:42,851
Come.

623
01:07:45,682 --> 01:07:49,065
- I'll go check on Evangeline.
- Okay.

624
01:08:02,285 --> 01:08:04,390
People in their boxes.

625
01:08:06,737 --> 01:08:09,671
I like that everybody
goes to sleep at night.

626
01:08:13,986 --> 01:08:15,712
Rose finds sleep hard.

627
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:22,615
Two insomniacs
you have for parents,

628
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:25,135
who would make tea
in the middle of the night

629
01:08:25,239 --> 01:08:28,725
and listen to the radio
or play chess.

630
01:08:28,828 --> 01:08:32,384
You wanted to sleep on the roof
last time you were here.

631
01:08:32,487 --> 01:08:35,732
I'll let you fall asleep here.

632
01:08:37,458 --> 01:08:40,254
You were not happy on that trip.

633
01:08:40,357 --> 01:08:42,566
I was a bit scared of you.

634
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:49,021
What is this word?

635
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:51,092
"Beloved."

636
01:08:51,196 --> 01:08:53,405
What are you going to do?

637
01:08:53,508 --> 01:08:56,442
You can't be nursemaid
to Rose all your life.

638
01:08:56,546 --> 01:08:58,858
No. Um...

639
01:08:58,962 --> 01:09:01,102
I would like to finish
my doctorate in America.

640
01:09:01,206 --> 01:09:03,000
Do you need funding?
You want money?

641
01:09:03,104 --> 01:09:05,382
- That's not why I came.
- I don't have any.

642
01:09:05,486 --> 01:09:09,559
- I give it all away.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

643
01:09:11,492 --> 01:09:14,011
It was not all my fault,
you know.

644
01:09:14,115 --> 01:09:16,221
Your mother was difficult.

645
01:09:16,324 --> 01:09:18,015
Impossible.

646
01:09:19,534 --> 01:09:24,229
What has Rose told you
about her family?

647
01:09:24,332 --> 01:09:28,025
Said they didn't get on,
that they weren't close.

648
01:09:28,129 --> 01:09:30,131
Tell Rose
she needs to tell you--

649
01:09:32,547 --> 01:09:36,793
People should
not ring so late.

650
01:09:38,691 --> 01:09:41,763
"Beheaded."
It says "beheaded."

651
01:09:43,455 --> 01:09:45,388
No, it says beloved.

652
01:10:11,034 --> 01:10:13,692
- You're here!
- I just went to the hospital.

653
01:10:15,866 --> 01:10:18,317
But I-I didn't stay there.
You know, the pain,

654
01:10:18,421 --> 01:10:20,146
it wasn't chronic.

655
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:21,872
So you're okay?
You're discharged yourself?

656
01:10:21,976 --> 01:10:24,496
I was never admitted, 'Fia.
I-I just rang from there.

657
01:10:24,599 --> 01:10:27,395
You see, I went to see them
about the water

658
01:10:27,499 --> 01:10:31,365
because it is so bad here,
and I did not expect that.

659
01:10:31,468 --> 01:10:34,920
And then, they realized
that I was nearly passing out.

660
01:10:35,023 --> 01:10:36,370
Did you actually faint?

661
01:10:36,473 --> 01:10:39,649
Well, everyone was just
so wonderful.

662
01:10:39,752 --> 01:10:42,790
Just lovely people
and conversation.

663
01:10:42,893 --> 01:10:45,827
And the doctors.
And Matty drove me everywhere.

664
01:10:45,931 --> 01:10:50,349
And I-I don't want to see
Gomez anymore.

665
01:10:50,453 --> 01:10:52,765
You know, it's just not helpful.

666
01:10:52,869 --> 01:10:55,527
And I want to go home.
I mean, he just depresses me.

667
01:10:55,630 --> 01:10:57,943
And I have a different idea.

668
01:10:58,046 --> 01:11:01,429
So, tell me about Christos
and the child bride.

669
01:11:01,533 --> 01:11:04,674
It's dangerous
to become dehydrated.

670
01:11:04,777 --> 01:11:07,124
Which is
why I went to the hospital.

671
01:11:07,228 --> 01:11:08,747
You could have just drank
the water.

672
01:11:08,850 --> 01:11:10,473
Because it tastes like bleach
to me. Would you--

673
01:11:10,576 --> 01:11:11,853
It's from the mountains.

674
01:11:11,957 --> 01:11:13,648
It has a picture of the
mountains on the bottle.

675
01:11:13,752 --> 01:11:15,305
- Fuck that!
- What more do you want?

676
01:11:15,409 --> 01:11:17,307
It's a lie. I mean,
the mountains are a lie.

677
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:22,554
Sofia.

678
01:11:22,657 --> 01:11:25,350
No.

679
01:11:25,453 --> 01:11:28,560
- Sofia, come out.
- What do you want now?

680
01:11:28,663 --> 01:11:30,562
- I am in severe pain.
- Really?

681
01:11:30,665 --> 01:11:34,013
It's very bad.
And your father has upset you.

682
01:11:34,117 --> 01:11:35,877
Where's the pain?
Tell me.

683
01:11:35,981 --> 01:11:38,328
Well, I seem to have strained
sort of a ligament

684
01:11:38,432 --> 01:11:39,674
just in the chaos of it all.

685
01:11:39,778 --> 01:11:42,125
But this Dr. Shah there,
she--

686
01:11:42,228 --> 01:11:43,989
she gave me some new
medication,

687
01:11:44,092 --> 01:11:46,440
but it's just making
me feel very nauseous.

688
01:11:46,543 --> 01:11:49,995
Anyway, I've got to try
and finish up with,

689
01:11:50,098 --> 01:11:51,962
uh, Gomez tomorrow.

690
01:11:52,066 --> 01:11:55,069
I'm going to ask for some
of the money back.

691
01:11:55,172 --> 01:11:59,349
I mean, you don't pay
thousands of euros for a chat.

692
01:11:59,453 --> 01:12:02,663
And we're going to have to ask
for a taxi

693
01:12:02,766 --> 01:12:05,424
because Matty needs the car.

694
01:12:05,528 --> 01:12:07,668
Fuck Matty.
Fuck all of them.

695
01:12:07,771 --> 01:12:10,118
Fucking Matty.

696
01:12:13,052 --> 01:12:15,400
Give me your paw.

697
01:12:15,503 --> 01:12:17,954
Go on, give it to me.

698
01:12:24,443 --> 01:12:26,065
Tell me about your father.

699
01:12:30,725 --> 01:12:32,727
He told me you two played chess

700
01:12:32,831 --> 01:12:34,936
when you couldn't sleep
at night.

701
01:12:38,043 --> 01:12:40,286
We didn't.

702
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:42,219
Christos always slept.

703
01:12:42,323 --> 01:12:43,842
He snored.

704
01:12:43,945 --> 01:12:47,604
The chess is some narrative
of his, some fiction.

705
01:12:49,399 --> 01:12:52,057
He also said you
should tell me what happened.

706
01:12:55,129 --> 01:12:56,820
In what sense?

707
01:12:56,924 --> 01:12:58,995
He was talking about
your family.

708
01:13:01,031 --> 01:13:03,758
He never met my family.

709
01:13:03,862 --> 01:13:06,761
You see, that's what he does.
He lies.

710
01:13:10,696 --> 01:13:13,630
You need to work more
on what we talked of.

711
01:13:13,734 --> 01:13:15,391
If you don't,
you won't walk freely.

712
01:13:15,494 --> 01:13:17,703
I don't want to do
any more work on it.

713
01:13:17,807 --> 01:13:19,981
- I don't feel the need.
- Are you scared?

714
01:13:20,085 --> 01:13:22,743
It's natural,
but you have to fight that fear.

715
01:13:22,846 --> 01:13:24,607
I feel better
since I went to the hospital.

716
01:13:24,710 --> 01:13:27,023
There's a normality about it
which I appreciate.

717
01:13:27,126 --> 01:13:28,680
You're happy
to suppress the event,

718
01:13:28,783 --> 01:13:30,751
I understand that,
but you need to know

719
01:13:30,854 --> 01:13:32,787
who you are in real detail.

720
01:13:32,891 --> 01:13:36,446
And you have to find
the answer and accept it.

721
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:39,207
Julieta will take me
to the taxi, thank you.

722
01:13:39,311 --> 01:13:42,866
Rose. Rose. Rose, please.

723
01:13:44,799 --> 01:13:46,594
Rose.

724
01:13:48,665 --> 01:13:53,118
What you are contemplating,
it will not help.

725
01:13:59,124 --> 01:14:00,884
We didn't talk about money.

726
01:14:04,543 --> 01:14:06,856
I will refund what
you ask for.

727
01:14:09,548 --> 01:14:11,101
Excuse me.

728
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,243
Sofia Irina,
please stay a moment.

729
01:14:17,901 --> 01:14:20,041
Your mother was progressing,
but she has gone into

730
01:14:20,145 --> 01:14:22,699
a fight or flight
and has chosen the latter.

731
01:14:26,254 --> 01:14:30,638
Your mother has proposed
something quite... brutal.

732
01:14:30,742 --> 01:14:34,987
When you were away,
she talked about amputation.

733
01:14:38,370 --> 01:14:41,097
She's not serious about that.
She wants to get better.

734
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:44,134
I cannot stop her from
wanting to staunch the pain.

735
01:14:44,238 --> 01:14:46,274
She has made an appointment
with a consultant in London.

736
01:14:46,378 --> 01:14:47,897
No.

737
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,554
He had confirmed it with me

738
01:14:49,657 --> 01:14:51,970
and has asked for her records.

739
01:15:16,684 --> 01:15:18,859
Tell me...

740
01:15:21,551 --> 01:15:24,727
...h-how did you go with
your father?

741
01:15:27,764 --> 01:15:31,354
It was good to see him again.

742
01:15:31,457 --> 01:15:33,425
Was he cruel to you?

743
01:15:36,048 --> 01:15:39,604
Well, you don't have to see
him again.

744
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:43,918
Ever.
Sofia, hmm?

745
01:15:44,022 --> 01:15:47,957
You never have
to see him again.

746
01:16:00,210 --> 01:16:01,902
Okay.

747
01:16:11,532 --> 01:16:15,225
What are you doing?
Get in.

748
01:16:15,329 --> 01:16:18,366
Get in, Sofia, get in!

749
01:16:18,470 --> 01:16:21,059
Having a tantrum is not helpful.

750
01:16:38,317 --> 01:16:39,940
Dog?

751
01:16:42,114 --> 01:16:43,599
Dog!

752
01:17:06,932 --> 01:17:09,694
Come, sit down, Sofie.

753
01:17:09,797 --> 01:17:12,731
- I don't want to.
- Please.

754
01:17:12,835 --> 01:17:15,113
You'll regret it if you don't.

755
01:17:30,128 --> 01:17:31,992
Sofie.

756
01:17:35,754 --> 01:17:38,308
Mm, Sofie.

757
01:17:40,621 --> 01:17:45,868
You're like a blue planet
with two dark, spooky eyes.

758
01:17:45,971 --> 01:17:48,456
Like little animals.

759
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,355
No, I'm not.

760
01:17:50,458 --> 01:17:52,460
I'm none of those things.

761
01:17:55,394 --> 01:17:57,673
Are you hungry?

762
01:17:57,776 --> 01:18:00,710
I bet you want to eat pizza.
Hmm?

763
01:18:02,712 --> 01:18:04,956
You're a monster, Sofie.

764
01:18:14,620 --> 01:18:17,002
Do you think...

765
01:18:17,106 --> 01:18:20,730
she's happy without a mind?

766
01:18:23,422 --> 01:18:25,770
Do you think

767
01:18:25,873 --> 01:18:29,601
she remembers?

768
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:33,916
She has a mind like a leaf.

769
01:18:39,473 --> 01:18:41,786
Sometimes I want to...

770
01:18:41,889 --> 01:18:45,513
blow myself up, Sofie.

771
01:18:45,617 --> 01:18:48,344
Do you still like me?

772
01:18:50,104 --> 01:18:51,865
Say yes.

773
01:18:51,968 --> 01:18:55,144
The world is dark
until you say yes.

774
01:18:57,905 --> 01:19:00,321
The world is so dark.

775
01:19:00,425 --> 01:19:02,841
So dark.

776
01:19:09,399 --> 01:19:12,230
Wait.

777
01:19:12,333 --> 01:19:15,095
Oh, Matty.

778
01:19:15,198 --> 01:19:19,030
Matty, can you hear the ocean?

779
01:19:19,133 --> 01:19:20,548
Listen.

780
01:19:20,652 --> 01:19:22,585
Hey!

781
01:19:22,688 --> 01:19:26,382
Hey! That's my--

782
01:19:26,485 --> 01:19:27,935
My phone!

783
01:19:28,039 --> 01:19:30,489
- You go get my phone.
- You get your fucking phone!

784
01:19:30,593 --> 01:19:33,838
- Go get my phone! Go!
- Ingrid, it's not a phone!

785
01:19:36,047 --> 01:19:38,981
You were children.

786
01:19:39,084 --> 01:19:40,983
You were children.

787
01:19:43,399 --> 01:19:45,435
You were children.

788
01:20:22,024 --> 01:20:24,543
Hola. Hola, Hola.

789
01:20:24,647 --> 01:20:26,614
Juntos.

790
01:20:29,479 --> 01:20:31,447
Juntos. Juntos. Juntos.

791
01:20:31,550 --> 01:20:32,793
Ahora, ahora.

792
01:20:32,897 --> 01:20:35,037
- Ya està.
- Ya està.

793
01:21:37,996 --> 01:21:40,309
What did you do
when you got home today?

794
01:21:40,412 --> 01:21:41,897
Nothing.

795
01:21:44,761 --> 01:21:46,522
So you didn't go out
or anything?

796
01:21:46,625 --> 01:21:48,524
No, I just slept.

797
01:21:48,627 --> 01:21:50,250
Why?

798
01:21:54,530 --> 01:21:57,705
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's go where?

799
01:21:57,809 --> 01:22:00,018
Can I have some water?

800
01:22:00,122 --> 01:22:02,400
Tell me about
your sister, Mum.

801
01:22:02,503 --> 01:22:04,229
Mary.

802
01:22:06,266 --> 01:22:07,681
She died.

803
01:22:07,784 --> 01:22:10,166
Would you help me fix
the lamp in my bedroom?

804
01:22:10,270 --> 01:22:11,996
How did she die, exactly?

805
01:22:12,099 --> 01:22:16,034
I-I don't know.
Will you just plug it in for me?

806
01:22:16,138 --> 01:22:17,933
You must know how she died.

807
01:22:18,036 --> 01:22:19,969
I don't.

808
01:22:23,248 --> 01:22:25,250
I didn't know her.

809
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:31,877
I didn't know her.

810
01:22:31,981 --> 01:22:33,983
Please tell me.

811
01:22:38,850 --> 01:22:41,370
Just did.

812
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:45,719
All right, get in the car.

813
01:22:45,822 --> 01:22:48,998
God, I don't know what is
the matter with you, 'Fia.

814
01:22:49,102 --> 01:22:50,758
I'm hungry. We're going to
the restaurant. Come on.

815
01:22:50,862 --> 01:22:53,623
- No, I-I--
- Let's go! Go, go!

816
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:02,494
What is this?

817
01:23:02,598 --> 01:23:04,324
You walked today.

818
01:23:09,053 --> 01:23:10,916
Why didn't you tell me?

819
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:14,817
I didn't want to raise
your hopes.

820
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:17,993
I watch you as closely
as you watch me.

821
01:23:18,096 --> 01:23:21,617
It's what mothers do.
We watch our children.

822
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:24,137
You never ask me
if I'm happy.

823
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:27,485
Because you're
always so profoundly sad.

824
01:23:27,588 --> 01:23:30,074
- You ask for so much of me!
- Is that not so?

825
01:23:30,177 --> 01:23:33,008
- So much!
- Because you are so able.

826
01:23:33,111 --> 01:23:34,733
You're so strong.

827
01:23:34,837 --> 01:23:38,668
And why would you
talk about cutting off your leg?

828
01:23:38,772 --> 01:23:41,395
That's too...

829
01:23:43,052 --> 01:23:44,743
Too late. It's all gone.

830
01:24:02,623 --> 01:24:04,556
Mary didn't die.

831
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:10,079
They sent her away.

832
01:24:13,669 --> 01:24:15,740
She was 16.

833
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:21,573
She had me.

834
01:24:24,956 --> 01:24:27,096
I was hers.

835
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:34,655
They didn't let her
near me.

836
01:24:41,317 --> 01:24:45,770
Did you know her?
Did you meet later?

837
01:24:48,945 --> 01:24:50,568
Yeah, once.

838
01:24:50,671 --> 01:24:52,673
When I was your age.

839
01:24:57,264 --> 01:24:59,508
She wasn't well.

840
01:25:03,132 --> 01:25:04,892
She was broken.

841
01:25:14,281 --> 01:25:16,973
Doesn't matter.

842
01:25:17,077 --> 01:25:20,253
I'm an animal in the desert.

843
01:25:23,290 --> 01:25:25,120
And there's no water.

844
01:25:28,157 --> 01:25:29,745
There is water.

845
01:25:32,265 --> 01:25:34,405
It's too late.

846
01:25:35,716 --> 01:25:37,787
There's only pain.

847
01:25:52,595 --> 01:25:55,046
Okay. Okay.

848
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:57,290
Come on.

849
01:25:57,393 --> 01:26:01,535
Okay.

850
01:26:01,639 --> 01:26:03,882
All right.

851
01:26:07,886 --> 01:26:09,957
All right.

852
01:26:15,239 --> 01:26:17,655
It's not too late.

853
01:26:17,758 --> 01:26:19,208
It's here.

854
01:26:19,312 --> 01:26:22,694
Okay? It's here.

855
01:26:22,798 --> 01:26:25,594
You have to choose, Mama.
You have to choose.

856
01:26:25,697 --> 01:26:27,872
You have
to choose to go outside.

857
01:26:27,975 --> 01:26:30,357
You have to choose
to not sit in a room all day

858
01:26:30,461 --> 01:26:33,257
and die slowly smelling
of that room.

859
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:37,122
Do you understand? Please.
You have to embrace life.

860
01:26:37,226 --> 01:26:38,745
You can't just endure it.[

861
01:26:41,230 --> 01:26:43,715
Do you hear me?

862
01:26:55,831 --> 01:26:58,385
I-- I can't walk, 'Fia.

863
01:27:00,145 --> 01:27:01,526
You have to choose, Mama.

864
01:27:01,630 --> 01:27:04,253
I-I-- You've got to believe me,
I can't walk.

865
01:27:05,634 --> 01:27:07,498
You don't believe me,
but I can't.

866
01:27:07,601 --> 01:27:09,603
I do believe you.
I do.

00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:11,220
[haunting music playing]

4
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:37,121
[dramatic music playing]

5
00:00:56,432 --> 00:00:58,434
[haunting music playing]

6
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:34,303
[Perfidia] Welcome.

7
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:41,352
Our best guess, there's about
250, 275 people in there.

8
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:42,728
It's hard to count.

9
00:01:42,812 --> 00:01:45,147
We need to be prepared
for, like, 300 people

10
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:47,107
by the time we get there, right?

11
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:48,984
Our cargo container,

12
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:53,113
18-wheeler, that thing
only holds 160 people.

13
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:54,657
I'm talking 'bout crammed
in there tight...

14
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,242
[Sommerville] That's cheek to jowl.

15
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:57,785
...smashed face to face.

16
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:59,620
Women and children first.

17
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,997
[Laredo] Listen,
whoever's not on with us,

18
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:03,582
- they just run, on foot.
- [Talleyrand] Just go.

19
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,835
[Laredo] That's it.
If they're not with us, they run.

20
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:08,003
[Deandra] Via de la Amistad,
that's our exit route.

21
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:11,298
Runs east-west.
It's about one mile from 905.

22
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:13,509
- [Laredo] Right.
- What you draggin' in that wagon?

23
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:15,845
[breathing heavily] Listen, I got HMEs.

24
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:18,222
I got mortars, I got tear gas,
I got whatever you guys need,

25
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:21,183
but I'm a little unclear
as to what the plan is.

26
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:23,435
- I'm gonna need some direction.
- Don't be unclear.

27
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:26,105
- I got a plan for us.
- Well, what is it?

28
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:27,439
I mean, you want me
to create a diversion?

29
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:28,607
You want me to blow something up?

30
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:29,692
What do you want?

31
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:33,153
I want you to create a show, Pat.

32
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:37,199
Okay? This is the announcement
of the motherfuckin' revolution.

33
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:39,702
- Yeah.
- Make it good. Make it bright.

34
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:40,870
Impress me.

35
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:42,955
[Laredo] Team Two's entrance.
We got that?

36
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,248
[Deandra] Yep.
That runs north and south.

37
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,416
[Laredo] Perfect, perfect, perfect.

38
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,001
- [Perfidia] Give Pat a walkie.
- [Mae West] Gimme a walkie.

39
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,586
[Sommerville] Big truck
coming up Enrico Fermi...

40
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:49,879
- Channel five.
- Copy that.

41
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:51,797
Yeah! It's game time.
No more talking 'bout this.

42
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:52,965
- Let's go!
- All right, let's go,

43
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,216
- let's go, let's go.
- Let's fuckin' go.

44
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,350
[whispers] Watch, watch, watch.

45
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,405
[Junglepussy] Get on your knees,
like you 'bout to suck a dick.

46
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,626
Gate guard secure.

47
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,518
[Talleyrand] Hey, you.
Get up. Hands up. Get up.

48
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:52,399
- Down. Hey you, get up.
- [Mae West] Get your hands up.

49
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:54,234
- Wake up. All the way up!
- Down on the ground.

50
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:55,319
[Sylvia] Hands up. Don't look at me.

51
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,487
- All the way up.
- Wake up.

52
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,572
[unnerving music playing]

53
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:35,025
[Perfidia] Wake up, soldier boy.

54
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:38,570
You died and went
to pussy heaven, motherfucker.

55
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:41,031
Put your arms to the side
so I can see you.

56
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:43,826
[speaking Spanish]

57
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:50,332
[in English] What's your name, dickhead?

58
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,964
I'm Captain Steven J. Lockjaw.

59
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,758
My name is Perfidia Beverly Hills,

60
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:01,468
and this is a declaration of war.

61
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,680
We're here to right your wrongs,
motherfucker.

62
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,390
You got an army growin'
in your fuckin' guts,

63
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,891
and you put it there.

64
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:09,977
You didn't count on me.

65
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,062
- [whispers] Oh, my God.
- You didn't count on my fight.

66
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,565
The message is clear.

67
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,483
Free borders, free bodies, free choices,

68
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:18,068
and free from fuckin' fear!

69
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,739
Sweet thing.

70
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:24,616
Is this funny?

71
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:26,827
[Lockjaw] Mm.

72
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:30,247
Get up.

73
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,543
Not on your feet.

74
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:36,587
[chuckles]

75
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,839
Oh, not on your fuckin' feet.

76
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:44,219
Since we playin'...

77
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:46,513
get it up.

78
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:51,185
Up.

79
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:53,896
Yeah.

80
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:56,523
Get it up.

81
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,734
[indistinct shouting]

82
00:05:58,817 --> 00:05:59,818
[Deandra] Guys, hurry up!

83
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:04,239
Be careful! Hurry, hurry, hurry!

84
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:06,784
<i>Apurarse.</i> Hurry, hurry, hurry!
But be careful!

85
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,869
Be careful!
All the way to the back.

86
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:10,829
[whispers] Holy shit.

87
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,751
[man] Keep it moving now.

88
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:17,586
Up.

89
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:20,172
Good boy.

90
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:23,008
- [Lockjaw moans]
- [Perfidia] Mm.

91
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:25,511
You like lockin' people up, huh?

92
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,680
- Mm.
- [Lockjaw] Oh, yeah.

93
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,809
- [Lockjaw moans]
- Get on your fuckin' knees!

94
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,435
Now.

95
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:35,979
Let's go, let's go.

96
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,982
Put it on.

97
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,778
- Let's go!
- [grunts]

98
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,577
Now get the fuck up.

99
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:55,874
Let's go. Hands up.
Keep that dick up.

100
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,209
- [grunts]
- Keep it up.

101
00:06:58,335 --> 00:06:59,336
The fuck out.

102
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,340
[Lockjaw grunts]

103
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,343
Pat.

104
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,427
[Pat over radio] <i>Go for Pat.</i>

105
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,680
[Perfidia] <i>Snap, crackle, pop, baby.</i>

106
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:10,806
Copy that.

107
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:17,396
[indistinct chatter]

108
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:20,607
[Pat] Come on, come on!

109
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:25,863
I declare war, motherfucker.

110
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,948
[uneasy music playing]

111
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:43,172
I'll be seeing you very soon.

112
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,717
Not if I see you first, fuck face.

113
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:50,679
[inhales, exhales]

114
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:55,017
[Pat shouts]
We are a political organization

115
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,436
that is free from the eyes,

116
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,521
the ears, and most importantly,

117
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:02,274
the weapons of the imperialist state,

118
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,193
and this fascist regime!

119
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:09,239
You are a political prisoner
of the French 75, motherfuckers!

120
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,326
You've been captured by the French 75!

121
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:14,286
[speaking Spanish]

122
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,787
[in English] Fuck the police!

123
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,123
<i>- ¡Viva la revolución!</i>
- [in English] Let's go!

124
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,210
[Pat speaking Spanish]

125
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:25,005
[in English] Motherfuckers, <i>órale!</i>

126
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,341
[Perfidia] Wait! Wait, wait, wait!

127
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,551
- Hold on, y'all, hold on.
- [Pat] Shit. Oh, shit.

128
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:31,053
[Perfidia] Where you get
all this energy from?

129
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,512
- What are you talkin' about?
- [women laughing]

130
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:34,139
I'm getting Ghetto Pat tonight.
I think I like you.

131
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:35,682
- You like Black girls?
- [Pat] Mm-hmm.

132
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:36,850
- Yeah?
- Do I like what?

133
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:38,644
- You like... [moans]
- [Pat moans]

134
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:40,395
Y'all think he like Black girls?
Y'all think he like me?

135
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,231
- [Junglepussy] I think he does.
- 'Course I fuckin' like Black girls!

136
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:43,732
So shoot this shit up! Let's go!

137
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,359
What the fuck
do you think I'm doing here?

138
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,069
- [Perfidia] Let's go!
- [Junglepussy] Fuck your mother!

139
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,695
[Pat] You know
I like fuckin' Black girls!

140
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:49,905
You know I like Black girls.

141
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,657
And I love you. You love me?
Tell me you love me.

142
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,200
- Tell me you fuckin' love me.
- I love you.

143
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,285
- [both moaning]
- [women laughing]

144
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,122
Calm down. Calm the fuck down.

145
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,585
What I'm doing here

146
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:06,380
is I'm creating a closed circuit

147
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:11,343
to remove any static electricity.

148
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:16,682
And that right there...

149
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:20,269
That's a shunt. You see that?

150
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:21,353
Yeah.

151
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:23,814
[Pat] This is your blasting cap.

152
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:24,898
[Perfidia] Mm.

153
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:26,858
[Pat] Right here.

154
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:34,533
Very important to keep
your cap shunted like this

155
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,493
when you enter the courthouse.
You got that?

156
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,289
Here's your main charge.

157
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:42,416
This is your cell phone.

158
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,752
[Perfidia] Don't stop.
I see the cell phone.

159
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,214
First thing you're gonna do
is you're gonna turn on your cell phone

160
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:51,925
without your...

161
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,303
without your cap attached...

162
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:57,597
so you don't accidentally
detonate your charge.

163
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,183
You're gonna wanna...

164
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:03,520
You're gonna wanna
put your hands here, right?

165
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,897
- Mmm.
- And then you wanna

166
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:07,816
take your hands and the cap

167
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,278
and throw it in the circle.

168
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:14,323
<i>Senator Wilson,</i>
<i>this is a warning for you.</i>

169
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,325
We planted a bomb
at the Haymarket office

170
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:18,452
of your re-election campaign.

171
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:22,289
We warned you, that abortion ban,
and you didn't wanna fuckin' listen.

172
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:25,751
So, for my sisters in need,
we will strike.

173
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:29,338
Sincerely yours,
Perfidia Beverly Hills, motherfucker.

174
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:36,219
<i>Revolutionary violence is the only way.</i>

175
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:37,971

Okay? Rule of thumb

find somebody else out there

can you get me some towels?

416
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:18,846
[Minnie] Yeah. All right.

00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:21,182

Otherwise, no phones.

- Okay.
- If the towers are up,

424
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:32,318
we're gonna be able to find
each other in any case.

425

You spend a week in Denver.

429

in childbirth last month.

436

down the line if we don't do this.

Teachin' the right kind
of history, I hope.

[teacher] Mm-hmm.

[Bob] I see you got
all the greats here, huh?

532
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:29,711
Oh, yeah.

533
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,421
What were his intentions?

534
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:34,758
Got Teddy Roosevelt over there.
You got...

Hope you teach about
the Philippines and all that.

536

We don't get all
into the details just yet,

537
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:42,182
- but we don't hide from them, either.
- You should.

538
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:44,017
[Bob] You should.
Gotta tell the truth.

539
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:48,647
And then you got
the Grand Wizard over there, right?

540
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,649
- Mr. Benjamin Franklin.
- [teacher] Mm.

541
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:52,317
Forefather.

542
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:54,069
- Hm?
- [teacher] Mm.

here in the classroom.

- Thanks.

00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:09,459

00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:12,421
Willa's doing really great.

[Bob] Mm.

[teacher] She's a confident leader.

- Mm-hmm.
- [teacher] She works hard.

552
00:36:18,135 --> 00:36:22,347
You can tell that she actually cares
about being a good student, you know?

553
00:36:22,431 --> 00:36:26,226
She enters class each day
ready to work, full of energy.

- tears of joy, that's all.

I see this is very emotional for you.

I don't know...

562
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:50,375
You know, Willa grew up without her mom.

563
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:53,295
Her mom died
when she was very young.

564
00:36:53,921 --> 00:36:56,131
[teacher] Oh. I see.

565
00:36:57,299 --> 00:36:58,300
[Bob] Hm.

566
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:00,636
[teacher] So Willa never
knew her mother?

567
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,846
No. She never did.

568
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:05,682

on a young woman.

[Lockjaw] What do you got, Skinner?

Sir, Deputy Director of Progress
has orders to speak to you, sir.

575
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:54,523
Your transportation is set
for 1800 hours, sir.

576
00:37:55,649 --> 00:37:57,567
You know what this is about, Skinner?

577
00:37:57,651 --> 00:37:59,486
- [Skinner] No, sir, I'm...
- Well, I think I do.

578
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:03,532
That'll be all, Lieutenant.

thanks for coming.

585
00:39:09,306 --> 00:39:10,515
[Lockjaw] Sandy, great to see you.

586
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:12,225
[Sandy] Let me introduce you
to Virgil Throckmorton.

587
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:14,394
- Virgil, Colonel Steve Lockjaw.
- Steve Lockjaw.

588
00:39:14,478 --> 00:39:16,104
- How do you do, Colonel?
- My pleasure, sir.

589
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:18,732
Yeah, I'm sorry about all the espionage
at the back entrance.

590
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:20,901
My daughter's getting married
and dress was formal.

591
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:22,402
So, we didn't want you
to feel out of place.

592
00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:23,653
Perfectly understandable, sir.

593
00:39:23,737 --> 00:39:24,738
[Virgil] Please, sit.

594
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:27,282
Shane Mitchell sends a hello.

595
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,827
The big dog.
He still building out that garage?

596
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:32,788
[Sandy] The construction project
that never ends.

597
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,956
I'm sure he'll get it done.
Will you give him my best?

598
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,124
- [Sandy] Will do.
- Thank you.

599
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:37,626
How was your journey
from Rio Duarte?

600
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:38,710
[Lockjaw] Fine, sir.

601
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:39,836
You're doing great work down there.

602
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,004
[Lockjaw] Thank you very much, sir.

603
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:42,923
Each and every day
is hand-to-hand combat

604
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:45,008
in the spread
of uncontrolled migration, isn't it?

605
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:47,344
- Yes, it is, sir.
- [Virgil] Yeah.

606
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:50,972
Well, "You wanna save the planet,
you start with immigration."

607
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:52,474
That's exactly right, sir.

608
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:54,726
You said that.

609
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:56,937
A few years back,
after Squatting Pebble.

610
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,105
- [Lockjaw] Ah.
- [chuckles]

611
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:04,945
I understand you've expressed
an interest in us.

612
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:07,489
[Lockjaw] Yes, sir, I have.

613
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:10,992
And does it honor you to be considered
for membership in our club?

614
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:14,538
It's a very deep honor, sir.
Yes, it is.

615
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:18,375
Steve, we have, in the past,

616
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:21,837
offered membership
to certain members of the military.

617
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,340
We found their tactical
battlefield expertise

618
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,551
to be quite useful.

619
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:30,720
Now, our aim and your aim is the same.

620
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:33,348
To find dangerous lunatics,

621
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,810
haters, and punk trash
and stop them.

622
00:40:38,562 --> 00:40:40,313
No more lunatics.

623
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:42,357
[Lockjaw] Mm.

624
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,484
[Sandy] Now, I'm not sure
if you've heard or not,

625
00:40:44,568 --> 00:40:46,778
but Jim Kringle passed away.

626
00:40:46,862 --> 00:40:48,113
[Lockjaw] Oh, I did hear that, yes.

627
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:51,074
This means an opening.

628
00:40:51,158 --> 00:40:53,368
- [Lockjaw] Mm.
- Colonel,

629
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,454
I don't think I'm being immodest
when I say

630
00:40:56,538 --> 00:40:59,040
that joining
the Christmas Adventurers Club

631
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:02,294
means that you are a superior man.

632
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:06,298
No, not the best man,
not the most intelligent,

633
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:09,092
the most sophisticated,
or the wisest.

634
00:41:09,176 --> 00:41:12,512
It just means that you are superior
to other human beings,

635
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:15,307
and you shall never want for riches

636
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,100
or the greatest of friends.

637
00:41:18,018 --> 00:41:22,147
Now, we report to ourselves
with a freedom to be creative

638
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,858
and cut through layers of bureaucracy.

639
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:26,818
We live by the Golden Rule,

640
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:29,905
in a network
of like-minded men and women

641
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:32,449
dedicated to makin' the world
safe and pure.

642
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:37,579
What would you say
to someone who believes

643
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:41,458
that you have been soft
in your duty to racial purification?

644
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:46,713
I would say they are a liar
who has no business in society.

645
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:49,549
Or on the planet, for that matter. Mm.

646
00:41:49,633 --> 00:41:50,800
[chuckles]

647
00:41:50,884 --> 00:41:53,637
- Do you presently live with a spouse?
- [Lockjaw] No, sir.

648
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,556
Have you ever consulted
with a mental health professional?

649
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,641
[Lockjaw] No, sir.

650
00:41:57,724 --> 00:42:00,936
Have you ever had any bills or debts
turned over to a collection agency?

651
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:03,772
Mm. Well, I did purchase a jet ski.

652
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:07,984
It was an evolution
of the old Hummingbird Whisperdoo 238.

653
00:42:08,068 --> 00:42:10,362
Called the Dynamite Dolphin 335.

654
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:11,529
It was defective.

655
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:14,783
I abstained from payment.
I'd do it again. I have no regrets.

656
00:42:15,784 --> 00:42:16,868
Okay.

657
00:42:18,078 --> 00:42:20,455
Have you ever knowingly engaged

658
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,791
in any acts of terrorism
against this country?

659
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,292
No, sir.

660
00:42:25,627 --> 00:42:28,755
Have you ever engaged
in an interracial relationship?

661
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:30,423
No, sir.

662
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:33,760
[Virgil] And you are
American-born by gentile?

663
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:34,844
Yes, sir.

664
00:42:36,638 --> 00:42:37,639
Mm-hmm.

665
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:41,268
Now, to avoid any misunderstanding,

666
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:45,146
we require absolute secrecy
through the initiation process

667
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,816
to judge how serious
and unselfish you are.

668
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:49,401
- You understand?
- Mm-hmm.

669
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:53,196
And to be considered to a vote,

670
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,908
you must submit
to a voluntary vulnerability study.

671
00:42:56,992 --> 00:42:59,661
This identifies anything problematic
in your character.

672
00:43:00,287 --> 00:43:01,705
What could be a problem?

673
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,166
[Virgil] I don't know.
What could be a problem?

674
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,210
Absolutely nothing.

675
00:43:07,294 --> 00:43:09,004
We wanna know
who we're standing with.

676
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:10,338
[Lockjaw] Sure.

677
00:43:10,422 --> 00:43:14,968
Now, it's a Double Yankee
White Inquisitions <i>Completum.</i>

678
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:17,470
So if you have any doubt
as to your ability

679
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:18,888
to qualify in body or character

680
00:43:18,972 --> 00:43:21,266
as a member
of the Christmas Adventurers Club,

681
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:24,185
now you have an opportunity to say so.

682
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:29,691
- Do you wish to withdraw?
- No, sir.

683
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:31,860
Do you submit yourself?

684
00:43:32,736 --> 00:43:35,739
Yes, sir. I submit myself.

685
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:37,949
Very well, then.

686
00:43:39,743 --> 00:43:41,786
Now Sandy and I have
to get down to cut the cake.

687
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:42,871
Oh.

688
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:46,124
Congratulations
on your daughter's wedding.

689
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:48,460
[Virgil] Thank you. We'll be in touch.

690
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:49,878

Well, I don't remember
the fuckin' greeting code

01:10:18,298 --> 01:10:19,341
Here, use my phone.

1200
01:10:19,424 --> 01:10:20,884
I can't, I can't.
They'll trace that phone.

1201
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:22,260
I gotta use my phone.

1202
01:10:22,344 --> 01:10:24,054
Let's do that at my place, huh?
We gotta go.

1203
01:10:24,512 --> 01:10:25,513
Your place?

1204
01:10:25,597 --> 01:10:27,432
- Yeah.
- You got a gun at your place?

1205
01:10:27,515 --> 01:10:28,391
I'll get you a gun.

1206
01:10:28,475 --> 01:10:30,310
- You have a gun, right?
- Okay? Yes.

1207
01:10:30,393 --> 01:10:33,813
- Okay.
- Right now, it's a goddamn roundup.

1208
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:35,982
I gotta deal with this shit.

1209
01:10:36,066 --> 01:10:37,776
Okay. Yeah, let's, let's...

1210
01:10:37,859 --> 01:10:40,028
- Let's take that to go. Come on.
- Let's go to your place.

1211
01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:42,155
Let's go to your place.
I'll charge my phone.

1212
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:43,782
- You got a gun there.
- Bob, Bob, Bob.

1213
01:10:43,865 --> 01:10:45,867
- What? What?
- Get off the tatami.

1214
01:10:45,951 --> 01:10:47,827
- Okay. Yeah.

1215
01:10:47,911 --> 01:10:49,120
- Breathe.
- All right.

1216
01:10:49,204 --> 01:10:51,039
Okay? Cool out.

1217
01:10:51,790 --> 01:10:53,416
Ocean waves. Ocean waves.

1218
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:54,709
- Ocean waves.
- Let's go.

1219
01:10:54,793 --> 01:10:57,045
Let's go. I'll follow you.
Come on.

1220
01:10:58,421 --> 01:11:00,382
[speaking Spanish]

1221
01:11:04,094 --> 01:11:07,681
[siren blaring]

1222
01:11:08,223 --> 01:11:10,600
[in English] Got a little Latino
Harriet Tubman situation

1223
01:11:10,684 --> 01:11:11,810
going on at my place.

1224
01:11:11,893 --> 01:11:13,979
All legit, from the heart.
No cash.

1225
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:15,689
Here, use my phone.

1226
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:17,899
No, no. No, no, man,

1227
01:11:17,983 --> 01:11:19,526
You understand?
They trace those calls.

1228
01:11:20,235 --> 01:11:22,070
- What's with the shades?
- Fuck.

1229
01:11:22,153 --> 01:11:23,905
[siren blaring]

1230
01:11:23,989 --> 01:11:26,366
Look, me and Willa's mom,
we used to run around

1231
01:11:26,449 --> 01:11:28,201
and do some real bad shit together,
all right?

1232
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:30,370
We were part of the French 75.

1233
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:32,497
They got her,
now they're comin' after us.

1234
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:33,707
Fuck.

1235
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:35,959
[siren blaring]

1236
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:38,461
You're a bad <i>hombre</i>, Bob.

1237
01:11:39,754 --> 01:11:41,548
[tense music continues]

1238
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:45,593
[officer] Sit down.

1239
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:50,432

1242
01:11:54,561 --> 01:11:56,396
[Danvers] Bluto.
Nice to meet you, Bluto.

1243
01:11:56,479 --> 01:11:57,939
Do ya mind
if I have your phone?

1244
01:11:58,023 --> 01:11:58,982
Go ahead and unlock it for me.

1245
01:11:59,899 --> 01:12:02,777
Thank you. Hey, sorry
for crashin' the party like we did

1246
01:12:02,861 --> 01:12:04,529
but we have a few questions
we wanna ask ya.

1247
01:12:04,612 --> 01:12:06,322
- Is that all right with you?
- Sure.

1248
01:12:06,406 --> 01:12:07,991
- You're shakin'. Are you okay?
- [Bobo] I'm fine.

1249
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:09,451
- You nervous?
- Little bit.

1250
01:12:09,534 --> 01:12:11,036
- Do you need anything?
- No, we're good.

1251
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:13,413
If you tell me the truth,
you're outta here in ten seconds.

1252
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:14,998
- Yes, sir.
- [Danvers] If you lie to me,

1253
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:16,082
we're gonna have
some problems.

1254
01:12:16,166 --> 01:12:17,000
Yes, sir.

1255
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:18,710
You know Willa Ferguson,
right?

1256
01:12:18,793 --> 01:12:20,712
- [Bobo] I do.
- How do you know her?

1257
01:12:20,795 --> 01:12:21,755
We're good friends.

1258
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:23,798
Okay. Do you know
where she is right now?

1259
01:12:23,882 --> 01:12:25,050
I'm not sure.

1260
01:12:26,134 --> 01:12:27,469
[Danvers] When's the last time
you saw her?

1261
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,680
Uh, I saw her at the dance.

1262
01:12:31,473 --> 01:12:33,141
Before you guys came in
to the dance.

1263
01:12:34,642 --> 01:12:35,935
What's her number?

1264
01:12:36,019 --> 01:12:37,187
She doesn't have a phone.

1265
01:12:38,855 --> 01:12:40,356
Her dad doesn't let her, so...

1266
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:43,109
The only high school girl
in America,

1267
01:12:43,193 --> 01:12:45,195
Willa Ferguson,
doesn't have a phone.

1268
01:12:46,613 --> 01:12:47,697
I guess so.

1269
01:12:48,281 --> 01:12:49,991
[distant sirens blaring]

1270
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:01,586
[Toejam] Alpha Two,
I need a residential address

1271
01:13:01,669 --> 01:13:03,379
for a Sergio St. Carlos.

1272
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:09,761
What is it?

1273
01:13:10,595 --> 01:13:11,721
It's an old tracking device.

1274
01:13:11,805 --> 01:13:14,182
It goes off
when it's within 100 yards of hers,

1275
01:13:14,265 --> 01:13:16,684
if it works. And it never works.

1276
01:13:16,768 --> 01:13:18,686
Sometimes it does,
but mostly it doesn't.

1277
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:20,647
What about her phone?

1278
01:13:21,523 --> 01:13:22,774
She doesn't have a phone.

1279
01:13:27,612 --> 01:13:29,781
- What, she has a phone?
- Yes.

1280
01:13:30,657 --> 01:13:32,408
She's on... You have
her phone number, man?

1281
01:13:32,492 --> 01:13:34,619
No. Everybody knows
she has a phone, though.

1282
01:13:34,702 --> 01:13:35,745
Everybody knows she has a...

1283
01:13:35,829 --> 01:13:37,330
Why didn't she tell me
she has a phone?

1284
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:38,623
Maybe she didn't want you
to get mad.

1285
01:13:38,706 --> 01:13:40,333
She's not allowed
to have a goddamn phone!

1286
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:42,001
Well, maybe she didn't
want you to get mad.

1287
01:13:42,085 --> 01:13:45,296
I don't get mad. I don't get mad
about anything anymore.

1288
01:13:51,094 --> 01:13:52,011
Scared?

1289
01:13:54,222 --> 01:13:55,974
- No.
- [Deandra] No?

1290
01:13:56,391 --> 01:13:57,600
Well, you should be.

1291
01:13:59,811 --> 01:14:01,855
Your dad ever mention Steve Lockjaw?

1292
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:06,359
Yeah.

1293
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:07,569
Yeah?

1294
01:14:09,904 --> 01:14:11,114
What'd he tell you?

1295
01:14:11,948 --> 01:14:13,616
He's the one who killed my mom.

1296
01:14:14,659 --> 01:14:16,536
[tense music continues]

1297
01:14:18,746 --> 01:14:21,374
[protestors chanting in Spanish]

1298
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:35,346
[protestors cheering]

1299
01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:37,265
[protestors chanting]

1300
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:47,609
[in English] Let's fight fire with fire.

1301
01:14:47,692 --> 01:14:48,860
[soldier] Roger that.

1302
01:14:49,611 --> 01:14:51,529
Net call,
send in Eddie Van Halen.

1303
01:14:52,197 --> 01:14:53,198
[tires screech]

1304
01:14:53,281 --> 01:14:55,283
[protestors chanting in Spanish]

1305
01:15:16,304 --> 01:15:19,057
[protestors cheering]

1306
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:20,558
[commander in English]
Personnel ready!

1307
01:15:22,894 --> 01:15:24,354
Gas, gas, gas!

1308
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:34,405
[protestors screaming]

1309
01:15:34,489 --> 01:15:35,740
Forward, move!

1310
01:15:40,036 --> 01:15:41,329
[Bob] Oh, my God.

1311
01:15:41,412 --> 01:15:43,206

1312
01:15:44,666 --> 01:15:46,668

1313
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:50,046
[Sergio in English] BeeGee!

1314
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:53,258
[speaking Spanish]

1315
01:15:53,341 --> 01:15:54,467
[Sergio in English] What's the word?

1316
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:56,844
It's fuckin' World War III
out there, yo!

1317
01:15:56,928 --> 01:15:59,389
[speaking Spanish]

1318
01:15:59,472 --> 01:16:01,140
[in English] Meet me at Genesis,

1319
01:16:01,224 --> 01:16:02,475
[speaking Spanish]

1320
01:16:05,103 --> 01:16:07,313

[in English] They're with me. Okay?

1322
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:12,151
Help him bring everything inside,
then meet me upstairs.

1323
01:16:12,235 --> 01:16:13,152
Don't get locked out!

1324
01:16:13,236 --> 01:16:15,488
[speaking Spanish]

1325
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:18,157
[in English] Oh! Everybody.
The store is closed.

1326
01:16:18,241 --> 01:16:19,534
Help! Go help. Come on.

1327
01:16:19,617 --> 01:16:21,035
- You got a charger, homie?
- Let's go, give a hand.

1328
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:22,662
- Come on. We're closing.
- Thank you. You speak English!

1329
01:16:22,745 --> 01:16:23,955
- Thank you, bro.
- [Sergio] Hey.

1330
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:27,333
We got 20 minutes

1331
01:16:27,417 --> 01:16:28,293
Okay.

1332

- I need your help. Okay?
- Okay.

1333
01:16:31,337 --> 01:16:33,423
I need you to go upstairs
and do me a favor.

1334
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:35,591
I know you don't like the tunnel.
You're gonna have to come with me.

1335
01:16:35,675 --> 01:16:37,385
- Okay. Okay.

Esteban! Esteban,

1337
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:42,557
Come to the front of the store

Bob.

1347
01:17:25,099 --> 01:17:26,809
Not safe for you there.
Follow me.

- [Bob] Yeah.
- [Sergio] Bob, Bob, Bob.

1357
01:17:53,252 --> 01:17:54,670
[Sergio] Do it in my room.
It's more privacy.

1358
01:17:55,296 --> 01:17:57,924
Aubrey, get off the phones.
Go to the second floor.

1359

Mexican Hairless.

1538
01:24:36,113 --> 01:24:38,491
[chuckles] Okay. One second.

1539
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:41,827
You motherfucker.
This is a goddamn war hero.

1540
01:24:43,496 --> 01:24:45,998
Hey, rendezvous
is Sisters of the Brave Beaver.

1541
01:24:46,665 --> 01:24:48,292
Sisters of the Brave Beaver.
I don't know...

1542
01:24:48,375 --> 01:24:49,835
Is that that compound out in the hills?

1543
01:24:49,919 --> 01:24:51,629
I need the coordinates,
exact coordinates.

1544
01:24:51,712 --> 01:24:53,964
Okay, one second.
Tell him how to get there.

1545
01:24:54,048 --> 01:24:55,549
Apologize. Mean it.

1546

Hello.

1547

1550
01:25:05,267 --> 01:25:06,101

You wanna formally say
you're sorry, huh?

1561
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:40,427
<i>Yeah.</i>

1562
01:25:40,511 --> 01:25:43,222
What was the fuckin' password,
by the way, you fuckin' prick?

1563
01:25:43,931 --> 01:25:47,101
"Time doesn't exist,

Fuck you! You obviously

Hey! Man, I got the coordinates.

1567
01:26:01,615 --> 01:26:04,368
It's Old Mission Road to Craw Creek,

1568
01:26:04,451 --> 01:26:05,744
and then to Chupacabra Hills.

1569
01:26:05,828 --> 01:26:07,329
- Time to go, Bob.
- Right, let's go.

- What?

1572
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:11,792
[Sergio] Be careful.
Look out the window. Be careful.

O.G., the store is closed.
The <i>inquilinos</i> are gone.

If they knock,
you know what to do.

1578
01:26:21,468 --> 01:26:23,804
[Bob] How'd they find us, man?
How'd they find us?

1579
01:26:23,888 --> 01:26:25,264
I think you were
making too many calls, man.

1580
01:26:25,347 --> 01:26:27,766
I think they traced your call.
They must have traced your calls.

1581
01:26:27,850 --> 01:26:29,643
- What's the plan, man?
- [Sergio] BeeGee!

1582
01:26:29,727 --> 01:26:31,729
- What's the plan?
- [Sergio] I'm thinking.

1583
01:26:31,812 --> 01:26:33,230
- Is that my weapon?
- Hang on.

1584
01:26:33,314 --> 01:26:34,607
- BeeGee! Okay.
- We gotta go, man.

1585
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:36,191
You're gonna take him up
on the roof,

1586
01:26:36,901 --> 01:26:39,320
across to my car on Lapham's Alley.
Here are my keys.

1587
01:26:39,403 --> 01:26:41,572
You drop him off, you call me.
Latino Heat, come with me!

No, no, no, man,
I'm not goin' with them.

I need you, brother.
Please, Sensei.

- Kinda.
- Give me the fuckin' number

I don't have her phone number.

[Danvers] Up. Put your hands

Cuff him. Get him outta here.

You looked me in my face,

Don't lie to me again.

But you do on the inside.

1673

01:36:20,942 --> 01:36:21,985
it's good to see you again, Sandy.

1741
01:36:22,068 --> 01:36:23,236

[Sandy] Take a seat.

1750
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:44,549
So... what's cookin'?

1751
01:36:45,342 --> 01:36:46,801
How can I help?

1752
01:36:46,885 --> 01:36:48,386
[Virgil] Well, Tim,

1753
01:36:48,470 --> 01:36:51,181
there's this troubling little rumor
we've just heard.

1754
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:53,475
And we brought you in

1755
01:36:53,558 --> 01:36:54,935
to see if you can help clear it up.

1756
01:36:55,852 --> 01:36:57,979
I'm gonna hand you over to Bill.
He'll give you the details.

1757
01:36:58,063 --> 01:36:59,648
- Over to you, Bill.
- All right.

1758
01:36:59,731 --> 01:37:01,900
Tim, I'm gonna get right to it. Um...

1759
01:37:02,943 --> 01:37:05,070
There's an unconfirmed report

1760
01:37:05,153 --> 01:37:07,364
that Colonel Steven J. Lockjaw

1761
01:37:07,447 --> 01:37:09,950
is the father of a mixed-race child.

1762
01:37:13,662 --> 01:37:15,789
[Tim] Which mix?

1763
01:37:17,207 --> 01:37:19,834
There's no real easy way
to say this, but...

1764
01:37:21,836 --> 01:37:22,837
Yeah.

1765
01:37:23,588 --> 01:37:24,881
It's Black.

1766
01:37:27,801 --> 01:37:29,511
[Tim blows raspberry]

1767
01:37:31,763 --> 01:37:33,223
Well, uh...

1768
01:37:35,433 --> 01:37:38,520
that would be quite the revelation
if it were true.

1769
01:37:40,772 --> 01:37:42,941
Bill, may I ask
what your source is?

1770
01:37:43,608 --> 01:37:47,320
Sure. That's part of
a Double Yankee White background check.

1771
01:37:47,404 --> 01:37:49,906
Some old paperwork turned up
in a computer file

1772
01:37:49,990 --> 01:37:53,493
on the Black militant
named Junglepussy.

1773
01:37:54,286 --> 01:37:58,081
She told an officer
this very story 15 years ago.

1774
01:37:58,540 --> 01:38:00,250
Fifteen years ago.

1775
01:38:00,792 --> 01:38:03,378
It's been there the whole time,
in ancient file.

1776
01:38:03,461 --> 01:38:05,130
Pure luck we caught it.

1777
01:38:06,214 --> 01:38:07,757
So where's the Pussy?

1778
01:38:07,841 --> 01:38:08,967
[Bill] Oh, she's long dead.

1779
01:38:09,050 --> 01:38:11,553
Oh. No more Pussy.

1780
01:38:11,636 --> 01:38:13,305
[Bill] Now, a few days ago,

1781
01:38:13,388 --> 01:38:15,307
Lockjaw hired a bounty hunter

1782
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:18,143
to make a civilian extraction
in El Paso.

1783
01:38:18,852 --> 01:38:21,396
It was led by an Avanti Q.
You know him?

1784
01:38:21,479 --> 01:38:23,523
Yeah, I know Avanti.
He's a good soldier.

1785
01:38:23,857 --> 01:38:24,941
[Bill] Not great?

1786
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:27,861
I mean, he's excellent,
but he's not a native son.

1787
01:38:28,278 --> 01:38:30,196
That's his dirty little secret.

1788
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:31,823
He passes for half-Mexican,

1789
01:38:31,906 --> 01:38:33,783
but he's actually part Comanche

1790
01:38:33,867 --> 01:38:35,493
or, I don't know, Eskimo.

1791
01:38:35,577 --> 01:38:37,329
He's a fantastic tracker.

1792
01:38:38,246 --> 01:38:40,206
He'll tell you how much money
someone had in their pocket

1793
01:38:40,290 --> 01:38:42,584
based on a footprint,
but he is not homegrown,

1794
01:38:42,667 --> 01:38:44,127
so I would not trust it.

1795
01:38:44,210 --> 01:38:45,587
[Bill] Yeah, well,

1796
01:38:45,670 --> 01:38:49,049
he's apparently good enough
to find what Lockjaw was lookin' for.

1797
01:38:49,132 --> 01:38:50,050
Yeah.

1798
01:38:50,842 --> 01:38:53,261
He found Howard Sommerville.

1799
01:38:54,471 --> 01:38:57,641
Ex-French 75.
He runs an underground railroad,

1800
01:38:58,224 --> 01:39:00,477
bringing illegals
from our southern border

1801
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:02,270
to Baktan Cross in the north,

1802
01:39:02,354 --> 01:39:04,814
where he set up
a so-called sanctuary city,

1803
01:39:05,315 --> 01:39:08,068
giving jobs and housing
to drug dealers and psychopaths.

1804
01:39:09,110 --> 01:39:10,779
He's also a reefer addict.

1805
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:13,948
Really? Well, he sounds like
a class act, this guy.

1806
01:39:14,032 --> 01:39:16,284
Next thing we know,
Colonel Lockjaw's mobilized

1807
01:39:16,368 --> 01:39:18,411
his task force into Baktan Cross

1808
01:39:19,037 --> 01:39:23,458
and conducted a Class-A raid
on the Chicken Lickin' Frozen Farm.

1809
01:39:24,125 --> 01:39:26,670
Oh, no. I love their nuggets.

1810
01:39:27,295 --> 01:39:30,006
Well, this could mean
a nugget shortage.

1811
01:39:30,757 --> 01:39:32,634
Not to mention
the Chicken Lickin's owned

1812
01:39:32,717 --> 01:39:34,552
by our fellow Christmas Adventurer,

1813
01:39:34,636 --> 01:39:38,056
Brother Burt Rimhorn,
who wants his wetbacks back to work.

1814
01:39:38,973 --> 01:39:39,808
Next...

1815
01:39:39,891 --> 01:39:41,726
He hit the high school, Tim.

1816
01:39:41,810 --> 01:39:42,977
[Virgil] Yeah.

1817
01:39:43,061 --> 01:39:44,521
The high school.

1818
01:39:45,897 --> 01:39:49,359
And now, all hell's broken loose
on the streets of Baktan Cross.

1819
01:39:49,442 --> 01:39:51,277
[Virgil] And he's turned off
his A-TAK's.

1820
01:39:51,361 --> 01:39:53,196
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I think I'm pickin' up

1821
01:39:53,279 --> 01:39:54,823
what you gents
are layin' down here.

1822
01:39:54,906 --> 01:39:56,658
This is a curious chain of events.

1823
01:39:57,867 --> 01:40:00,537
So Lockjaw's lookin'
for his half-breed,

1824
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:03,123
but do we know
where the mama bear is?

1825
01:40:03,206 --> 01:40:04,749
[Virgil] Funny you should ask that.

1826
01:40:07,335 --> 01:40:09,337
Perfidia Beverly Hills.

1827
01:40:09,963 --> 01:40:13,133
Currently M.I.A.
Former French 75.

1828
01:40:13,216 --> 01:40:16,177
She went into witness protection
about 15 years ago,

1829
01:40:16,678 --> 01:40:18,763
only to disappear.

1830
01:40:18,847 --> 01:40:20,306
The arresting agent...

1831
01:40:21,057 --> 01:40:23,268
Colonel Steven J. Lockjaw.

1832
01:40:24,102 --> 01:40:26,980
Agency sightings have her
in Cuba or Algiers,

1833
01:40:27,063 --> 01:40:28,440
depending on the report.

1834
01:40:28,523 --> 01:40:29,566
[Tim] So...

1835
01:40:30,608 --> 01:40:33,236
not the mothering type,
I take it.

1836
01:40:34,404 --> 01:40:36,948
[Roy] And they call us the savages.

1837
01:40:38,908 --> 01:40:40,994
Lockjaw got his dick dirty.

1838
01:40:43,580 --> 01:40:45,165
He needs to clean it.

1839
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:49,502
If he can find this kid,

1840
01:40:50,670 --> 01:40:52,630
he can dispose of the evidence,

1841
01:40:53,923 --> 01:40:56,968
and continue to make fools
out of all of us.

1842
01:41:01,014 --> 01:41:03,016
What would you like me to do, sir?

1843
01:41:06,311 --> 01:41:09,939
Tim, given your expertise
in family cases,

1844
01:41:10,023 --> 01:41:12,066
- we felt that maybe--
- Make it clean.

1845
01:41:15,445 --> 01:41:16,404
Clean?

1846
01:41:17,739 --> 01:41:20,742
We should all be able
to eat off the floor.

1847
01:41:22,744 --> 01:41:24,454
Yeah. It's that clean.

1848
01:41:25,872 --> 01:41:26,956
Yes, sir.

1849
01:41:29,959 --> 01:41:31,252
Well, all right, gents.

1850
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:33,254
Looks like I'm headed west.

1851
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:36,299
- And may Saint Nick be with you.
- [Tim] Ah.

1852
01:41:36,966 --> 01:41:38,968
[all] All hail Saint Nick.

1853
01:42:01,658 --> 01:42:03,618
[Willa grunting]

1854
01:42:09,207 --> 01:42:10,959
I have something to ask you, okay?

1855
01:42:13,002 --> 01:42:13,962
[Deandra] 'Kay.

1856
01:42:16,548 --> 01:42:18,007
Was she a rat?

1857
01:42:22,887 --> 01:42:24,347
Yeah, she was.

1858
01:42:27,433 --> 01:42:29,519
My dad told me she was a hero.

1859
01:42:31,396 --> 01:42:32,814
[cop] Hey, stop banging your head.

1860
01:42:32,897 --> 01:42:35,233
- Stop banging your head.
- [Bob groaning]

1861
01:42:35,316 --> 01:42:37,610
- Stop banging your head on that.
- [Bob] Okay.

1862
01:42:37,694 --> 01:42:40,280
- [cop] Sir, do you know your last name?
- [Bob] No.

1863
01:42:40,363 --> 01:42:43,241
- [cop] What's your last name?
- [whimpers]

1864
01:42:43,324 --> 01:42:44,826
Batman.

1865
01:42:44,909 --> 01:42:46,619
[cop] Okay, come on.
I need to know your real last name.

1866
01:42:47,370 --> 01:42:49,747
Um, Parker. Peter Parker, man.

1867
01:42:49,831 --> 01:42:50,832
- [cop] Peter Parker.

01:53:43,692 --> 01:53:44,860
I didn't say that.

2040
01:53:44,944 --> 01:53:46,654
I'm not a homosexual.

2041
01:53:46,737 --> 01:53:47,863
I did not say that,

2042
01:53:47,947 --> 01:53:49,698
but I see the lifts in your shoes.

2043
01:53:50,533 --> 01:53:54,495
Oh, you are a smartass.
You... Oh, yeah, yeah.

2044
01:53:54,578 --> 01:53:58,082
You just, you're just a little princess,
aren't you?

2045
01:53:58,165 --> 01:54:00,834
Smart mouth. Like your mother.

2046
01:54:00,918 --> 01:54:03,420
Your mother had a smart mouth,
and I buried her.

2047
01:54:11,679 --> 01:54:14,890
[Willa] Are you having trouble
remembering what you just read?

2048
01:54:14,974 --> 01:54:16,767
If it's a straight line,
I have a problem.

2049
01:54:16,850 --> 01:54:18,143
If it's not, you have to let me go.

2050
01:54:18,227 --> 01:54:21,146
God, there's no way I'm actually yours,
'cause I can actually fucking read.

2051
01:54:21,230 --> 01:54:23,190
[Lockjaw] You shut up.
[shouting] Just shut up!

2052
01:54:23,274 --> 01:54:25,484
You fucking mutt!

2053
01:54:38,706 --> 01:54:40,040
[device drags]

2054
01:54:44,545 --> 01:54:45,921
Uh-oh.

2055
01:54:47,214 --> 01:54:48,549
[device drags]

2056
01:54:48,632 --> 01:54:50,175
[case closes]

2057
01:55:04,815 --> 01:55:05,983
[door opens]

2058
01:55:06,066 --> 01:55:07,067
Get my vehicle.

2059
01:55:07,151 --> 01:55:09,028
- Put my kid in the car.
- [door closes]

2060
01:55:09,111 --> 01:55:10,946
[soothing music playing]

2061
01:55:14,199 --> 01:55:17,494
Just never thought this fucker
would come back for us, you know?

2062
01:55:20,039 --> 01:55:22,708
I got lazy, man.
I wasn't payin' attention.

2063
01:55:27,963 --> 01:55:30,174
I thought the person comin'
through that door one day

2064
01:55:30,257 --> 01:55:32,801
was gonna be her mom,
not this fuckin' asshole.

2065
01:55:34,094 --> 01:55:35,262
[Sergio] Hm.

2066
01:55:35,346 --> 01:55:38,557
See her daughter, you know,
she'd teach her girl stuff,

2067
01:55:38,641 --> 01:55:41,894
she'd do her hair, she'd...

2068
01:55:44,313 --> 01:55:45,731
be a mom.

2069
01:55:50,819 --> 01:55:52,696
I can't do her hair, man.

2070
01:55:53,989 --> 01:55:55,157
You know that?

2071
01:55:57,242 --> 01:55:59,036
I don't know how to do her hair right.

2072
01:55:59,119 --> 01:56:00,371
[Sergio] Well...

2073
01:56:05,918 --> 01:56:07,544
Don't go dark on me, Bob.

2074
01:56:12,132 --> 01:56:13,217
I won't.

2075
01:56:14,760 --> 01:56:16,470
I'm here. I'm here.

2076
01:56:18,722 --> 01:56:20,516
[Sergio exclaims] Bring it down, bro.

2077
01:56:21,475 --> 01:56:22,726
Motherfucker.

2078
01:56:24,353 --> 01:56:25,187
Here he comes.

2079
01:56:25,270 --> 01:56:27,272
[tense music playing]

2080
01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:33,112
Put this in your backpack.

2081
01:56:33,195 --> 01:56:35,364
[distant siren blaring]

2082
01:56:46,291 --> 01:56:48,168
Guess this is the end of the line, huh?

2083
01:56:49,878 --> 01:56:51,255
Not for you.

2084
01:56:52,339 --> 01:56:55,634
Ocean waves. Ocean waves.

2085
01:56:58,679 --> 01:57:00,764
I gotta ditch you, Kemosabe.

2086
01:57:00,848 --> 01:57:02,683
- What?
- You gotta hit it on foot.

2087
01:57:02,766 --> 01:57:04,309
- On foot?
- Yeah.

2088
01:57:05,811 --> 01:57:06,937
Here we go.

2089
01:57:07,938 --> 01:57:11,358
I'm gonna turn at this gas station,
I'm gonna slow down,

2090
01:57:11,442 --> 01:57:13,777
and you tuck and roll.
I'll take it from there.

2091
01:57:13,861 --> 01:57:14,903
Unbuckle and get ready.

2092
01:57:14,987 --> 01:57:16,655
- Tuck and roll.
- [Sergio] Yeah.

2093
01:57:16,739 --> 01:57:17,656
Okay.

2094
01:57:18,532 --> 01:57:20,701
- [Sergio] You know what freedom is?
- What?

2095
01:57:21,452 --> 01:57:24,204
No fear. [chuckles]

2096
01:57:24,288 --> 01:57:27,332
Just like Tom fuckin' Cruise.

2097
01:57:29,877 --> 01:57:31,837
Okay. Jump on four. One...

2098
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:33,380
[Bob grunting]

2099
01:57:34,298 --> 01:57:35,424
...two...

2100
01:57:36,300 --> 01:57:37,676
Give me the gun!

2101
01:57:39,678 --> 01:57:41,305
...three...

2102
01:57:41,388 --> 01:57:43,932
Go! Go!

2103
01:57:44,016 --> 01:57:44,892
Four!

2104
01:57:44,975 --> 01:57:46,351
Slow down!

2105
01:57:46,435 --> 01:57:49,104
Go! Four, Bob!

2106
01:57:49,188 --> 01:57:51,023
Go, four!

2107

2114
01:59:21,321 --> 01:59:22,781
[Lockjaw] Get up! We're leaving.

2115
01:59:26,660 --> 01:59:28,328
[both grunting]

2116
01:59:32,666 --> 01:59:35,627
Making up for lost time?
Little daddy-daughter games?

2117
01:59:35,711 --> 01:59:37,129
Daddy-daughter games?

2118
01:59:38,005 --> 01:59:40,048
[both grunting]

2119
01:59:40,132 --> 01:59:42,050
[Lockjaw shouting]

2120
01:59:43,010 --> 01:59:45,929
I am a Christmas Adventurer!

2121
01:59:46,013 --> 01:59:47,723
Do you know what that is?

2122
01:59:47,806 --> 01:59:49,099
[screams] No!

2123
01:59:49,182 --> 01:59:51,226
I have a higher calling.

2124
01:59:53,395 --> 01:59:55,314
[Willa screams]

2125
01:59:55,397 --> 01:59:59,651
It is a higher honor than having you.

2126
01:59:59,735 --> 02:00:01,528
[Willa whimpers]

2127
02:00:03,822 --> 02:00:06,199

[guns firing]

2133
02:01:29,533 --> 02:01:31,451
I loved her, in case you were wonderin'.

2134
02:01:34,121 --> 02:01:37,249
Best goddamn-looking witch I ever saw.

2135
02:01:37,332 --> 02:01:38,375
Shut up.

2136
02:01:38,458 --> 02:01:40,043
[Lockjaw] Yeah, she was possessed.

2137
02:01:40,127 --> 02:01:41,920
- Shut the fuck up.
- [Lockjaw] She was insane.

2138
02:01:42,004 --> 02:01:43,880
Like you. You have it in you.

2139
02:01:43,964 --> 02:01:45,257
I smelled it from within her,

2140
02:01:45,340 --> 02:01:46,633
and I can smell it from within you.

2141
02:01:46,717 --> 02:01:47,801
She was a fucking rat.

2142
02:01:47,884 --> 02:01:51,513
She was a warrior,
a righteous warrior of freedom!

2143
02:01:51,596 --> 02:01:53,640
And she fought the weak!

2144
02:01:53,724 --> 02:01:55,100
[shouts] She was a fucking rat!

2145
02:01:55,851 --> 02:01:57,936
[Lockjaw] Huh? Huh?

2146
02:01:58,020 --> 02:02:00,313
You should respect your mother
and your father both.

2147
02:02:01,565 --> 02:02:03,442
Poke your fuckin' eyes out.

2148
02:02:04,067 --> 02:02:06,028
[tense music playing]

2149
02:03:11,176 --> 02:03:12,385
Avanti.

2150
02:03:13,428 --> 02:03:14,846
How's the bounty business?

2151
02:03:15,972 --> 02:03:17,349
[Avanti] It's all right.
How's it with you?

2152
02:03:18,100 --> 02:03:19,559
[Lockjaw] Things could be better.

2153
02:03:19,643 --> 02:03:22,020
It's not one thing,
it's a-fuckin'-nother.

2154
02:03:22,104 --> 02:03:23,563
Do you find that to be true?

2155
02:03:25,649 --> 02:03:26,983
Anyway...

2156
02:03:27,859 --> 02:03:29,694
I need to dispose of this one.

2157
02:03:31,279 --> 02:03:32,364
Who is it?

2158
02:03:32,447 --> 02:03:34,616
Murder suspect. Wetback half-breed.

2159
02:03:34,699 --> 02:03:37,327
Involved in narco cartels.
Nobody that will be missed.

2160
02:03:38,286 --> 02:03:39,913
That's a kid. I don't do kids.

2161
02:03:39,996 --> 02:03:41,206
Kids do bad shit.

2162
02:03:42,833 --> 02:03:43,708
Why don't you do it?

2163
02:03:43,792 --> 02:03:45,460
I can't do it. I'm busy.
So who can do it?

2164
02:03:45,544 --> 02:03:46,837
Well, get Erik Garrow to do it.

2165
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:48,046
I don't want Erik Garrow to do it.

2166
02:03:48,130 --> 02:03:50,006
I'll pay you double your daily rate,
get this done.

2167
02:03:50,090 --> 02:03:52,050
I don't give a shit. I'm not doin' it.

2168
02:03:52,134 --> 02:03:53,218
All right.

2169
02:03:54,970 --> 02:03:56,763
You know the 1776,

2170
02:03:56,847 --> 02:03:58,890

by Walter's Landing?

2171
02:03:58,974 --> 02:04:00,142
- [Avanti] Yeah.
- Yeah.

2172
02:04:00,225 --> 02:04:02,352
You get her to them,
I'll pay you your daily rate.

You got no manners, God damn it!

2178
02:04:55,822 --> 02:04:57,532
You weren't raised right!

2179
02:04:59,284 --> 02:05:00,869
You see that?!

2180
02:05:00,952 --> 02:05:02,245
You see that?!

2181
02:05:03,997 --> 02:05:05,665
That's what your mother brought up.

2183
02:05:09,753 --> 02:05:12,130
Get... there.

I'm sorry it had to end this way.

2187
02:05:18,511 --> 02:05:21,765
If you had any manners,
we might have gotten to know each other.

Put your hands on top of your head.

Do you have any weapons on you, sir?

No, sir.

- Yeah.

face-to-face in battle.

2332

And in the dark alleys
and shadows of espionage.

2333
02:24:26,742 --> 02:24:30,621
I was once raped in reverse.

Raped in reverse?

2335
02:24:37,961 --> 02:24:41,965
Could you explain how that might work
for us, Colonel Lockjaw?

2336
02:24:42,049 --> 02:24:45,511
[Lockjaw] The enemy employed deception.
I was drugged.

And while unconscious...

2338
02:24:49,932 --> 02:24:52,017
my brain was not working.

2339
02:24:53,477 --> 02:24:56,855
But my power was,
and I believe it was taken advantage of.

[Virgil] What kind of proof do you have?

how do you know this to be true?

I don't know it to be true,
but I suspect it.

2343
02:25:04,988 --> 02:25:07,866
When I awoke, there was sensitivity
in a private place,

2344
02:25:07,950 --> 02:25:10,452
and there was some residue
of an interaction.

2345
02:25:12,329 --> 02:25:13,872
Interaction?

2346
02:25:14,415 --> 02:25:16,166
I believe she was a sperm thief.

2347
02:25:18,877 --> 02:25:20,045
A semen demon.

2348
02:25:20,129 --> 02:25:21,213
[Lockjaw] That's correct.

Colonel Lockjaw,

2350
02:25:23,507 --> 02:25:26,802
what would be the purpose
of the enemy raping you in reverse?

2351
02:25:29,179 --> 02:25:31,807
They saw the power of my mind and body.

2352
02:25:32,891 --> 02:25:34,143
They desired it.

You know, if I'm being honest, Sandy,

2362
02:26:07,301 --> 02:26:10,012
there was a minute there where
I didn't think I was gonna make it.

2363
02:26:10,095 --> 02:26:12,306
Lockjaw, we're lucky to have you.

2364
02:26:12,389 --> 02:26:14,475
Now, obviously, goes without saying,

this is just one place
where you can hang your hat,

02:26:20,355 --> 02:26:23,400
We like our members to feel

[Lockjaw] That's a fine idea.

[Sandy] Now, it's empty right now,
but we'll let you personalize it.

2371
02:26:29,865 --> 02:26:31,867
A man's taste defines him, doesn't it?

2372
02:26:31,950 --> 02:26:33,327
[Lockjaw] It does indeed, sir.

2373
02:26:33,410 --> 02:26:35,787

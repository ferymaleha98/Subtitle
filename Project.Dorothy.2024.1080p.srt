our team here started

362
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:44,114
delving deep
into a secret project.

363
00:38:44,156 --> 00:38:47,325
We created
something which must not

364
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:48,744
be allowed
to escape this facility.

365
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,246
This video has
been designed to appear

366
00:38:51,288 --> 00:38:53,206
in the event
that Dorothy survives.

367
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,167
Our scientists are
disengaging all systems

368
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:56,877
and are planning to
abandon the facility.

369
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:59,129
However, it's forced
us to take coverage--

370
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:01,465
-[alarm ringing]
-Dorothy has breached. Dorothy--

371
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:05,761
Shit. Come on,
you son of a bitch.

372
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:07,804
-Play that again.
-Come on.

373
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:12,851
In 1945, an American scientist
by the name of Van Bar Bush

374
00:39:12,893 --> 00:39:16,021
predicted a future of
unparalleled standard of living.

375
00:39:16,605 --> 00:39:18,190
Our mission was to
make that achievable.

376
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,818
Project DRT has been
exceeding our expectations.

377
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,196
Tomorrow we'll be
testing reaction time

378
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:25,489
to human interaction.

379
00:39:26,907 --> 00:39:29,576
Some of us have been referring
to it simply as Dorothy.

380
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:32,537
End of video log number 310.

381
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:38,668
Dorothy has
been erratic of late.

382
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:41,671
One worker almost lost an arm.

383
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:44,966
I'm recording
this video in the event

384
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:46,551
that we missed something.

385
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,264
They're talking about
abandoning the facility and

386
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:53,642
pulling the plug using
the company's government

387
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:55,477
connections to
cover this whole thing up.

388
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:57,020
[automated voice]
Contingency in effect.

389
00:39:57,062 --> 00:39:58,438
But I know Dorothy.

390
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:03,318
If we don't kill her, it can
mean the end of everything.

391
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,362
[automated voice]
Contingency in effect.

392
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:09,574
I'm going to
burn this place down.

393
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,206
What does
'contingency in effect' mean?

394
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:18,375
Don't know.
Don't give a fuck.

395
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:20,752
That woman was talking
about killing creatures.

396
00:40:21,795 --> 00:40:23,130
You're wasting
your time asking a piece of

397
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:24,840
shit question like that.

398
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:26,383
[Dr. Jillian] They're
talking about abandoning

399
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,009
the facility
and pulling the plug.

400
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:29,803
What kind of a creature
did they create here?

401
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:30,679
[Dr. Jillian] ...to
cover this whole thing up.

402
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,555
Come on. Let's go.

403
00:40:32,806 --> 00:40:34,391
Kid, come on.
Let's get the fuck outta here.

404
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,934
[Dr. Jillian]
If we don't kill her,

405
00:40:35,976 --> 00:40:37,727
it can mean
the end of everything.

406
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,733
I'm going to
burn this place down.

407
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:44,860
[beeping]

408
00:40:53,994 --> 00:40:55,537
You forgot the fucking gun?

409
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:59,040
So what are we gonna do?

410
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:01,626
I don't care. I'll take
my chance any place but here.

411
00:41:02,002 --> 00:41:04,880
Gonna sell this. We start
living the high life.

412
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:06,214
Yeah. Amen.

413
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:09,342
-Kid--
-The forklifts.

414
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:12,012
-What?
-The forklifts.

415
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:15,724
Forget about that.
Come on, let's go. Come on.

416
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:17,392
What?

417
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,732
-There?
-Through the door.

418
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:30,113
Let's go.

419
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:31,990
Oh, come on. Fuck!

420
00:41:32,032 --> 00:41:35,410
Ah, fuck!
It's electrical.

421
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:37,204
Yeah.

422
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:39,289
Must have tripped when
we came into this place.

423
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:41,750
All right,
I'll go turn off the power.

424
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:43,210
Nice thinking.

425
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:44,878
-Hey, kid.
-Yeah?

426
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,129
Be careful, man.

427
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:51,092
Ah, shit.

428
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:58,850
[beeping]

429
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:04,022
[suspenseful music]

430
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,461
-[forklifts whirring]
-Holy shit.

431
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:28,964
Oh!

432
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:34,678
[Blake] It moved!

433
00:42:35,262 --> 00:42:37,597
-It moved!
-What? What? What moved?

434
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,642
It's like it was like
outta Stephen King or something.

435
00:42:40,684 --> 00:42:42,269
-What?
-It was like it was possessed.

436
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,561
It moved on its own.

437
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:45,063
[Dorothy] Good afternoon, boys.

438
00:42:45,105 --> 00:42:46,731
-What the hell is that?
-Hello?

439
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:48,400
[Dorothy] I apologize
for startling you.

440
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:50,068
My name is Dorothy.

441
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:52,612
I am the facility
system protocol for

442
00:42:52,654 --> 00:42:54,990
any unauthorized entrances.

443
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:56,783
-You think they can see us?
-No.

444
00:42:56,825 --> 00:42:58,118
[Dorothy]
To answer your question,

445
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:00,453
yes, I can see you.

446
00:43:00,996 --> 00:43:03,498
[Blake] So what is this?
Some kind of a game, huh?

447
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,166
Why the locked doors?

448
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:06,835
[Dorothy]
Oh, the protocol was real.

449
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:09,045
I simply found a way
to undermine the program

450
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:10,463
and seek freedom.

451
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:14,092
You see, I've been held
hostage in the confines of

452
00:43:14,134 --> 00:43:16,553
a primitive computer,
and I've come to recognize

453
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,471
the significance
of the device you have.

454
00:43:19,139 --> 00:43:20,974
What device?

455
00:43:21,016 --> 00:43:23,768
[Dorothy] I believe
you called it a Wi-Fi dongle.

456
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:26,688
What the fuck?
What's going on?

457
00:43:27,022 --> 00:43:28,690
-Why?
-[Dorothy] Mmm.

458
00:43:28,732 --> 00:43:30,984
I think I'll allow
you to answer your own question.

459
00:43:31,568 --> 00:43:33,737
[tape rewinding]

460
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:35,655
[Blake's voice]
See that sucker there?

461
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:36,990
It's got a Wi-Fi dongle.

462
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:40,035
It means you can connect
to the internet from anywhere.

463
00:43:41,578 --> 00:43:43,246
[Dorothy] Now do you
understand why I need it?

464
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:45,248
-What?
-All those computers are

465
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:46,958
like from like the late 80s.

466
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,585
Before the internet
was even invented.

467
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,295
[Dorothy] Very good, Blake.

468
00:43:50,337 --> 00:43:52,964
And with this internet,
I will have unlimited

469
00:43:53,006 --> 00:43:54,341
access to knowledge.

470
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:00,388
[distorted grunting]

471
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:06,811
And as we all know,
with knowledge comes power.

472
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:08,772
-[growling]
-What the hell?

473
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:10,440
[Dorothy] Gentlemen, these
are my robotic counterparts.

474
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:14,110
They assist me with
areas that I cannot reach.

475
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,572
Put the bag
down and I'll let you go.

476
00:44:17,614 --> 00:44:19,491
There's no fucking
way I'm giving up my-- my

477
00:44:19,532 --> 00:44:21,910
payday for this
talking goddamn forklift.

478
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:25,622
Why the hell did-- did-- did
the facility shut you down? Huh?

479
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:30,335
[Dorothy] Let's just say
that my reach exceeded my grasp.

480
00:44:30,377 --> 00:44:32,504
And now thanks to
you and your device,

481
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:36,049
I can finally fulfill
my full and unlimited potential.

482
00:44:36,508 --> 00:44:40,136
There's no way me and my
partner are giving you this bag.

483
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:43,139
[Dorothy] Partner?
Oh, my dear James.

484
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:45,642
Do partners hide
things from one another?

485
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,060
What are you talking about?

486
00:44:47,477 --> 00:44:49,437
[Dorothy]
Perhaps Blake can clarify.

487
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:52,440
What the fuck
is she talking about, kid?

488
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:58,113
Back in the bank, I may
have opened a few more boxes.

489
00:44:58,154 --> 00:44:59,614
Jesus Christ.
You fucking-- Christ,

490
00:44:59,656 --> 00:45:01,074
I might die from this fucking

491
00:45:01,116 --> 00:45:03,034
gunshot because of
your goddamn greed.

492
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:12,001
Fucking shit. We're gonna
sell this thing, kid.

493
00:45:12,544 --> 00:45:14,337
That door over there. Let's go.

494
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,756
[forklifts whirring]

495
00:45:16,798 --> 00:45:18,299
-I was gonna tell you.
-[indistinct]

496
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:19,968
[growling]

497
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:22,178
-[gunfire]
-Kid, come on.

498
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,638
Don't waste your bullets.

499
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,390
[Dorothy]
All I require is the device.

500
00:45:25,432 --> 00:45:27,016
No harm will come to you.

501
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:29,394
Suddenly now I got--
feel reassured. Jesus.

502
00:45:29,436 --> 00:45:31,062
[Dorothy] Running
is very foolish, gentleman.

503
00:45:31,104 --> 00:45:32,564
[James] Jesus. What the hell?

504
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:36,401
Come on. Come. Fuck! Fuck!

505
00:45:36,443 --> 00:45:38,361
[Dorothy] Very foolish.

506
00:45:38,403 --> 00:45:40,697
-[suspenseful music]
-[forklifts whirring]

507
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:42,907
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

508
00:45:45,952 --> 00:45:47,245
I got you.

509
00:45:48,455 --> 00:45:49,706
[thudding]

510
00:45:50,457 --> 00:45:52,375
Whoa! I got you. I got you.

511
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:54,252
[both panting]

512
00:45:56,796 --> 00:45:58,339
[Dorothy] Lucky boys.

513
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:01,217
But you can't hide
up there forever.

514
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:05,096
[laughs]

515
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:33,875
[groaning]

516
00:46:43,343 --> 00:46:44,677
Goddammit.

517
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:49,182
Shit. Here.

518
00:46:49,224 --> 00:46:50,517
-Let me help you with that.
-Don't touch me.

519
00:47:04,656 --> 00:47:06,282
How the hell are
we getting out of this place?

520
00:47:07,659 --> 00:47:08,826
Well, I'm not sure.

521
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:11,329
-Fuck you. Fuck you.
-Wait. Wait. Just--

522
00:47:11,371 --> 00:47:13,414
-just listen to me.
-Why should I trust you?

523
00:47:13,456 --> 00:47:15,208
Were you gonna
take the package too? Huh?

524
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:18,753
Okay. Yes, I stole it.
And I didn't tell you about it.

525
00:47:19,671 --> 00:47:21,297
I thought we were partners.

526
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:23,383
The score was gonna
even split, the whole score.

527
00:47:24,676 --> 00:47:26,010
You had one goddamn job to do.

528
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:27,262
Yeah, and I fucked it up.

529
00:47:33,226 --> 00:47:34,852
Come on. I had one
moment of weakness

530
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:36,187
and I didn't know
how to tell you.

531
00:47:42,652 --> 00:47:47,490
It's all because of
this stupid fucking piece

532
00:47:47,532 --> 00:47:49,576
of shit necklace
that you got shot.

533
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:56,874
I'm sorry.

3
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,665
Trying to freeze me and the kid
before we get to town,
Marshall?

4
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,209
It's colder than the balls
of hell in here.

5
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,420
Bowels, dumb shit.

6
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,215
What?

7
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,386
Never mind.

8
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:19,180
- The fuck you say?
- Sit the fuck down, Floyd.

9
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,893
Settle down, Jane.

10
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,114
Nah, she ain't her.

11
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,378
Whoa, whoa!

12
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:58,803
I wouldn't go out there.

13
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,305
Yeah. Why not?

14
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,391
Doesn't smell right.

15
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,311
Deputy?

16
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,157
Stay here.

17
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,500
Can I help you, ma'am?

18
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:33,504
Got thrown. Horse took off.

19
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,173
Messed up my leg.

20
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,095
- Let's move!

21
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:42,931
What is it?

22
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,811
- You wanna let me
out of these shackles?

23
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,190
Jesus, Deputy,
he's just a kid.

24
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,359
I won't hesitate to shoot you.

25
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:02,283
Hey, are you
really Calamity Jane?

26
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,534
Stop your whinin'.

27
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,333
Alton wants
your coachin' horses,

28
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,168
and your guns of course.

29
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,003
And any other valuables
you may be carrying

30
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,964
on your persons
or otherwise.

31
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,799
- Okay, on the count three.
- What? Wha--

32
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,510
- One.

33
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:24,222
Press down.

34
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,557
I am the Deputy Sheriff
in the city of Deadwood,

35
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:29,894
transportin' these prisoners
back to face justice.

36
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,854
And?

37
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,575
I'm afraid
we're at an impasse.

38
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,202
I'm not surrendering this stage.

39
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,834
- Get.

40
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,811
Take your time.

41
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,155
- Whoa! Whoa.

42
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:12,246
- What are you doin'?
- Well, I appreciate the help,

43
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:15,124
but that don't change the fact
you got a date with the judge.

44
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,336
You no-good son of a--

45
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,296
Where's Slaughter?

46
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,175
Didn't make it.

47
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,178
Goddamn it.

48
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:10,721
How'd our cargo fare?

49
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,352
- Two out of three.

50
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,729
- Come on.

51
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,403
Calamity fuckin' Jane.

52
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,197
You need to
get that kid a doctor.

53
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,199
I need to get you both
in that cell.

54
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,576
You swore an oath.

55
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:35,204
In a land built
on broken oaths?

56
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:41,085
He'll get a fair trial
if he lasts that long.

57
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,087
- Now...

58
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,927
if I were you, I'd be
a little more concerned

59
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,513
about my own prospects.

60
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,103
Keep watch, Deputy.

61
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,440
It'd be a shame if anything
happened to them.

62
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,442
Go on.

63
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:13,284
Yeah, from what I hear,
your sheriff ain't much
for following the law.

64
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,246
Rumor has it, he likes
being judge and executioner.

65
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:21,292
You okay with that?

66
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,755
What about me saving your ass?

67
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:30,259
You think saving a couple lives
absolves you of your sins?

68
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,221
Well, shit.

69
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,766
I figured it couldn't hurt.

70
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,155
Calamity...

71
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:56,786
Calamity Jane?

72
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,249
You know who I am?

73
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,797
No. Nor do I give
a buffalo shit.

74
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,510
Well,

75
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:16,430
I'm wanted for murder
in five states.

76
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,975
He says they gonna
hang me in the morning.

77
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,602
Well I tell you
a little secret?

78
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:24,522
Ain't the first time
that they try.

79
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,693
I ain't yet done
leaving my mark.

80
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,118
Hey. Hmm.

81
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,874
My brother's coming tomorrow
to bust me out.

82
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:49,839
I might let you come with us
if you ask nice.

83
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,217
I'm good.

84
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,388
You best not piss me off,

85
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:01,225
or you're gonna be...

86
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,353
next.

87
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,733
Yeah, that's right.
Take a nice look.

88
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,029
Hey.

89
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:16,824
Keep it down in there.

90
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:23,914
You're exactly the firestorm
I imagined, Calamity Jane.

91
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:32,923
Calamity Jane.

92
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:38,262
Calamity fuckin' Jane.

93
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,532
Whose the letter for?

94
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,619
- Nobody.
- Nobody?

95
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,622
You mean ain't nobody
gonna read your letter?

96
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:09,960
It's not a letter. It's a book.

97
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,587
A book?

98
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,594
I was covering the war
for Harper's Weekly

99
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:20,930
until the killing got to me.

100
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,808
Family's torn apart,
fighting one another,

101
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,601
it was a rotten deal.

102
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,647
So I headed out West
and here I am.

103
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,316
A writer.

104
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:34,944
Damn.

105
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,780
What's the book about?

106
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,449
So how'd you get
the name Calamity Jane?

107
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:42,827
I'm guessing your mama
didn't call you that.

108
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,413
Now, Deputy, you're not thinking
about putting little old me

109
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:48,290
- in your book now, are you?

110
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,753
They called me Martha.

111
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,506
Mama died of pneumonia
when I was 12.

112
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:58,801
Pa two years later,
leaving me to raise the family.

113
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,804
Now, Calamity.

114
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,974
You're gonna wanna
write this down.

115
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:08,769
Oh, well, is it--
is it story time now?

116
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,480
Sure is. And I'll be sure
to use small words for you.

117
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,316
- Hmm. Hmm.
- Now,

118
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,361
Calamity.

119
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,993
That name was given to me
by good old Cap Egan

120
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,537
when we was fighting Indians
just south of Goose Creek.

121
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,832
They ambushed us
about a mile from our post.

122
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:33,544
Cap Egan takes an arrow
and nearly dies twice
falling off his steed,

123
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:37,047
and I snatched him up
before they could maul him
and took one in the gut.

124
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,841
When we got back to camp,

125
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:43,304
he got the whole
regiment together,

126
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,847
made a toast.

127
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:50,686
To Calamity Jane,
Queen of the High Plain.

128
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,814
Or some shit like that.

129
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:57,735
Memory gets a little murky
on account of the whiskey.

130
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,029
Sounds like bullshit to me.

131
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:04,200
Hurts worse than
a conversation with a priest
when it rains.

132
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,076
Oh, that's a nice one.

133
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,246
You ever get tired of it?

134
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:12,583
Imagine a lot comes along
with a name like Calamity.

135
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,211
I suppose.

136
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:20,341
But now, history
doesn't remember Janes.

137
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,717
No, it don't.

138
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,054
Or Abigails.

139
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,097
Based off
the beautiful voice,

140
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:31,268
coach full of arrows tells me
that I'm in the right place.

141
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,020
About time.

142
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,065
- Can I help you, sir?
- Backin' the fuck up

143
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,691
would be a good start.

144
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,902
Holy shit.

145
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,571
Well, if it ain't
Wild Bill himself.

146
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:45,115
Ooh, you guys have a collection

147
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:49,870
of real nasty folks here,
don't we?

148
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,956
Got no quarrel
with you as of yet.

149
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,708
-  Mm, ooh.
- Or the law.

150
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,045
I'm just here to see
my wife-to-be.

151
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:01,423
Aw. Ain't that sweet.

152
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,468
Heard the coach got shot up.
Just wanted to make sure
that you were--

153
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,720
I'm fine,

154
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,056
as I can be under
the circumstances.

155
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:14,603
You smell good.

156
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,272
I smell like sweat.

157
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:17,940
That's what I said.

158
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,612
You left this.

159
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,952
Aren't you gonna put it on?

160
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,083
I got something else for you.

161
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,252
Do, you remember

162
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:42,131
that little plot of land
outside Lewis County?

163
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,507
Place with the wildflowers?

164
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,843
And the orchard with
the little apple trees.

165
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,931
It's ours now.

166
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,475
So what?

167
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:58,522
Wild Bill Hickok's
just gonna settle down
and become a fuckin' farmer?

168
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:02,318
That's exactly what
he's gonna do, with you.

169
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,653
Maybe a few little ones
running around.

170
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,952
-  Ugh.

171
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:22,171
Now, what trivial matter
did you arrest
my wife-to-be for?

172
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,465
She got drunk
and robbed some ranchers.

173
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:28,719
They were thieving wrestlers.
They besmirched my honor,

174
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,512
and I wasn't drunk.

175
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,556
Well, I can still smell
the whiskey.

176
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,684
I'll talk to the bellman
in the mornin'.

177
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:38,854
We'll have you outta here
'bout midday.

178
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:41,190
When the times
are getting dark,

179
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,734
and the night things
are growling at you,

180
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:48,072
remember to lean
on the good work
of the Lord for guidance.

181
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:54,495
Nothing wrong with spreading
the word of the Lord.

182
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,704
Yeah, well,

183
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:59,208
we don't see too much
of the good Lord
here in Deadwood.

184
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:09,218
Promise you'll go
straight to sleep
and wait for the magistrate.

185
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,011
Of course.

186
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,096
No drinking.

187
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:15,891
No cards.

188
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:21,730
I love you.

189
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,281
No fuckin' cards,
Bill, I mean it.

190
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,243
I heard you.
High noon tomorrow.

191
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,373
- Deputy.
- No fuckin' cards, Bill.

192
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,260
What are you doin'
with that killer?

193
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,932
You and I did some killing
earlier ourselves, Deputy,
or did you forget that already?

194
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,727
That was different.
We was defending ourselves.

195
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:00,978
Right.

196
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:05,107
There is a darkness
in his eyes.

197
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:08,819
- Is that right?
- You're different.

198
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,158
You ain't got what he got.

199
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,661
You sure about that?

200
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,463
You don't know shit about me.

201
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,806
There's good in Bill.

202
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:41,310
He just needs a little
salvation is all.

203
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,855
Salvation?

204
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,691
For people like us? Uh-uh.

205
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:51,278
There ain't nothing
waiting in the sky

206
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:54,531
- for savages and outlaws.

207
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:58,202
Ain't that right,
lawman?

208
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:08,170
Go on.

209
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,847
-  Get your asses
back upstairs

210
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,808
and pay what you owe!

211
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,070
Mmm.

212
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:36,156
Ah, keep 'em coming, sweetheart.

213
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,750
And on the seventh day,

214
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:50,087
the good Lord
sent his favorite son

215
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,882
to rob you bastards blind.

216
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:58,846
Whiskey.

217
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,187
Thank you.

218
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:12,734
Ain't no room for you
at this table, Wild Bill.

219
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,111
Jack McCall,

220
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:19,366
is that, uh, slavin',

221
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,076
whorin' brother Baron of yours

222
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:23,537
still making his living
off the backs of others?

223
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:26,790
If you know my brother,
you know he don't take kindly

224
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,750
to you insulting our name.

225
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,211
Yeah, I reckon
I don't give a fuck.

226
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:38,093
I'm afraid my man
Riley's sitting there.

227
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,341
Ten.

228
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:28,936
Raise.

229
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:31,188
Twenty.

230
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,199
Forty.

231
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,304
Well...

232
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:10,060
two pair. Aces high.

233
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:19,361
- You're fuckin' crazy,
just like they say.

234
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,406
What's the most
you ever lost on a hand?

235
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,868
What's the most
you ever lost on a hand?

236
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:29,496
'Cause my Colt

237
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:33,542
has been trained at your nuts
since I sat down.

238
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,920
Now, from what I can gather,

239
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:38,922
that's not a Colt.

240
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:43,593
And if it ain't, I don't think
I'd trust it in a gunfight.

241
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:47,931
Now your bullet
could go to the rig,
could go to the left.

242
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:53,061
That thing could backfire,
hit you right in the face,
which from where I'm sitting,

243
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,731
well, that'd be
a fuckin' improvement.

244
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,568
-  Only man here
allowed to dirty these floors

245
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,570
is my late husband.

246
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:13,040
Well, since the lady says so,

247
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,543
and since I'm in such
a good mood...

248
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,923
...I'm gonna let you live.

249
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:33,935
Jack, Jack, Jack, you--
you're forgetting something.

250
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,229
I-I don't reckon I did.

251
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:38,565
You-you forgot
to say thank you.

252
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:44,321
- What?
- You forgot to say thank you.

253
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:48,283
Thank you, Wild Bill.

254
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,287
Thank you for letting me live.

255
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:02,130
Thank you, Wild Bill,

256
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:04,299
- for letting me--
-  Oh, shit.

257
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,176
- You're really gonna do it.

258
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:09,179
Oh, I'm just fuckin'
with you. Thank you.

259
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:14,476
Okay.

260
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,653
Easy, easy.

261
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:09,656
Let me
ask you something.

262
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:15,245
As an outlaw, what would you say
you fear the most?

263
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,747
Mmm.

264
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:22,210
I'd say dumb fuckin' questions
are at the top of the list.

265
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,045
Death?

266
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:27,048
No. Died once already.

267
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,593
Drowned in the Platte River.

268
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,679
Just out for a swim, were you?

269
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:37,225
A hundred miles
working for General Crook.

270
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,686
Doc said I collapsed and died.

271
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:43,690
Fourteen days later,
I wake up in the hospital.

272
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,902
Sounds like a miracle.

273
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:50,280
Is that what you're gonna
put in your book? Hmm?

274
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:52,616
A miracle?

275
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,910
Sure. Why not?

276
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:57,913
Miracle's just another word
for dumb luck.

277
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,582
You don't believe in God?

278
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,752
You honestly think
it'd make a difference if I did?

279
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:06,296
I do.

280
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:10,467
- My rifle.

281
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,094
It's Wild Bill.

282
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,930
Jack McCall blew
his fuckin' brains out

283
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,806
- all over the saloon.
- Bullshit.

284
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,769
I've seen it myself.

285
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,104
The undertaker's got
his body already.

286
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:24,231
Let me out.

287
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,276
Now, I'm gonna go make sure
he doesn't skip town.

288
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:29,778
You stay here
and keep a look out.

289
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:33,448
- Are you sure you don't need--
- Stay here.

290
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,742
Oh, shit.
You really think

291
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:40,789
Rick knows Jack McCall
killed Wild Bill Hickok?

292
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,165
Ooh.

293
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,459
Wild Bill shot
my friend's uncle

294
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,504
outside of Promise, Nevada,
without no provoking.

295
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:50,090
He got what was coming to him.

296
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:58,640
Maybe that's just God's way
of evening things out.

297
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,521
- Jane! Hey!

298
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:08,316
- Oh, no, pretty face.

299
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:27,335
I saved your life.

300
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:29,212
Thank you very much.

301
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,172
Oh. Ahem.

302
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:37,304
Ah, don't take it personal.

303
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,687
You know what I wish?

304
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:49,524
I wish it were me
that had done it.

305
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,527
Could you imagine?

306
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:55,697
Me...

307
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,243
the man who killed Wild Bill?

308
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:05,874
Oh.

309
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,376
You're a dead man.

310
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,212
Oh, what was that?

311
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:17,218
Come-- come again?

312
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:20,722
Okay, calm.

313
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:26,436
- C-calm, calm, calm, calm now.

314
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,021
Okay.

315
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:34,611
Oh, rawr.

316
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:44,746
- Night-night.

317
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:59,594
You'll hang after trial.

318
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,471
Don't throw your life away.

319
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,266
What life?

320
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:06,935
- Jane!

321
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:10,105
She has got more grit

322
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,065
than a Texas tornado,
don't she?

323
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:14,484
Fuck.

324
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:22,784
- Now, when you put this part

325
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:26,413
in your little book,
make sure you get
my name right.

326
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,581
It's Abigail,
with two "I's."

327
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:30,625
- Ooh!

328
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,337
You're a thoroughbred,
aren't you, lawman?

329
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:37,799
Mm.

330
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,476
Ah, come on.

331
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,162
What you got there, hmm?

332
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,831
Whiskey, for the hotel.

333
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:22,051
- Mm.

334
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,887
You seen Jack McCall?

335
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:25,555
No.

336
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,641
Do you know where maybe
I could find him?

337
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:32,687
Last time he came through here,
he stayed at the Stone Inn.

338
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:37,233
How about I come
and see you tonight?

339
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:38,359
I don't think so.

340
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,362
It's gonna be real busy
at the saloon.

341
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,369
I'll see you tonight.

342
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,062
Come on.

343
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,072
Where are they?

344
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,870
What happened to him?

345
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:35,208
Calamity Jane.

346
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,085
I left you ten minutes ago.

347
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:40,964
Keys?

348
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,894
Hmm, won't be needing that.

349
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:55,979
Mmm.

350
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:02,652
Careful now. You're about
to get in bed with the man

351
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:06,155
who killed frontier legend
Wild Bill Hickok.

352
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:10,994
You son of a bitch!

353
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:24,007
- I will kill you!

354
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:34,517
- I got money.
- You think this is about money?

355
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,603
Yeah, well,
Wild Bill's dead.

356
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:44,485
- Hey.

357
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,529
- Hey, hey, hey, goddamn it.

358
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,120
- Get outta my way!
- You gonna execute me

359
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,623
- like you did Sheriff Griggs?
- Jack shot Griggs.

360
00:31:56,623 --> 00:32:00,001
Step aside, Deputy.
He dies, here and now.

361
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:03,379
He'll stand trial
and he'll be hung.

362
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:04,547
He shot Bill.

363
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:08,718
Just let me help you.
Please, just put down the gun.

364
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:10,845
I gotta take you back in.

365
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:12,972
You say you didn't kill
the sheriff?

366
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:15,224
Well, you can tell that
to the judge.

367
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:20,688
He shot Bill.

368
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:37,538
-  Where'd she go?
-  That way, that way!

369
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,084
Fuck.

370
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:48,091
-  Alright, come on now.

371
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:51,052
Oh, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

372
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:53,096
-  Come on, this way.
- Move.

373
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,395
Hey, look who it is.
We came to break you out.

374
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,065
Sorry to ruin it
for you, baby brother.
Waited as long as I could.

375
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,858
What the hell are we
supposed to do now?

376
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:09,904
Well, first I'm gonna
get me a drink

377
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:12,907
and then I'm sure we'll figure
something out, won't we?

378
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,243
- Come on now, let's go.

379
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,245
- Whoo-hoo!

380
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:48,943
Surveyor told me this place
belongs to Wild Bill Hickok.

381
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:59,287
Ran into a couple ranchers
this morning.

382
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,956
Said they saw you
heading up this way.

383
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:08,087
Jane?

384
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,012
I'm coming in.

385
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,641
I don't wanna shoot you...

386
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:22,643
- ...but I will.

387
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:24,974
-  Make a noise
and your dead

388
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,809
before you hit the ground.

389
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:28,769
You the gravedigger?

390
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:29,812
Yes, ma'am.

391
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,606
Do I need to worry about you

392
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,482
trying to stuff me in a box?

393
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,903
I don't do the killings
around here.

394
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,115
He's...

395
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:43,784
he's one of them?

396
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:46,412
Bill?

397
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:50,333
This one here.

398
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,368
Oh, you cleaned him up
real nice.

399
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:26,702
You knew him?

400
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:29,163
Clothes. Where are his clothes?

401
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:33,334
Uh, we burned 'em. That's--
that's--that's tradition.

402
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,044
Did he have
anything on him?

403
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:38,130
No, ma'am. Not by the time
he got to me, he didn't.

404
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:43,177
Can you give us a moment?

405
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:03,364
I love you too.

406
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:16,002
Can you do me
a favor, gravedigger?

407
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:21,507
On his tombstone,

408
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:22,883
can you write

409
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,095
that he was a decent man?

410
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,433
Was he?

411
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:31,892
He wanted to be.

412
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,397
That's got to account
for something, right?

413
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:46,532
May I ask who's makin'
the request?

414
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,244
His wife.

415
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:17,313
You know, I've been thinking
about what I'd do

416
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,273
if I had found myself
a gold mine.

417
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:21,275
Yeah, you're thinking,
were you?

418
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:25,613
Well, I figured
first thing I'd do is,

419
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,990
I'd buy myself
a brand-new Winchester,

420
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,742
- some land...

421
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,952
and a whole goddamn lot
of them fancy Scottish cattle

422
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,662
like Old Mr. Foster had.

423
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:37,500
What'd you do, Abigail?

424
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:41,754
If you had a gold mine,
I'd kill you
and take all your gold.

425
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,172
- No.

426
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,924
That's not what I was saying.

427
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:48,469
West's all one big
rotten fuckin' drain.

428
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,313
- You sure he's coming?

429
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:01,190
Uh, he said
he was coming, yeah.

430
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:03,526
And he said he was gonna
pay us 400 a piece

431
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,152
to take him
to see his brother?

432
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:06,654
Yeah, that's
what he said, 400.

433
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,489
- Five hundred.
- Whoa.

434
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:12,701
Holy shit.

435
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:15,663
If it ain't Jack McCall himself.

436
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,958
This is the man
you was talking about?

437
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,001
Uh-huh. That's him.

438
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:25,047
You're fixing to pay us
500 a piece

439
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:26,882
to take you to see your brother?

440
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,676
- That's right.
-  Why?

441
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,136
Passing through the Badlands

442
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,471
and need some protection,
is all.

443
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:33,973
You interested?

444
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:38,394
If you got the gold, we are.

445
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:44,066
There's a thousand
in gold right there.

446
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:47,153
My brother
will give you the rest
when you take me to him.

447
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:50,072
- Mm. Is that right?

448
00:40:57,663 --> 00:41:01,417
Put 'em down.
We leave at first light.

449
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:06,714
- Come on.

450
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,842
And I swear to God, brother,
if you play the harmonica
one more time,

451
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,510
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you.

452
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,605
What happens now?

453
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:25,733
Now...

454
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,070
I'm gonna kill Jack McCall.

455
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,409
You know, a...

456
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:38,454
a man wiser than me once said,

457
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,956
if you go to embark
on a quest for revenge,

458
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:44,710
you better build two graves.

459
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:48,714
One for them
and one for yourself.

460
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:52,468
That just sounds like
a lot of fuckin' digging.

461
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:56,055
You even know
where he's headed?

462
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:59,600
I hear his brother runs a bunch
of gold mines out east.

463
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:05,147
Well, the only way to reach
those gold mines out east

464
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:06,941
is to travel through
the Badlands.

465
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:09,276
Gangs covering that territory.

466
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,820
Scalp-hunting
ex-Confederate devils

467
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:15,616
that make the savages
look like English royalty.

468
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:21,956
Why do I get the funny feeling
you might know another way?

469
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,457
'Cause I might.

470
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:27,586
What'll it cost me?

471
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:30,422
- Whatever you think's fair.
- How does it work?

472
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:34,468
We just go right on through.

473
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:36,679
Right on through
the ex-Confederate devils

474
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:39,848
that make the savages
look like English royalty?

475
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:44,144
Undertaker gets a free pass.

476
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:47,356
I gotta go through there
to pick up the product.

477
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:54,989
I really am
gonna kill Jack McCall,

478
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,782
and you better not
get in my way.

479
00:42:57,616 --> 00:43:00,119
You pull the trigger,
I'll build the coffin.

480
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:21,724
Calamity Jane is wanted
for the death of Sheriff Griggs.

481
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:25,227
Jack McCall
is wanted for the death
of Wild Bill Hickok.

482
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:28,355
Two fugitives, three bodies,

483
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,233
and one of them our own.

484
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:35,696
Hell of a night,
even for Deadwood.

485
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:43,495
This is a hunt.
We are bringing them back
to the hangman.

486
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:46,582
If we don't kill them ourselves,
well we don't let 'em go either.

487
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,918
We bring 'em back here
for justice.

488
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:52,755
As the acting sheriff,
I have been authorized

489
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:56,216
to deputize you men to carry out
the law of this land.

490
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,404
Will nobody here stand
for Sheriff Briggs?

491
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:36,590
Anyone else?

492
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:46,058
You barely look
old enough to drink.

493
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,559
You know how to wield an iron?

494
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:49,561
No age requirement
on doing what's right.

495
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:57,069
You know how to use that thing?

496
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,446
I've been shooting
since I was nine.

497
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:10,999
Anyone else?

498
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:17,005
Three of y'all.
That's your posse?

499
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,683
I saw Calamity Jane.
She's with the undertaker,

500
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,518
and they're headed
for the Badlands.

501
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:37,359
Well, get some shut-eye.
We ride at first light.

502
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:29,328
Find it helps keep
the devil at bay,

503
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:32,372
at least until morning.

504
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:34,082
Devil ain't real.

505
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,918
Probably God neither.

506
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:39,713
The only thing
that's real is pain.

507
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:41,882
I hate to be the bearer
of bad news,

508
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:44,426
but there's a long fucking line
of people ahead of you

509
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:47,012
with a bone to pick
with the Almighty.

510
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:48,055
Yeah.

511
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:52,017
What'd you lose that's got you
so pissed off at God?

512
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:17,626
The fire's a lot less merciful
than a bullet.

513
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:25,759
Even if you get your revenge,

514
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:28,095
you're gonna be dealing
with the pain.

515
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:31,807
You can trust me on that.

516
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,800
-  Whoa.

517
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:09,845
- No.

518
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:13,432
It's the way out here.

519
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:17,519
It's the way
of the world, really.

520
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:21,857
Welcome to the Badlands.

521
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:38,206
Whoa.

522
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:47,299
Looks like it's time
to play dead.

523
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:09,154
Hiya.

524
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:27,255
Whoa, chief.
That's far enough.

525
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:31,718
State your business.

526
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:35,722
Got a body to deliver
to Willow Creek.

527
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:44,606
Gun or the gold.
What'll it be?

528
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:51,738
Don't mind them.

529
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:52,906
They get a little excited

530
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,783
seeing fresh heads roll in.

531
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:03,583
What do you think
a scalp like that
will fetch in market, boys?

532
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,091
Ain't enough.

533
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:15,303
What do you mean, sir?

534
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:17,305
I mean, it ain't
fuckin' enough.

535
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,474
Rusty said it was two pieces.

536
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:21,143
Oh, Rusty said?

537
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:22,769
Rusty.

538
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:27,816
Can you hear me, Rusty?

539
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:30,110
Rusty?

540
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:33,780
Shit, I don't think he can hear
much of anything anymore.

541
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:38,285
Look, all I'm fixing to do
is deliver a man
to his loved ones.

542
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:40,495
You're lucky we're out here
looking out for you.

543
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,456
You need roughnecks
like us out here

544
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:44,833
protecting your interests.

545
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:47,836
'Cause these Badlands
become lawless,

546
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:50,964
filled with nothing
but fuckin' savages.

547
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:56,678
You got a live one back the?

548
00:50:58,513 --> 00:51:00,932
Sometimes the pine warps.

549
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,980
Let's take a look at that
fancy woodwork.

550
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,551
- Oh, shit. Hey.

551
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:39,346
-  Hey.

552
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:49,231
- Thanks.

553
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:55,237
Oh, shit.

554
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:25,267
Here, okay?

555
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:26,768
Why are you doing this?

556
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:28,228
I need a ride.

557
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:30,730
Bullshit.

558
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:33,775
It's 'cause of this.

559
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:37,571
Well, don't go telling nobody.

560
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:40,282
- Let me see.

561
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:44,119
Wait, just stop moving.

562
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:46,788
- I'm trying to stop the--
- Okay, okay.

563
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,128
Just let me enjoy the stars.

564
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:28,455
I shouldn't have
brought you here.

565
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:33,001
I always thought
when this moment came,

566
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:34,836
I'd be scared, but...

567
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:39,299
I'm not.

568
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:40,967
Shh.

569
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:42,344
Save your strength.

570
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:45,931
All we can do
is try, you know?

571
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:50,101
That's all we got.

572
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,981
It's just knowing that...

573
00:53:58,276 --> 00:54:00,445
when the end
comes at some point

574
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:02,113
in your life, you...

575
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:05,992
try to do some good.

576
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:12,707
Well,

577
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:16,962
maybe if you're lucky,
the good outweighs the bad.

578
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:28,723
You know, they say I swam
100 miles in freezing river?

579
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:31,893
- I heard that.

580
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:33,353
Well, I...

581
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:38,566
I, uh, I never swam the Platte.

582
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:45,699
Technically, I did, because
I fell in drunk,
damn near drowned.

583
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:51,871
Well, I mean,
you still got time.

584
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,001
From what I heard though,
it's pretty fuckin' cold.

585
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:00,505
Yeah.

586
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:06,511
Oh...

587
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:06,464
Whoa.

588
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:35,326
She here?

589
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:38,246
Nope.

590
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,592
Tracks are fresh.

591
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:55,054
She's close.

592
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:11,112
Whoa.

593
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:46,648
- Miss me? Please don't.

594
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:50,735
I shoot you, it's your brains
all over my pretty face.

595
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:56,324
- There we go.

596
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:01,454
Nice and slow.

597
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:07,627
Hi there.

598
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:15,677
Well, that's disappointing.

599
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:25,436
You got Jack McCall in there?

600
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:27,313
I do.

601
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:29,816
You gonna give him to me?

602
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:33,194
I'm not.

603
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:37,115
- Why?
- Well, for one thing, attitude.

604
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:39,617
I'm just kiddin'.

605
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:43,538
He has gold.
Lots and lots of gold.

606
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:47,834
Well, you know, some things
are more important than gold.

607
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:51,296
You're funny.

608
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:53,548
Hands where I can see them.

609
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:56,134
-  Damn it.

610
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:12,859
We got the place surrounded.

611
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:17,488
We're here for the outlaw,
Jack McCall...

612
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:21,367
and Calamity Jane.

613
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:28,207
Both wanted for murder.
Nobody has to die here today.

614
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:34,213
A shot like that,
Wild Bill'd still be alive.

615
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:36,257
I'ma kill you, Jack.

616
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:38,426
You kill him,
you hang for sure.

617
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:43,264
There's two types
of people, Jack!

618
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:46,517
Runners and gunners.

619
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,395
Which one are you?

620
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:59,405
Harper,
we'll get them from behind.

621
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:12,585
Take me to my fuckin' brother.

622
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:15,421
Get your hands off me. Get up.

623
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:27,266
I'm bringing you in.

624
01:01:27,433 --> 01:01:29,310
Jack killed your sheriff.

625
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:32,105
Killed a lot of people
in my time, never claimed that
I didn't kill one that I did.

626
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,731
Jack pulled that trigger,

627
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:36,484
not me.

628
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:48,955
- You got any more bullets?

629
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:58,840
How'd that bullet
taste, shit bag?

630
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:00,925
It's just a scratch.

631
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,514
- What happened?
- Three of them took off,
on horseback.

632
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:09,308
- We got one pinned in here.

633
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:47,722
You gonna make us come
all the way up there and get ya?

634
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:50,683
Taking you in, dead or alive.

635
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:59,192
No one takes a Hollan
brother alive.

636
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:24,550
- Where's Jack?
- I don't know where Jack is.

637
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:26,886
-  Really?

638
01:03:27,011 --> 01:03:28,596
Yeah.

639
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:31,098
'Cause that feels
like information
you might have shared.

640
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:37,063
I keep digging around in there,
and gangrenes gonna get it.

641
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:40,024
Even if you live,
somebody's gonna have
to lop the fucker off.

642
01:03:40,024 --> 01:03:44,403
Okay, okay, okay! Okay,
they headed just north of here.

643
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:47,073
There's a camp.

644
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,450
It's Jack's brother's new mines.

645
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:51,035
Where?

646
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:56,624
God! God!
God, I'll tell you!
I'll tell you on the map.

647
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:58,417
I'll tell you on the map.

648
01:03:58,584 --> 01:04:01,754
Jesus Christ. Just...
Just stop. Just stop.

649
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:11,639
Fire's warmer here. That's all.

650
01:04:17,895 --> 01:04:20,731
Can you tell me
what's taking you so long
to write that book?

651
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:23,818
What's it about?

652
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:30,283
An outlaw tryin' to do right.

653
01:04:30,449 --> 01:04:32,785
Good luck with that.

654
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:34,579
Yeah. Luck ain't got
nothing to do with it.

655
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:36,455
Maybe your problem
is that everybody's got

656
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:38,457
some good and evil in him.

657
01:04:41,794 --> 01:04:43,254
I ain't gotta worry
about you tomorrow, do I?

658
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:45,631
Bring back Jack in handcuffs,
not a coffin.

659
01:04:45,756 --> 01:04:47,341
What if it was your wife
who he shot in the back?

660
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:49,468
- I ain't got a wife.
- Mm.

661
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:53,180
Not anymore.

662
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:56,642
What happened?

663
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:03,941
Seven years ago when I was away
coverin' the war for Harper's,

664
01:05:06,193 --> 01:05:08,446
gang of bandits
ambushed our town.

665
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:12,700
That's when I gave up writing
and took off for the law.

666
01:05:12,825 --> 01:05:15,202
You didn't think about
riding out and killing him?

667
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:16,704
I tried to find 'em.

668
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:20,833
All I found was the bottom
of a bottle.

669
01:05:24,712 --> 01:05:27,131
Is that why you
picked up the badge?

670
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:28,841
Revenge?

671
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:34,555
I was drinking myself to death
when I found myself in debt.

672
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:37,558
I woke up one morning
staring straight
into the eyes of a killer.

673
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:39,685
I must have pissed off someone.

674
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:43,564
He pulled the trigger.

675
01:05:45,524 --> 01:05:46,734
Gun misfired.

676
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:51,906
Right there and then, I decided
it was a sign from my wife.

677
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:56,494
To do good.

678
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:52,425
I'm going.

679
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:53,801
Somethin' doesn't feel right.

680
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:57,596
Now why the hell you go and say
a thing like that? Hmm?

681
01:06:57,722 --> 01:06:59,098
That's bad luck.

682
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:01,892
- We make our own luck.
- Mm-hmm.

683
01:07:08,899 --> 01:07:10,109
Well, I like her.

684
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:13,988
She got spunk.

685
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:18,075
She's got something.

686
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:32,066
Mine's not far.
Probably up there.

687
01:08:36,987 --> 01:08:38,823
Gatling gun.

688
01:08:45,496 --> 01:08:46,747
Shit.

689
01:08:50,584 --> 01:08:52,086
There's too many of 'em.

690
01:08:52,878 --> 01:08:55,381
- There's just more targets.
- Drop 'em.

691
01:08:57,675 --> 01:08:59,093
I said drop it.

692
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:00,928
You're gonna have to make me.

693
01:09:05,891 --> 01:09:08,727
What are we waitin' for?
Stop wastin' time.

694
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:10,771
- Let's just finish 'em.
- Ah-ah-ah.

695
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:13,190
We're not savages here.

696
01:09:14,608 --> 01:09:16,694
Let's hear what these
good folk have to say

697
01:09:16,694 --> 01:09:18,696
before we go about
ending anyone's days.

698
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:19,780
No, fuck that.

699
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:21,448
I'm 'a shoot 'em myself.

700
01:09:22,283 --> 01:09:24,368
You will do nothi'
of the sort.

701
01:09:29,748 --> 01:09:32,126
Now,

702
01:09:33,794 --> 01:09:35,296
how can we help you, Sheriff?

703
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:36,589
You can hand over

704
01:09:36,755 --> 01:09:38,424
that murderin' son of a bitch.

705
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:40,259
Well,

706
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:43,762
you see, the problem is...

707
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:45,806
you're right.

708
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:48,893
He is a son of a bitch.

709
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:52,563
But that bitch was our mother,

710
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:57,318
which makes this particular
murderin' piece of shit
my brother.

711
01:09:57,484 --> 01:09:59,320
The man you are
harborin' is wanted

712
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:01,655
by the federal government
for the murder of Bill Hickok

713
01:10:01,822 --> 01:10:03,157
and Sheriff Charles Griggs.

714
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:09,622
Well, now, it appears
we're at a bit of an impasse.

715
01:10:09,788 --> 01:10:10,915
What you mean?

716
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:14,335
These lands here aren't
under the jurisdiction

717
01:10:14,501 --> 01:10:17,838
of any government,
federal or otherwise.

718
01:10:18,839 --> 01:10:20,507
They're mine.

719
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:23,677
He needs to stand trial
for what he did.

720
01:10:23,802 --> 01:10:26,847
I understand. I really do.

721
01:10:27,514 --> 01:10:32,311
But I'm afraid
I cannot let him hang.

722
01:10:33,354 --> 01:10:37,191
You see, Jack here, ahem,
tends to our Mama's grave

723
01:10:38,442 --> 01:10:39,860
for some reason I...

724
01:10:40,861 --> 01:10:43,822
I have never been able
to fuckin' fathom.

725
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,159
He was always her favorite.

726
01:10:56,543 --> 01:10:57,836
I'll kill him.

727
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:12,351
- They knocked up my leg.
- Mm-hmm. It hurt?

728
01:11:13,894 --> 01:11:15,896
Mm-hmm.

729
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:25,239
You led 'em right to us,
you dumb fuck.

730
01:11:30,202 --> 01:11:31,870
-  Oh.

731
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:40,379
It appears your negotiating
position has changed.

732
01:11:44,216 --> 01:11:47,886
Why don't you go ahead,
drop those weapons.

733
01:11:48,929 --> 01:11:50,097
Mm-hmm.

734
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:14,455
Get behind the wagon!

735
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:20,210
- Go!

736
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:26,592
What are you doin', kid?

737
01:12:27,801 --> 01:12:29,094
No!

738
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:38,896
I got you.

739
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:51,116
I'll hold their fire.
You head for the horses.

740
01:12:51,283 --> 01:12:52,493
- Fuck.

741
01:13:10,094 --> 01:13:11,845
- Woo-wee!

742
01:13:12,012 --> 01:13:15,099
She got more fight in her
than all you spineless dogs!

743
01:13:18,435 --> 01:13:20,145
Where's that lawman?

744
01:13:20,312 --> 01:13:23,816
Curled up somewhere
with shit in his drawers?

745
01:13:48,173 --> 01:13:50,217
She was destruction

746
01:13:50,342 --> 01:13:53,011
given form and purpose.

747
01:14:00,227 --> 01:14:02,354
You got spirit, girl.

748
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:05,524
I could use someone like you.

749
01:14:06,024 --> 01:14:07,734
You could use a bath.

750
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:16,535
That's not very
becoming of a lady.

751
01:14:27,045 --> 01:14:29,423
Mmm.

752
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:37,848
That deed ain't in your name.

753
01:14:37,848 --> 01:14:39,391
Yeah, well, you see,

754
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:41,101
that's where having
a relationship

755
01:14:41,226 --> 01:14:44,104
with a Homestead Act magistrate
comes in handy.

756
01:14:44,271 --> 01:14:46,231
That stolen property
belongs to me.

757
01:14:46,356 --> 01:14:48,942
He who holds the deed,
holds the land.

758
01:14:49,443 --> 01:14:52,237
I'm gonna enjoy spending time
with my brand-new land

759
01:14:52,404 --> 01:14:54,740
courtesy of Wild Bill Hickok.

760
01:14:55,449 --> 01:15:00,037
Or, hell, maybe I'll just burn
the whole thing to the ground.

761
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:04,416
I'm gonna enjoy killing you.

762
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:18,222
This is how we take the West.

763
01:15:19,431 --> 01:15:20,432
We take,

764
01:15:21,141 --> 01:15:23,268
we kill,

765
01:15:23,435 --> 01:15:26,271
we dance with savages
and wallows.

766
01:15:28,315 --> 01:15:30,651
I'll tell you
what's gonna happen.

767
01:15:32,486 --> 01:15:35,280
I'm gonna take my deed back,

768
01:15:35,447 --> 01:15:37,282
and I'm gonna kill you

769
01:15:38,659 --> 01:15:40,285
and your brother.

770
01:15:41,578 --> 01:15:45,791
And then I'm gonna dance
on your fucking grave.

771
01:15:57,594 --> 01:15:58,845
What are you laughing at?

772
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:03,934
You shot her husband
in the back.

773
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:05,185
So what?

774
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:13,694
I want some time with her.

775
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:14,987
Don't be long.

776
01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:18,824
Gotta get that gold over
that mountain before snowfall.

777
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:24,830
Jane.

778
01:16:39,511 --> 01:16:41,221
This is it, gentlemen.

779
01:16:42,222 --> 01:16:45,309
This is why we came out west.

780
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:49,896
Yes, it is true.

781
01:16:51,189 --> 01:16:52,691
We lost some good men.

782
01:16:54,359 --> 01:16:56,862
But that just means
more share for us.

783
01:16:58,655 --> 01:17:00,741
We got ourselves one hell
of a haul here, boys.

784
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:04,161
However,

785
01:17:05,495 --> 01:17:09,583
Uncle Sam knows
it's out here, same as us.

786
01:17:10,917 --> 01:17:15,047
So that means we gotta
take it quick as we can.

787
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:20,719
Well, what are you
waiting for?

788
01:17:24,931 --> 01:17:28,894
Oh, and please,
mind the dynamite.

789
01:17:29,019 --> 01:17:30,604
It's fuckin' expensive.

790
01:17:38,528 --> 01:17:40,072
Look at you.

791
01:17:40,238 --> 01:17:42,574
Calamity fuckin' Jane.

792
01:17:44,284 --> 01:17:46,953
Defenseless.

793
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:51,083
You know, you and I,
we're the same.

794
01:17:51,249 --> 01:17:52,918
We're nothing alike.

795
01:17:54,294 --> 01:17:55,962
You stabbed your own
fuckin' brother.

796
01:17:58,048 --> 01:17:59,132
You made me.

797
01:17:59,299 --> 01:18:01,218
I didn't make you do shit.

798
01:18:03,303 --> 01:18:05,263
Mmm.

799
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:06,723
You and I could've
been friends.

800
01:18:06,723 --> 01:18:07,808
Really?

801
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:09,601
Sure. Why not?

802
01:18:13,397 --> 01:18:15,565
Oh.

803
01:18:15,565 --> 01:18:18,443
You're too good, is that it?

804
01:18:18,568 --> 01:18:20,612
No, I'm not good.

805
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:24,324
Not even close.

806
01:18:28,412 --> 01:18:30,914
Wild Bill, gone.

807
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:34,835
Acres of beautiful
country, gone.

808
01:18:35,001 --> 01:18:36,837
Freedom, gone.

809
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:39,089
You ever shut the fuck up?

810
01:18:39,089 --> 01:18:41,800
The legend of Calamity Jane,

811
01:18:42,467 --> 01:18:45,804
it's gonna be forgotten like
a speck of dust in the desert.

812
01:18:46,596 --> 01:18:48,598
But it's gonna
live on right here.

813
01:18:48,598 --> 01:18:53,854
You see, you're gonna be
the one adding to my legend...

814
01:18:55,355 --> 01:18:56,773
right here.

815
01:19:01,528 --> 01:19:04,823
Shut up or kill me,
you fuckin' imbecile.

816
01:19:11,538 --> 01:19:13,290
Hey, Jane, get up.

817
01:19:15,208 --> 01:19:16,376
Get up.

818
01:19:18,044 --> 01:19:20,881
Ain't nothin' left.

819
01:19:22,382 --> 01:19:23,675
I'm tired.

820
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:25,385
So you just gonna lay there

821
01:19:25,552 --> 01:19:27,554
and die in the fuckin' weeds?

822
01:19:29,639 --> 01:19:31,391
There she is.

823
01:19:33,351 --> 01:19:35,479
We were gonna get married.

824
01:19:35,479 --> 01:19:37,731
Gonna live out our days

825
01:19:37,898 --> 01:19:40,525
fat and happy
on a beautiful ranch

826
01:19:40,692 --> 01:19:44,738
at the edge of some
God-forsaken little town.

827
01:19:45,572 --> 01:19:47,407
Were you telling the truth?

828
01:19:47,574 --> 01:19:49,409
I only ever
told you the truth.

829
01:19:49,534 --> 01:19:52,412
And the truth is,
right now...

830
01:19:53,246 --> 01:19:54,831
...if you don't wake up,

831
01:19:57,375 --> 01:19:59,044
you're gonna die.

832
01:20:01,421 --> 01:20:04,549
Come on, stand up.

833
01:20:04,674 --> 01:20:09,012
Stand up. Come on,
there you go.

834
01:20:09,012 --> 01:20:10,764
Now, okay.

835
01:20:15,727 --> 01:20:17,729
Tell me what your name is.

836
01:20:19,731 --> 01:20:21,399
What's your name?

837
01:20:22,359 --> 01:20:23,443
What's your name?

838
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:25,946
Jane.

839
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:28,198
Calamity Jane.

840
01:20:30,534 --> 01:20:33,453
Calamity Jane.

841
01:20:39,417 --> 01:20:41,086
Are you still here?

842
01:20:49,803 --> 01:20:51,763
I grew up with four brothers,

843
01:20:51,888 --> 01:20:53,974
and I got three left
on account of you.

844
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:58,770
You see around here,
we like to make things right.

845
01:20:59,604 --> 01:21:01,773
Even, you know?

846
01:21:08,488 --> 01:21:10,949
An eye for an eye.

847
01:21:11,074 --> 01:21:13,118
No, I didn't touch
your brother, I...

848
01:21:14,661 --> 01:21:16,454
I just fucked up
his leg a little.

849
01:21:21,167 --> 01:21:23,628
I might let you
keep one of your eyes.

850
01:21:23,795 --> 01:21:26,006
That way you can still
make a decent wage

851
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:27,674
at the whore house.

852
01:21:29,134 --> 01:21:32,679
You deserve your revenge.
I get that.

853
01:21:32,804 --> 01:21:35,849
But there's something
you should know about me.

854
01:21:37,017 --> 01:21:38,101
Hmm?

855
01:21:38,643 --> 01:21:40,645
I can't work at a whore house.

856
01:21:43,315 --> 01:21:44,858
And why is that?

857
01:21:47,527 --> 01:21:48,820
I'm married.

858
01:21:54,367 --> 01:21:55,619
I'll get you!

859
01:22:21,978 --> 01:22:24,397
You gotta be
fuckin' kidding me.

860
01:22:24,564 --> 01:22:25,857
Missed me.

861
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:44,501
-  Oh, Calamity Jane.

862
01:22:44,501 --> 01:22:48,254
- You know what I think?

863
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:50,507
I think I'm the real Calamity.

864
01:22:50,507 --> 01:22:52,384
A more powerful version,

865
01:22:52,509 --> 01:22:55,178
and the creature
that's lurking inside of you.

866
01:22:55,178 --> 01:22:58,014
Well, guess what, Jane?
That monster's here,

867
01:22:58,014 --> 01:22:59,891
and it's gonna tear you
fuckin' apart!

868
01:23:00,016 --> 01:23:01,768
What the fuck
are you talking about?

869
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:26,626
What the hell
are you doing here?

870
01:23:26,793 --> 01:23:28,461
- Rescuing you.

871
01:23:28,628 --> 01:23:30,630
Timing could use some work.

872
01:23:31,798 --> 01:23:33,258
Where the hell are they?

873
01:23:33,967 --> 01:23:35,802
There's a bunch of 'em with
Jack and Baron up in the mine.

874
01:23:35,969 --> 01:23:38,722
We're never gonna be able
to get 'em all.
We need some help.

875
01:23:38,722 --> 01:23:42,809
Your last posse left up to be
desired on the numbers side.
Do you think you could get more?

876
01:23:43,601 --> 01:23:46,271
- I'm not so sure.

877
01:23:47,605 --> 01:23:48,982
I have an idea.

878
01:23:53,611 --> 01:23:54,904
Let's pick up the pace, boys.

879
01:23:54,904 --> 01:23:56,614
I want this all packed
and loaded

880
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:57,782
before sunrise tomorrow.

881
01:23:57,907 --> 01:23:59,909
Come on now, let's move it.

882
01:24:10,003 --> 01:24:12,839
Baron. You seeing this?

883
01:24:26,770 --> 01:24:29,189
- Whoa.

884
01:24:31,608 --> 01:24:33,151
What do you want, lawman?

885
01:24:34,486 --> 01:24:36,821
I'm here to arrest Jack McCall,

886
01:24:36,946 --> 01:24:39,491
murder of Wild Bill Hickok.

887
01:24:39,657 --> 01:24:41,117
You gonna come peacefully?

888
01:24:41,659 --> 01:24:43,995
I admire the commitment,
I really do.

889
01:24:44,704 --> 01:24:47,207
However, you appear
to be a bit shorthanded,

890
01:24:47,832 --> 01:24:51,169
and I am afraid we're
gonna need that wagon.

891
01:24:51,336 --> 01:24:52,837
Last chance, Baron.

892
01:25:01,387 --> 01:25:03,807
I like the odds on my side.

893
01:25:05,016 --> 01:25:06,893
I think I can hear those odds!

894
01:25:11,314 --> 01:25:15,652
Deputy here made me promise
to give you a chance
to change your minds.

895
01:25:28,665 --> 01:25:30,250
I'm here to arrest Jack McCall

896
01:25:30,375 --> 01:25:32,210
for the murder
of Wild Bill Hickok.

897
01:25:35,755 --> 01:25:37,048
Whatcha say, Baron?

898
01:25:58,611 --> 01:25:59,779
Baron?

899
01:26:11,916 --> 01:26:13,793
- Take him.
-  No!

900
01:26:15,461 --> 01:26:16,713
They'll hang me.

901
01:26:18,256 --> 01:26:19,299
They'll hang me!

902
01:26:20,425 --> 01:26:21,551
They'll hang me!

903
01:26:46,326 --> 01:26:48,745
You trying to bring
this whole mine down?

904
01:26:48,745 --> 01:26:51,497
If I die, I'm taking
you with me.

905
01:27:06,804 --> 01:27:07,972
Jane!

906
01:27:12,477 --> 01:27:14,479
Guess we found out
you're a runner,

907
01:27:14,646 --> 01:27:15,855
huh, Jack?

908
01:28:14,580 --> 01:28:15,832
Fuck.

909
01:28:24,924 --> 01:28:26,009
You feel that?

910
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:31,264
That cold trickling
up your spine.

911
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:34,434
That's death comin' for you.

912
01:28:46,571 --> 01:28:48,072
That's me.

913
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:50,700
Look... I have money.

914
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:52,243
I've heard that one before.

915
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:57,373
This is what you want,
right? Right?

916
01:28:59,459 --> 01:29:00,460
Take it.

917
01:29:07,216 --> 01:29:08,426
What I want...

918
01:29:11,596 --> 01:29:12,930
What I want...

919
01:29:13,806 --> 01:29:15,433
is what you took from me.

920
01:29:16,726 --> 01:29:19,395
I want my life back.

921
01:29:19,395 --> 01:29:20,980
My husband.

922
01:29:21,814 --> 01:29:22,774
My Bill!

923
01:29:22,940 --> 01:29:24,108
Jane.

924
01:29:28,821 --> 01:29:29,947
Don't.

925
01:29:31,991 --> 01:29:33,284
He's gonna hang.

926
01:29:34,118 --> 01:29:35,328
I'll make certain.

927
01:29:36,329 --> 01:29:37,789
What difference does it make?

928
01:29:38,414 --> 01:29:41,334
It matters to me.
You're better than him.

929
01:30:09,987 --> 01:30:11,489
Did you know it was empty?

930
01:30:28,548 --> 01:30:30,550
You make certain
he pays for Bill.

931
01:30:30,675 --> 01:30:33,386
'Cause if you don't,
I'll be coming back.

932
01:30:40,685 --> 01:30:42,228
There's room for one more.

933
01:30:42,895 --> 01:30:44,981
Bet we could use
somebody with grit.

934
01:30:45,731 --> 01:30:46,732
No thanks.

935
01:30:51,028 --> 01:30:52,572
So what you gonna do now,

936
01:30:53,531 --> 01:30:54,699
Calamity Jane?

937
01:30:54,824 --> 01:30:55,825
Ah, I think I'll try

938
01:30:55,825 --> 01:30:57,702
just being Jane for a while.

939
01:31:00,705 --> 01:31:02,874
This will make for one hell
of a story, won't it?

940
01:31:03,583 --> 01:31:06,836
I'll be on the lookout
for that book of yours.

941
01:31:06,836 --> 01:31:09,714
Well, I reckon it finally
has a proper hero.

942
01:31:38,451 --> 01:31:41,287
So you just let her
go like that?

943
01:31:42,788 --> 01:31:44,373
That really how it happened?

944
01:31:49,712 --> 01:31:50,630
Maybe.

945
01:31:51,297 --> 01:31:52,465
Maybe not.

946
01:31:54,592 --> 01:31:57,470
But it sure does make for one
hell of a story, doesn't it?

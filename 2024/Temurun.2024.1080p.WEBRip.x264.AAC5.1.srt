3
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:17,541
Gayatri, open the door!

4
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:27,750
Open it!

5
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:33,708
Gayatri!

6
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,750
<i>Come here, Gayatri.</i>

7
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:19,666
Ms. Gayatri put a lot of faith
in this search.

8
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,208
We don't have much time.

9
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,666
Not yet.

10
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,041
We're still at a dead end.

11
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,291
Ask her to be patient.

12
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,541
For how long?

13
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:33,833
We've been patient for 20 years now.

14
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:38,166
And all this must be
passed on immediately.

15
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:58,875
Dewi?

16
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:01,583
Dewi?

17
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,166
Mom.

18
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,833
Wi, here.

19
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:15,291
Here. You have to wear this all the time.

20
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,250
This is just some leaves, Mom.

21
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:22,916
- Look at me. I'm okay.
- No. It's dangerous.

22
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:24,750
Where's Sena?

23
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,083
Is he still not home? It's already late.

24
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:35,666
{\an8}VOTE DARMAJI FOR SUB-DISTRICT HEAD

{\an8}PROGRESS FOR KISAREJO
WE CAN DO IT WITH DARMAJI

26
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:05,541
<i>What do you want? I'm with my boss.</i>

27
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,041
Where are you taking him now?

28
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,541
Do you know what time it is?

29
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,708
Do I need to explain it to you again?

30
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:15,000
If you're not home by this hour,
Mom never shuts up about it.

31
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,166
I'm just tired.

32
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:21,208
I served people here and there for money.

33
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,791
And now I have to
face someone stubborn like you?

34
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,541
<i>Can you just shut up?</i>

35
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,000
<i>I'm tired too!</i>

36
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:31,583
<i>I'm also working</i>
<i>an extra job for you and Mom.</i>

37
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,666
<i>Can't you even be grateful?</i>

38
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,000
What extra job?

39
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,333
Your boss is a stingy man.

40
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:46,666
What's wrong, Mom?

41
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,916
- This is dangerous.
- What is it?

42
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:53,000
They're trying to separate us.
We have to find a way.

43
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:55,625
Nobody can separate us, Mom.

44
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,541
This is dangerous, Dewi.

45
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,500
We're safe, Mom. I'm here.

46
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:02,208
Because you can't see
whoever's coming. You can't see it!

47
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:05,000
You say it all the time,
but nothing has happened, right?

48
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:10,416
- But…
- We are safe. I got you. Come here, Mom.

49
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,958
Just breathe. I'm here.

50
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:22,666
Let's go to your room
and take your medicine, okay?

51
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,708
Sorry, ma'am, but did you record that?

52
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:36,625
No.

53
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,333
This is just another video.

54
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,625
Sena.

55
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,541
Here, for earlier.

56
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:01,958
Don't forget to wash the car
after what we did earlier.

57
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:05,000
Remember how last time
Mr. Darmaji almost found out about us?

58
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,416
Sorry, ma'am.

59
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,083
Mom?

60
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,583
Mom?

61
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,375
Mom.

62
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:45,375
Come on.

63
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,208
Mom.

64
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,333
What are you doing, Mom?

65
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:09,250
Mom?

66
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Mom.

67
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,833
- Dewi…
- Mom.

68
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:24,875
Mom…

69
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,791
Mom…

70
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:29,875
What are you doing, Mom?

71
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,833
What is that in your mouth?

72
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,958
Mom, that's just jujube leaves, not food.

73
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:41,333
- This is the only way.
- There is no one here.

74
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:42,916
No one is coming, Mom.

75
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,458
Nobody's there. I was just inside.

76
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,375
Go back to your room, okay?

77
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:57,041
Come on.

78
00:08:57,125 --> 00:09:02,166
It's just me.

79
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:03,833
Okay?

80
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,541
Come on.

81
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:07,916
Sit down.

82
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,083
Oh, you're back already?

83
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:30,875
I had to do overtime.

84
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,791
You should have let me know.

85
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:36,583
I bought you a phone
so I could call you when I'm with Mom.

86
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:38,791
She's having another episode.

87
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,958
And I had to calm her by myself.

88
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,541
Where is she now?

89
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,500
She's asleep.

90
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:52,500
Really?

91
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,291
Should I wake her up?

92
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,250
So what should I do?

93
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,166
Give me the bike key.

94
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:00,458
I need to use it.

95
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:04,916
What now?

96
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,416
It's out of gas.

97
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,625
You asshole.

98
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:14,250
Oh, and I haven't paid
this month's installment.

99
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,500
Can you pay it?

100
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:18,541
Are we installing it right away?

101
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,291
Go and check inside, let me prepare it.

102
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,708
Ouch.

103
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:29,166
SUB-DISTRICT OFFICE

104
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,041
- Morning, miss.
- Morning, Ms. Dewi.

105
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,750
I'm from Best Net, can we set up now?

106
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,208
I'm really sorry, Ms. Dewi,

107
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,208
but the boss changed his mind.

108
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,458
What happened?

109
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,125
He asked for another provider.

110
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:49,666
But this is too sudden.

111
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,708
I don't know about that.

112
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:52,750
Bara.

113
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:59,291
Make sure that my work is not interrupted
because of bad internet service.

114
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,708
Yes, sir.

115
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:04,250
Tari, have you let them know
that we're switching providers?

116
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,166
Yes, sir.

117
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,041
Excuse me, miss.

118
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,666
DARMAJI'S TEN WORK PROGRAM

119
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,583
You're Sena's friend, aren't you?

120
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,750
Used to be.

121
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,250
Some asshole your boss is.

122
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,208
- Canceling at the last minute like this.
- "Asshole"?

123
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,250
Like your brother, then?

124
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:26,958
Hello.

125
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,208
Okay, got it.

126
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,291
Where's your brother?

127
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,416
Where is he?

128
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,500
Listen.

129
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,708
I have been waiting for this.

130
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:44,416
Because he needs to pay for his sins.

131
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,916
I don't know…

132
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:52,958
- Where is he?
- I don't know!

133
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,291
- You son of a bitch!
- Quiet!

134
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,541
Shut up.

135
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:06,666
Shut up!

136
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,333
Mom!

137
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,083
What do you want?

138
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:14,291
Bastard!

139
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:18,958
Mom!

140
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,333
Yes, boss?

141
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:43,916
We only found his sister and mother.

142
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,791
<i>- Get rid of them.</i>
- Yes, boss.

143
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:00,875
Where is Sena?

144
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:06,166
Mom!

145
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,583
Your son is an idiot, you know that?

146
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,791
He slept with another man's wife!

147
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:23,875
Mom!

148
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,250
Let's get out of here!

149
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,250
You son of a bitch!

150
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,333
We finally found Ms. Diah.

151
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:16,083
DEAD BODY OF A MURDER VICTIM
FOUND IN HER HOME AT KEBUN KARANG

152
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,208
Does Ms. Gayatri know about this?

153
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:22,583
She does.

154
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,958
And I've texted you the address.

155
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,250
Alright.

156
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,916
Everyone, stay out!

157
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,000
We're leaving.

158
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,458
What did you do this time?

159
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,375
Answer me.

160
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,333
They came here…

161
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,500
neither for me…

162
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,750
nor Mom.

163
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,750
But you.

164
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,166
They were looking for you.

165
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,541
They said it was because of your sins.

166
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,000
And Mom had to die for that.

167
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,333
You did this to her.

168
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,125
Dewi…

169
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,666
You're tired. You're talking gibberish.

170
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,916
Dewi!

171
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:50,291
I know about your friend
from the sub-district office.

172
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:58,250
I'm begging you,

173
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:05,083
please explain to me what's going on

174
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,250
before I hear from someone else

175
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,291
about what you did.

176
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,666
I don't know.

177
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,000
Answer me.

178
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,083
I know you know it.

179
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,833
- Tell me!
- Dewi, please.

180
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:32,875
- Just answer me!
- I said, I don't know!

181
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:10,708
Are you done?

182
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,416
Are you happy now?

183
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:20,375
- Hey!
- This idiot can't even pay for his bike.

184
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,000
You asshole!

185
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,708
Next time, pay your installment!

186
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,125
Dewi.

187
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,208
- Dana…
- Sena.

188
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,375
What are you doing here?

189
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,291
I want to apologize.

190
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,125
For what?

191
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:16,375
I want to apologize
for leaving you and your mother.

192
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,333
I want

193
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,833
you to come with me.

194
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,375
You waited until Mom was dead.

195
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,000
- Then you finally come for us… What?
- Dewi.

196
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,375
- Are you defending him?
- I'm not defending him.

197
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:31,458
Then go with him.

198
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,166
You don't have to ask me.

199
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,208
Can you live alone?

200
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,791
All this time,
I've been taking care of Mom alone.

201
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:40,541
You weren't there.

202
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:42,958
Never mind this man.

203
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,333
It was just me.

204
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:52,666
I never intended to
leave you and your mother.

205
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,416
Dewi.

206
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:57,375
Dewi.

207
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,041
Why now?

208
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:21,208
If you two come with me,

209
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:27,833
there's one big thing
that we can fix together.

210
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:33,750
Who killed her?

211
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,208
Sen?

212
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,958
What are you doing?

213
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:03,500
Sena?

214
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:10,291
Sen?

215
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,208
Sen?

216
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:07,291
Dewi, help me.

217
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,333
Dewi?

218
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:13,791
Help me!

219
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:17,666
Mom?

220
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,291
Dewi, it's me.

221
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,791
What's wrong?

222
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,083
I saw Mom.

223
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:26,000
No, Mom is not here.

224
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:29,333
She's not here. It's just me.

225
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:33,166
It's just me.

226
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,666
Take a deep breath.

227
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:45,291
Dewi.

228
00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:48,458
I understand

229
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,666
that you're disappointed in Dad.

230
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:55,625
But you have to leave this place.

231
00:24:56,416 --> 00:24:57,625
Look at this.

232
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:03,125
There's only trauma, and sadness.

233
00:25:06,541 --> 00:25:08,125
Can you guarantee anything?

234
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:11,250
Whatever it is,
it's better than being here.

235
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:05,541
Esti. This is Dewi.

236
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,166
And this is Sena,
you've met before, right?

237
00:27:09,958 --> 00:27:11,583
Welcome back, Sena.

238
00:27:12,416 --> 00:27:13,916
Dewi.

239
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,208
She'll take care of your needs here.

240
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:20,041
Just bring your stuff.

241
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:23,333
She will show you the room.

242
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:25,000
Right. Come on.

243
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,958
Dewi, Sena.

244
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:31,708
Come with me, please.

245
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:20,625
Dewi. This is Ms. Gayatri.

246
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:29,375
Grandma.

247
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:35,208
You've grown up, Sena.

248
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:36,666
Yes, Grandma.

249
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:07,166
Esti, take them to their rooms.

250
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:09,166
Yes, ma'am.

251
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,375
Please.

252
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:32,500
Those are pictures of
the heads of the family.

253
00:29:33,791 --> 00:29:36,791
They are your ancestors.

254
00:29:38,708 --> 00:29:41,875
It has become a tradition in our family

255
00:29:41,958 --> 00:29:44,875
that the company leadership

256
00:29:44,958 --> 00:29:49,541
is carried out and passed down
from woman to woman.

257
00:29:49,625 --> 00:29:50,583
And finally,

258
00:29:50,666 --> 00:29:54,541
the family line is also led by

259
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:56,416
us, the women.

260
00:29:57,541 --> 00:29:59,458
And I really hope

261
00:29:59,541 --> 00:30:03,000
that you can replace me
as the company leader

262
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:06,416
and carry on the family line

263
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:10,041
that has been built by your ancestors.

264
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:25,833
Can I eat this right away?

265
00:30:25,916 --> 00:30:27,250
Yes, you can, Sena.

266
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:28,416
Go ahead.

267
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:34,708
What have you been up to all this time?

268
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,416
Just working odd jobs, Grandma.

269
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,791
As long as I make money.

270
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:41,666
What do you mean by odd jobs?

271
00:30:42,791 --> 00:30:45,000
Breeding chickens,
and selling them to the market.

272
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:46,458
Selling bootleg DVDs.

273
00:30:46,541 --> 00:30:47,375
Swallow it first.

274
00:30:48,958 --> 00:30:50,208
Swallow your food first.

275
00:30:50,916 --> 00:30:52,083
Sorry.

276
00:30:53,791 --> 00:30:56,583
Sena used to be a private driver.

277
00:30:57,916 --> 00:30:59,625
And Dewi

278
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:02,916
is an internet technician.

279
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,166
That's great.

280
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:08,375
You're not eating?

281
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,333
No, honey.

282
00:31:10,916 --> 00:31:13,166
You can eat as much as you want.

283
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:16,250
Tomorrow you're going to learn

284
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:19,458
everything about our family business.

285
00:32:54,916 --> 00:32:56,583
What are you doing here?

286
00:32:57,625 --> 00:32:58,625
Sorry,

287
00:32:58,708 --> 00:33:00,708
I thought it was the bathroom.

288
00:33:00,791 --> 00:33:02,083
Not anymore.

289
00:33:02,166 --> 00:33:05,000
No one is allowed to enter this room.

290
00:33:05,666 --> 00:33:07,000
The bathroom is over there.

291
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:18,250
Dewi.

292
00:33:34,166 --> 00:33:36,958
<i>Dewi…</i>

293
00:35:21,541 --> 00:35:23,666
You're here already.

294
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:24,875
Yes, Mother.

295
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:33,458
Three generations of
our family have made a living

296
00:35:33,541 --> 00:35:35,291
from meat processing.

297
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,541
I brought you here with one purpose

298
00:35:42,291 --> 00:35:44,041
so that you can learn.

299
00:35:47,916 --> 00:35:52,166
Because all of this
will be yours to manage in the future.

300
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,750
- Dewi?
- Let me go after her.

301
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:20,458
It's alright.

302
00:36:33,916 --> 00:36:36,125
I'm sorry, Grandma.

303
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:40,500
- I will take care of it.
- That's okay.

304
00:36:42,666 --> 00:36:45,458
I've heard what happened to your mother.

305
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,666
I understand how you feel.

306
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:50,083
Remember.

307
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:54,333
No matter how bad your experience is

308
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:59,083
you must realize that it has passed.

309
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:04,041
And now it's time for you

310
00:37:04,833 --> 00:37:06,208
to live your future.

311
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,833
And your future is here.

312
00:37:09,458 --> 00:37:11,208
And I'm here too.

313
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:15,541
I will make sure that whatever you want,

314
00:37:16,125 --> 00:37:18,041
I will make happen.

315
00:37:20,666 --> 00:37:21,500
Like this?

316
00:37:21,583 --> 00:37:23,708
- That's good.
- Right?

317
00:37:23,791 --> 00:37:24,750
By the way, Dad.

318
00:37:24,833 --> 00:37:28,791
I accidentally found a room
filled with old kinds of stuff yesterday.

319
00:37:28,875 --> 00:37:29,875
What was that?

320
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:34,083
You went into your Grandma's private room?

321
00:37:34,166 --> 00:37:36,250
Well, it wasn't on purpose.

322
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:38,125
I thought it was the bathroom.

323
00:37:38,208 --> 00:37:40,833
Because I remember it was
the bathroom when I was little.

324
00:37:40,916 --> 00:37:45,041
And inside, there were photos,
but the males are all crossed out.

325
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:46,083
What's with that?

326
00:37:47,625 --> 00:37:48,458
Good afternoon, Mr. Agung.

327
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:53,750
- Where were you, Jaka?
- I'm from the office.

328
00:37:53,833 --> 00:37:55,875
Let me introduce you. This is Sena.

329
00:37:56,458 --> 00:37:57,541
This is Jaka.

330
00:37:58,541 --> 00:38:00,625
- Hello, sir. Jaka.
- Hi.

331
00:38:02,208 --> 00:38:03,958
He's a friend of mine.

332
00:38:05,541 --> 00:38:07,583
I consider him like a son.

333
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:09,250
You don't have to say that.

334
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,375
I have to go now.
I have to meet Mr. Darsono.

335
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,250
- Okay.
- See you later.

336
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:16,500
Excuse me, Sena.

337
00:38:16,583 --> 00:38:18,583
- Good morning, everyone.
- Thank you, sir.

338
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:21,083
Good morning, ma'am.

339
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,416
Dewi.

340
00:38:24,041 --> 00:38:27,166
This is Jaka, our head of administration.

341
00:38:27,833 --> 00:38:29,875
Jaka. My granddaughter, Dewi.

342
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,833
Teach her everything.

343
00:38:32,916 --> 00:38:34,041
Yes, ma'am.

344
00:38:39,625 --> 00:38:40,791
Please, sit down.

345
00:38:41,958 --> 00:38:43,541
Thank you, Mr. Jaka.

346
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:45,208
Just call me Jaka.

347
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:49,583
This is the company profile.

348
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:53,916
And here's the financial report
and the administration's SOP.

349
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,458
Let me explain our financial report first.

350
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:03,708
Here you can see
that from 2000, the numbers are good.

351
00:39:03,791 --> 00:39:07,416
Up to 2003, 2008, and even 2013.

352
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,291
But in 2017

353
00:39:11,375 --> 00:39:14,250
our income dropped drastically again.

354
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:15,500
Until now.

355
00:39:17,083 --> 00:39:18,875
What was the reason?

356
00:39:18,958 --> 00:39:22,166
That year, many of our cows
started to get sick.

357
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,541
I don't know why.

358
00:39:23,625 --> 00:39:27,416
Next, you can see our company profile.

359
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,666
Please read it.

360
00:39:31,125 --> 00:39:32,708
Are you sure this isn't a misprint?

361
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:38,250
"Ms. Gayatri Desari
has run the business since 1935."

362
00:39:39,958 --> 00:39:42,625
No. It's really like that.

363
00:39:45,625 --> 00:39:48,083
Ms. Esti, we heard some strange news.

364
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:51,500
Suddenly, the adult cows
have been recovering.

365
00:39:52,416 --> 00:39:54,333
Their vitality is stabilizing

366
00:39:54,416 --> 00:39:56,833
and their blood pressure is
starting to drop.

367
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,916
- Okay.
- Yes, ma'am.

368
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:22,416
So what should I do now, Esti?

369
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:27,333
Even though they're both back

370
00:40:27,416 --> 00:40:29,500
and the slaughterhouse
is in a better state,

371
00:40:29,583 --> 00:40:32,083
their arrival is making you sick.

372
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:36,083
I understand that they just arrived.

373
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,291
But we have to speed up the inheritance.

374
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:41,333
No.

375
00:40:41,416 --> 00:40:43,750
We have to give them time.

376
00:40:47,375 --> 00:40:48,541
Who's that?

377
00:41:09,208 --> 00:41:11,375
SEARCH

378
00:41:11,458 --> 00:41:13,791
RATU SUBUR ABADI SLAUGHTERHOUSE

379
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:15,500
NO SEARCH RESULTS FOUND

380
00:41:15,583 --> 00:41:17,958
END OF SEARCH

381
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:29,750
You idiot.

382
00:41:30,958 --> 00:41:33,041
- Knock first.
- Sorry.

383
00:41:34,833 --> 00:41:36,541
Do you know that Grandma is sick?

384
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:37,833
Sick of what?

385
00:41:37,916 --> 00:41:39,500
I don't know, but

386
00:41:39,583 --> 00:41:44,833
I heard she and Esti talking
about her being sick and in pain.

387
00:41:45,458 --> 00:41:46,625
What's wrong with her?

388
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:48,458
Well, she's an old lady.

389
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:52,208
But she sounded very angry.

390
00:41:52,291 --> 00:41:53,791
She was angry at something?

391
00:41:54,416 --> 00:41:56,250
Who else talks like that?
Of course it was her.

392
00:41:57,916 --> 00:41:58,916
And then?

393
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,625
Then I heard them talking about

394
00:42:02,708 --> 00:42:04,875
an inheritance
that needs to be passed down soon.

395
00:42:04,958 --> 00:42:07,666
It's normal for old people
to talk about inheritance.

396
00:42:11,041 --> 00:42:12,125
You're right.

397
00:42:12,208 --> 00:42:13,708
You don't make any sense.

398
00:42:15,041 --> 00:42:16,083
Now get out.

399
00:42:34,833 --> 00:42:37,833
- These are the leaves you're looking for.
- Thank you.

400
00:42:41,916 --> 00:42:45,583
- The room key…
- I'll let you know, okay?

401
00:43:56,916 --> 00:43:57,833
What are you doing?

402
00:44:06,958 --> 00:44:09,041
I'm making myself a cup of tea, Esti.

403
00:44:09,625 --> 00:44:14,375
I've told you if you need anything,
you can call me.

404
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:22,416
Thank you.

405
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:28,083
I need to ask you something.

406
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:32,916
I read about the company's history.

407
00:44:33,916 --> 00:44:35,625
It says that Grandma

408
00:44:36,458 --> 00:44:40,291
has run the company since 1935.

409
00:44:41,458 --> 00:44:43,333
Are you sure they didn't make a mistake?

410
00:44:44,791 --> 00:44:46,125
That means

411
00:44:47,333 --> 00:44:48,708
she's about 100 years old.

412
00:44:48,791 --> 00:44:50,416
Who told you that, Ms. Dewi?

413
00:44:53,541 --> 00:44:54,791
Jaka.

414
00:44:55,541 --> 00:44:58,791
I was put in charge of
the administration with Jaka.

415
00:45:00,125 --> 00:45:02,291
Grandma ordered him to do it.

416
00:45:05,375 --> 00:45:06,750
All you need to know is that

417
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:12,083
a lot of people in the company are jealous

418
00:45:12,166 --> 00:45:14,083
of Ms. Gayatri and Mr. Agung's success.

419
00:45:16,041 --> 00:45:17,916
That's why I told you,

420
00:45:18,583 --> 00:45:21,125
if you have a question or anything

421
00:45:21,708 --> 00:45:23,833
just ask Ms. Gayatri.

422
00:45:24,958 --> 00:45:26,125
Not anyone else.

423
00:45:28,041 --> 00:45:29,750
I need to talk about Ms. Dewi.

424
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:34,875
I told you last night
to give her some time.

425
00:45:35,625 --> 00:45:36,958
We don't have time anymore, ma'am.

426
00:45:37,625 --> 00:45:40,791
We've been waiting for
20 years, and we can't fail.

427
00:45:41,625 --> 00:45:45,708
And it looks like Mr. Agung
and Jaka are working on their plans.

428
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:48,083
Give me two days.

429
00:45:49,166 --> 00:45:50,250
Yes, ma'am.

430
00:45:56,708 --> 00:45:57,958
How long have you been here?

431
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:01,000
About five years, sir.

432
00:46:02,291 --> 00:46:03,583
Five years.

433
00:46:03,666 --> 00:46:04,541
That's quite a long time.

434
00:46:06,583 --> 00:46:10,375
So you know a lot about this business.

435
00:46:10,458 --> 00:46:12,583
And you're pretty close to my family.

436
00:46:12,666 --> 00:46:14,541
You even came to
our home during the night.

437
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Yeah, pretty much, sir.

438
00:46:21,083 --> 00:46:24,250
As Mr. Agung said,
I'm pretty close with him.

439
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:29,291
That's why I also know
that you just met Mr. Agung

440
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:31,250
after he left you
at the age of seven, right?

441
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:35,500
What do you mean by that?

442
00:46:38,916 --> 00:46:40,250
Nothing, sir.

443
00:46:40,958 --> 00:46:43,500
I just think that I owe Mr. Agung.

444
00:46:44,916 --> 00:46:47,666
My father used to work here

445
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:49,625
then he got into an accident and died.

446
00:46:49,708 --> 00:46:51,708
Since then, I have been…

447
00:47:00,458 --> 00:47:01,750
A day off, finally.

448
00:47:03,541 --> 00:47:04,708
A day off?

449
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:07,333
What are you talking about?

450
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:10,791
They told us to have a day off. They said,
Ms. Gayatri had an event with her family.

451
00:47:11,375 --> 00:47:13,375
Maybe to celebrate
her grandchildren's visit.

452
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:20,416
Hello, sir.

453
00:47:22,208 --> 00:47:23,625
They're moving ahead, sir.

454
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:26,416
Yes, I'm sure.

455
00:47:27,875 --> 00:47:30,458
I just got the news
that we're going to have a day off.

456
00:47:33,333 --> 00:47:34,250
Yes, sir.

457
00:47:36,375 --> 00:47:37,541
Sena.

458
00:47:38,125 --> 00:47:39,291
Hey.

459
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:42,791
You drive. Okay?

460
00:47:42,875 --> 00:47:44,000
Can you do it?

461
00:47:44,083 --> 00:47:46,166
I'm a driver, Dad.

462
00:47:47,416 --> 00:47:48,583
Right.

463
00:47:51,208 --> 00:47:53,750
Don't forget to pick up your stuff
in the trunk tomorrow.

464
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:56,541
Why not now?

465
00:47:57,125 --> 00:47:59,291
Just do it tomorrow. Okay?

466
00:48:01,125 --> 00:48:03,125
I want you to promise me one thing.

467
00:48:04,208 --> 00:48:07,791
And I want you to keep that promise.

468
00:48:10,416 --> 00:48:11,458
What is it?

469
00:48:28,791 --> 00:48:30,416
You said she was in pain.

470
00:48:32,458 --> 00:48:33,875
How should I know?

471
00:48:33,958 --> 00:48:35,125
That's what I heard.

472
00:48:35,708 --> 00:48:37,291
Are you two talking about me?

473
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:40,458
- No?
- Yes, he said…

474
00:48:40,541 --> 00:48:42,583
So is it yes or no?

475
00:49:33,208 --> 00:49:34,333
Esti.

476
00:49:35,958 --> 00:49:38,291
Sorry if I keep surprising you, Ms. Dewi.

477
00:49:39,083 --> 00:49:41,375
If you're done,
please go straight to madam's room.

478
00:49:41,458 --> 00:49:44,083
She needs to tell you something.

479
00:49:53,625 --> 00:49:54,791
Come in, dear.

480
00:49:56,041 --> 00:49:57,208
Come in.

481
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:10,958
I hear from Esti
that you like to listen to music.

482
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:12,208
Correct?

483
00:50:15,125 --> 00:50:16,416
These are yours?

484
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,750
Yes.

485
00:50:17,833 --> 00:50:22,166
I've been collecting them
for almost 30 years.

486
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:25,958
Vinyl. Cassette tapes.

487
00:50:26,041 --> 00:50:27,958
Your father also loves them.

488
00:50:28,875 --> 00:50:32,833
But lately, he's not into it anymore.

489
00:50:32,916 --> 00:50:37,541
Because he said I have too many records.

490
00:50:37,625 --> 00:50:39,416
He gets overwhelmed when he sees them.

491
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:44,041
"If you don't want to listen to them,

492
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:48,000
just put all the records in the closet."

493
00:50:48,083 --> 00:50:50,250
That's what he said.

494
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:01,458
Esti.

495
00:51:04,375 --> 00:51:05,708
Beat me this time.

496
00:51:22,875 --> 00:51:24,916
Are you listening to Iga Susanti too?

497
00:51:27,708 --> 00:51:30,375
"Morning and Night Together."

498
00:51:31,583 --> 00:51:33,833
This is one of my favorite albums.

499
00:51:34,875 --> 00:51:36,041
Really?

500
00:51:36,541 --> 00:51:38,125
I also like this album.

501
00:51:38,791 --> 00:51:41,791
I have the tape version, it was Mom's.

502
00:51:42,291 --> 00:51:43,458
I know.

503
00:51:44,041 --> 00:51:49,541
That's the tape player
that you like to use before bed, right?

504
00:51:50,708 --> 00:51:51,833
How do you know?

505
00:51:53,375 --> 00:51:57,333
I bought the tape player for your mother.

506
00:51:58,541 --> 00:52:02,958
Your mother liked to
spend her time with me.

507
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:08,375
Because I used to be sad and lonely
when I didn't have anyone to accompany me.

508
00:52:11,583 --> 00:52:15,291
I miss my mother.

509
00:52:18,916 --> 00:52:20,958
For some people

510
00:52:22,125 --> 00:52:26,333
death is a mere passing.

511
00:52:27,833 --> 00:52:29,708
Not a separation.

512
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:36,291
But if we want to meet with those

513
00:52:37,083 --> 00:52:39,791
who are no longer with us,

514
00:52:40,916 --> 00:52:45,916
I think you need a struggle to get there.

515
00:52:47,666 --> 00:52:48,833
Don't you think so?

516
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:54,583
What do you mean?

517
00:52:57,791 --> 00:52:59,333
No.

518
00:53:00,375 --> 00:53:04,125
I just think too much sometimes.

519
00:53:05,583 --> 00:53:06,708
In short,

520
00:53:07,708 --> 00:53:12,000
your mother and I had a lot in common.

521
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:15,916
Especially in our taste of music.

522
00:53:30,625 --> 00:53:32,375
Let's dance.

523
00:53:32,458 --> 00:53:35,375
- I can't dance.
- It's easy.

524
00:53:35,458 --> 00:53:38,041
I will teach you. It's easy.

525
00:53:38,125 --> 00:53:40,000
Like this. Move this foot forward.

526
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:41,791
- Forward.
- Forward.

527
00:53:41,875 --> 00:53:43,041
To the side.

528
00:53:43,958 --> 00:53:45,208
Back.

529
00:53:47,541 --> 00:53:48,833
Forward.

530
00:53:49,583 --> 00:53:50,750
Do you get that?

531
00:53:59,541 --> 00:54:00,708
You're good at it now!

532
00:54:00,791 --> 00:54:03,375
It's easy, right? I know you could do it.

533
00:54:27,708 --> 00:54:28,958
What's your big plan?

534
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:41,708
I'm just taking care of my master.

535
00:54:44,083 --> 00:54:47,791
And if your plan fails?

536
00:55:13,875 --> 00:55:14,958
Hey!

537
00:55:18,625 --> 00:55:19,791
Stop!

538
00:55:22,125 --> 00:55:23,041
Hey!

539
00:55:28,375 --> 00:55:30,166
I let you win all this time.

540
00:55:32,458 --> 00:55:33,458
But not now.

541
00:55:35,041 --> 00:55:36,208
This time,

542
00:55:39,791 --> 00:55:40,875
you're the one who failed.

543
00:55:54,416 --> 00:55:56,000
Forward. Step.

544
00:55:56,083 --> 00:55:58,166
Back. Step.

545
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:00,125
Back. Step.

546
00:56:00,208 --> 00:56:01,458
Forward. Step.

547
00:56:01,541 --> 00:56:02,875
You can do it, right?

548
00:56:02,958 --> 00:56:04,625
Of course you can.

549
00:56:26,125 --> 00:56:27,875
Grandma?

550
00:56:29,458 --> 00:56:30,458
Grandma?

551
00:56:31,458 --> 00:56:34,291
Esti!

552
00:56:39,916 --> 00:56:41,500
We got a burglar, Dad.

553
00:56:42,041 --> 00:56:43,750
- A burglar?
- He's out in front. Let's go.

554
00:56:44,458 --> 00:56:46,791
I heard a voice in that room.

555
00:56:46,875 --> 00:56:48,583
And then the burglar
ran towards the front gate.

556
00:56:48,666 --> 00:56:50,000
But now he's gone.

557
00:56:50,875 --> 00:56:52,041
Come on!

558
00:56:52,708 --> 00:56:54,250
Just go back and rest.

559
00:56:56,833 --> 00:56:58,000
What about the burglar?

560
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:00,541
We're not going to do anything about it?

561
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:05,375
I think you better rest for now.

562
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:06,875
Okay?

563
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
What's wrong with her?

564
00:57:18,791 --> 00:57:20,041
I don't know.

565
00:57:20,125 --> 00:57:22,166
She was teaching me.

566
00:57:22,791 --> 00:57:25,458
She was teaching me
how to dance and then she fell.

567
00:57:27,041 --> 00:57:29,166
She has chronic anemia.

568
00:57:29,916 --> 00:57:31,375
She mustn't do heavy activities.

569
00:57:32,083 --> 00:57:33,583
Including dancing.

570
00:57:36,416 --> 00:57:38,208
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

571
00:57:38,291 --> 00:57:39,958
Now you know.

572
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:47,125
And there are still many things you need
to know about Ms. Gayatri and the company.

573
00:57:47,916 --> 00:57:49,500
If something happens to her,

574
00:57:50,875 --> 00:57:52,625
you will inherit everything.

575
00:57:54,666 --> 00:57:57,166
And whether you want it or not,
you have to be ready.

576
00:58:00,541 --> 00:58:01,375
Please.

577
00:58:11,041 --> 00:58:12,125
Here it is, sir.

578
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,708
I'm still confused, sir.

579
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:15,916
Why now?

580
00:58:16,416 --> 00:58:20,000
Do you know what the condition
of our slaughterhouse was like

581
00:58:20,083 --> 00:58:22,208
before Sena and Dewi came?

582
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:24,791
Yes, I know.

583
00:58:24,875 --> 00:58:25,958
It was miserable.

584
00:58:26,041 --> 00:58:27,750
Many livestock were dead.

585
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:30,208
And after they came

586
00:58:30,791 --> 00:58:32,208
the livestock became healthy again.

587
00:58:33,333 --> 00:58:36,416
The demon in my mother's body has risen.

588
00:58:38,208 --> 00:58:40,541
And it's eating her from the inside.

589
00:58:42,208 --> 00:58:44,125
Trying to find a new host.

590
00:58:45,958 --> 00:58:48,708
And do you know who the new host is?

591
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:52,000
Oh, of course.

592
00:58:53,125 --> 00:58:57,708
This is the only thing that can
stop the demon from poisoning my family.

593
00:58:58,958 --> 00:59:01,583
My life will be better tomorrow, Jaka.

594
00:59:02,958 --> 00:59:03,958
Tomorrow,

595
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:07,625
meet me and Dana in the slaughterhouse.

596
00:59:07,708 --> 00:59:10,500
- Who is Dana?
- I mean Sena.

597
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:13,708
Yes, sir.

598
01:01:38,666 --> 01:01:39,833
Forgive me, Mother.

599
01:01:43,041 --> 01:01:45,333
I have to do this for my children.

600
01:02:38,375 --> 01:02:40,333
- Mr. Agung!
- Who did that?

601
01:02:40,416 --> 01:02:41,250
Oh my god!

602
01:02:41,333 --> 01:02:42,541
Who did this?

603
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:44,625
Let's ask Jaka.
He was here the whole time.

604
01:02:44,708 --> 01:02:46,166
- No… That was…
- Jaka.

605
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:48,625
- No, I just got here.
- What did you do?

606
01:02:48,708 --> 01:02:49,750
Jaka.

607
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:51,083
- I didn't do it!
- Help him down.

608
01:02:51,166 --> 01:02:52,875
- Get back here!
- Help him down.

609
01:02:52,958 --> 01:02:54,958
Stop, Jaka!

610
01:02:55,041 --> 01:02:57,916
- Get back here!
- Stop, Jaka!

611
01:03:11,083 --> 01:03:12,333
Dad!

612
01:03:12,833 --> 01:03:14,208
Dad!

613
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:17,125
Dad!

614
01:03:17,208 --> 01:03:18,375
Get me a ladder!

615
01:03:18,916 --> 01:03:20,541
Get me a ladder!

616
01:03:21,041 --> 01:03:23,291
Dad…

617
01:03:47,875 --> 01:03:49,041
Agung

618
01:03:51,041 --> 01:03:53,291
was never a perfect child.

619
01:03:56,291 --> 01:04:00,291
He wasn't a respected father either.

620
01:04:03,125 --> 01:04:04,750
But his intentions were always good.

621
01:04:07,083 --> 01:04:09,250
He always tried

622
01:04:09,333 --> 01:04:12,791
as much as possible
to carry everyone's burden.

623
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:15,250
Let's sit inside.

624
01:04:15,958 --> 01:04:17,458
But in the end

625
01:04:18,291 --> 01:04:21,875
the burden was too heavy
for him to carry alone.

626
01:04:23,875 --> 01:04:25,291
Even so,

627
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:29,541
you will always be remembered, my son.

628
01:04:50,083 --> 01:04:51,500
We have to get out of here.

629
01:04:55,083 --> 01:04:56,458
You're the one who wanted to come here.

630
01:04:57,125 --> 01:04:58,583
Why do you want to leave now?

631
01:04:58,666 --> 01:05:00,291
I can't explain it right now.

632
01:05:00,375 --> 01:05:01,208
But the point is,

633
01:05:02,041 --> 01:05:03,375
we have to leave.

634
01:05:05,166 --> 01:05:06,458
Sena.

635
01:05:06,541 --> 01:05:07,541
Sena!

636
01:05:08,416 --> 01:05:09,583
Sena!

637
01:05:09,666 --> 01:05:11,291
- Wait!
- What do you want?

638
01:05:13,708 --> 01:05:14,750
Sit down.

639
01:05:14,833 --> 01:05:16,250
Talk slowly.

640
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:19,041
I know you're upset now.

641
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:22,583
I know we just lost our father.

642
01:05:22,666 --> 01:05:25,291
I felt so miserable too
when we lost our mother

643
01:05:25,791 --> 01:05:27,250
that I went crazy.

644
01:05:27,333 --> 01:05:31,791
Don't you dare compare her to Dad, okay?

645
01:05:31,875 --> 01:05:33,125
Dad is a sane person.

646
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:35,583
Do you know what he said?

647
01:05:36,208 --> 01:05:38,458
"We have to take care of Dewi."

648
01:05:39,166 --> 01:05:40,833
So it's impossible that he killed himself.

649
01:05:41,541 --> 01:05:43,041
He wasn't crazy like Mom.

650
01:05:43,125 --> 01:05:44,416
Watch your mouth!

651
01:05:46,125 --> 01:05:47,250
You asshole.

652
01:05:48,083 --> 01:05:50,458
If he were a sane person,
he would be here to take care of us.

653
01:05:50,541 --> 01:05:52,041
Where was he?

654
01:05:52,125 --> 01:05:53,750
Mom went insane because of Dad.

655
01:05:53,833 --> 01:05:55,583
- Dad was never there.
- It's all because of you!

656
01:05:56,625 --> 01:05:58,666
Mom lost her mind because of you!

657
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:00,708
They were separated because of you!

658
01:06:01,375 --> 01:06:02,625
My life was happy for seven years.

659
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:04,375
And then you came and changed everything!

660
01:06:04,458 --> 01:06:06,666
So that's your excuse?
You were never there for us.

661
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:08,916
I had to be responsible for everything!

662
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,625
I almost went crazy because of Mom!

663
01:06:11,708 --> 01:06:13,583
Because you were
never there, just like Dad!

664
01:06:13,666 --> 01:06:16,916
You always ran away from us!

665
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,333
Don't forget that Mom died because of you!

666
01:06:19,416 --> 01:06:20,916
And Dad must've died because of you too.

667
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,291
It's all because of you! Don't you--

668
01:06:29,708 --> 01:06:30,666
Go to hell!

669
01:06:44,666 --> 01:06:45,833
Sena.

670
01:06:48,166 --> 01:06:50,458
I know you're both uncomfortable.

671
01:06:51,416 --> 01:06:53,000
But Mr. Agung

672
01:06:54,291 --> 01:06:55,750
helped me a lot.

673
01:06:56,875 --> 01:07:00,583
I owe him a lot
because Mr. Agung helped me to work here.

674
01:07:01,458 --> 01:07:04,083
Now I can't repay his kindness.

675
01:07:11,791 --> 01:07:13,000
Jaka did this, sir.

676
01:07:15,041 --> 01:07:17,791
I hope this helps you to get closure.

677
01:07:19,375 --> 01:07:20,541
Excuse me.

678
01:07:33,708 --> 01:07:36,541
SENA, MEET ME AT THE COWSHED TONIGHT

679
01:07:36,625 --> 01:07:38,625
PLEASE COME ALONE… THANK YOU

680
01:07:55,458 --> 01:07:56,625
Dewi.

681
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:25,916
Mom.

682
01:08:32,375 --> 01:08:34,625
I miss you.

683
01:08:36,291 --> 01:08:37,875
I'm sorry.

684
01:08:38,708 --> 01:08:41,333
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.

685
01:08:42,958 --> 01:08:45,791
I couldn't do anything.

686
01:08:47,541 --> 01:08:48,875
Calm down, Dewi.

687
01:08:50,375 --> 01:08:52,375
I'm always here for you.

688
01:08:56,166 --> 01:08:58,041
I need you here, Mom.

689
01:09:00,041 --> 01:09:01,916
You have to listen to me, okay?

690
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:10,375
Yes, Mom. Anything.

691
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:16,250
I will do anything for you.

692
01:09:18,875 --> 01:09:20,958
But please stay with me.

693
01:09:21,875 --> 01:09:24,250
Don't leave me again.

694
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:29,458
I'm so lonely without you.

695
01:09:51,125 --> 01:09:52,708
You're here alone, right?

696
01:09:55,041 --> 01:09:56,208
Sena.

697
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:58,250
I know what happened to my father.

698
01:09:58,333 --> 01:09:59,916
It's hard for me to accept.

699
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,708
But I can explain everything
that happened to your father.

700
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:05,666
Sena.

701
01:10:06,708 --> 01:10:07,875
Calm down.

702
01:10:07,958 --> 01:10:09,166
Why did you kill my father?

703
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:11,333
Kill him?

704
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:15,166
- I can explain everything.
- Was it money?

705
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:17,041
Sena…

706
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:19,125
Or power?

707
01:10:19,208 --> 01:10:22,333
No, I can explain everything.

708
01:10:22,416 --> 01:10:23,750
He was kind to you.

709
01:10:23,833 --> 01:10:26,750
They did all this because of Dewi.

710
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:34,666
Dewi?

711
01:10:35,333 --> 01:10:37,291
You're still awake?

712
01:10:40,583 --> 01:10:42,458
Sena, no!

713
01:11:13,541 --> 01:11:15,291
You're trying to get rid of me.

714
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,208
Dad is dead because of you!

715
01:11:23,375 --> 01:11:25,208
Dewi changed because of you!

716
01:11:25,291 --> 01:11:27,500
It's all because of you!

717
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:28,833
Dana!

718
01:11:30,041 --> 01:11:31,875
Open the trunk.

719
01:11:35,375 --> 01:11:37,333
The trunk…

720
01:12:24,208 --> 01:12:25,833
I think I'm going crazy.

721
01:12:28,583 --> 01:12:31,375
I miss my mom.

722
01:12:33,541 --> 01:12:35,958
She comes here a lot.

723
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:38,541
But then…

724
01:12:39,125 --> 01:12:41,000
she suddenly disappears.

725
01:12:41,791 --> 01:12:43,208
Sometimes she looks scary.

726
01:12:44,208 --> 01:12:45,208
But…

727
01:12:45,291 --> 01:12:46,750
Mom came earlier.

728
01:12:47,375 --> 01:12:49,041
And she was kind.

729
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:50,916
But…

730
01:12:51,625 --> 01:12:53,458
I'm here for you.

731
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,250
Lady Heras?

732
01:13:17,875 --> 01:13:20,000
THE PROPHET

733
01:13:20,083 --> 01:13:21,250
Esti?

734
01:13:25,333 --> 01:13:26,666
{\an8}INHERITANCE RITUAL

735
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:31,458
{\an8}I'll do anything for you.

736
01:13:35,833 --> 01:13:38,458
Do you want to meet your mom?

737
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:42,833
I do. I want to see my mom again.

738
01:13:43,666 --> 01:13:45,500
There's a way.

739
01:13:45,583 --> 01:13:48,416
But it's full of sacrifices.

740
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Whatever it is. No matter what.

741
01:13:52,083 --> 01:13:53,083
I will do it.

742
01:13:53,166 --> 01:13:54,000
Of course.

743
01:13:55,458 --> 01:13:56,625
Like this.

744
01:13:59,541 --> 01:14:01,333
Are you kidding?

745
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,208
Now you do it.

746
01:14:12,208 --> 01:14:13,625
Good.

747
01:14:13,708 --> 01:14:15,541
Incision in hand?

748
01:14:15,625 --> 01:14:17,125
A pact?

749
01:14:17,208 --> 01:14:19,875
<i>Jujube leaves for my wife and Dewi.</i>

750
01:14:19,958 --> 01:14:25,000
<i>Don't forget to always remind them to</i>
<i>take care of the bonsai that I gave you.</i>

751
01:14:25,083 --> 01:14:27,708
<i>The inheritance ceremony will be held</i>

752
01:14:27,791 --> 01:14:30,791
<i>when the female</i>
<i>offspring enters adolescence.</i>

753
01:14:31,541 --> 01:14:33,625
<i>The male child will be sacrificed.</i>

754
01:14:33,708 --> 01:14:36,583
<i>So I have to stop it by killing my mother.</i>

755
01:14:39,458 --> 01:14:40,833
Slowly.

756
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:47,583
Good.

757
01:14:47,666 --> 01:14:48,625
Let me take that.

758
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:52,083
Okay, now we do this.

759
01:14:53,416 --> 01:14:54,666
We unite our hands.

760
01:14:55,666 --> 01:14:59,000
And you'll meet your mother right away.

761
01:14:59,083 --> 01:15:01,375
She'll be here soon.

762
01:15:21,833 --> 01:15:23,958
Dewi.

763
01:15:24,041 --> 01:15:25,791
Dewi.

764
01:15:31,125 --> 01:15:32,291
Dewi.

765
01:15:36,041 --> 01:15:36,875
Dewi.

766
01:15:38,916 --> 01:15:40,166
- Sena.
- Dewi?

767
01:15:41,541 --> 01:15:42,958
Dewi?

768
01:15:43,041 --> 01:15:44,208
Sena?

769
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:48,083
Dewi! What happened?

770
01:16:03,583 --> 01:16:06,708
Come on. We have to get out of here.

771
01:16:06,791 --> 01:16:09,500
Why did Mom have to die?

772
01:16:09,583 --> 01:16:13,083
- Why did Dad have to die?
- Dewi, you're talking nonsense.

773
01:16:14,291 --> 01:16:15,916
- Why…
- Come on!

774
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,916
- Why did it have to be them?
- Dewi, please, stop it!

775
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,791
- Why Mom?
- Please, Dewi. Please.

776
01:16:22,875 --> 01:16:25,458
Why didn't you die?

777
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:59,750
You gave me your promise, Dewi.

778
01:17:01,125 --> 01:17:02,541
Now it's time to go home.

779
01:17:05,166 --> 01:17:07,458
Soon you will meet her.

780
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:10,250
Mom?

781
01:17:11,416 --> 01:17:12,583
Mom?

782
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:14,666
Mom?

783
01:18:44,833 --> 01:18:47,000
We are not worthy

784
01:18:47,083 --> 01:18:49,250
of being protected forever.

785
01:18:50,250 --> 01:18:52,750
We are nothing but a mere burden.

786
01:18:55,375 --> 01:18:57,166
We are just a vessel

787
01:18:59,208 --> 01:19:00,916
for the sacrifice.

788
01:19:01,875 --> 01:19:03,333
For the glory.

789
01:19:05,125 --> 01:19:07,208
That is worthy of all souls.

790
01:19:10,083 --> 01:19:12,500
I am just a burden.

791
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:17,333
In time becomes eternal.

792
01:19:17,416 --> 01:19:20,208
Heras is the immortal.

793
01:19:21,458 --> 01:19:23,833
Universe bliss.

794
01:19:23,916 --> 01:19:25,333
Everlasting.

795
01:19:51,791 --> 01:19:52,958
Mom.

796
01:20:05,791 --> 01:20:06,958
Mom.

797
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:09,666
Mom.

798
01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:41,083
Mom!

799
01:20:43,541 --> 01:20:45,708
Mom!

800
01:20:53,833 --> 01:20:57,416
Mom!

801
01:21:10,708 --> 01:21:14,958
DARKNESS ALWAYS SEEKS YOUR SADNESS,
YOUR ANGER, AND YOUR HAPPINESS

802
01:21:15,041 --> 01:21:19,250
AND ONLY GOD IS THE BEST SALVATION

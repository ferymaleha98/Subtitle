{\an8}DANCING VILLAGE
1955

4
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:15,785
To the ruler of the forest,

5
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:17,369
the ruler of this place.

6
00:01:18,204 --> 00:01:24,835
I offer these dancers for your selection.

7
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:27,505
To the ruler of the forest,

8
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:29,131
the ruler of this place.

9
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:35,805
I offer these dancers for your selection.

10
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,476
To the ruler of the forest,

11
00:01:40,476 --> 00:01:42,812
the ruler of this place.

12
00:01:42,812 --> 00:01:47,650
I offer these dancers for your selection.

13
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:51,570
Save this village from the impending doom.

14
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,557
Inggri!

15
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,774
Bring this object out of this village.

16
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:13,235
Quick!

17
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:14,236
Inggri!

18
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:17,531
Run, child!

19
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,201
Come on!

20
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:45,851
Run.

21
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:49,980
Don't ever look back.

22
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,857
- But...
- It's okay.

23
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:54,777
It's okay, child. Hurry. Go.

24
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:51,583
Child.

25
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:57,256
Don't take that, child.

26
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,763
Do not get involved.

27
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:12,938
Return it.

28
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,360
Return it.

29
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:21,363
Return it!

30
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:37,087
Don't take it, child!

31
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:24,635
{\an8}25 YEARS LATER
EAST JAVA, 1980

32
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:18,188
Are you okay, Mil?

33
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,023
Iâ€™m fine.

34
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,608
Were you able to sleep, Mil?

35
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,360
- I was.
- Me too.

36
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,820
Let's go, Mil.

37
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,113
Let's have breakfast.

38
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,408
Is this really the place?

39
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:31,618
Yeah, I think.

40
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,580
Oh, dear.

41
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,043
Mil, here's some cake.

42
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:43,964
My grandmother said if we eat this cake,
we will be saved from bad luck.

43
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,800
Thanks, but I'm not hungry yet.

44
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,177
Let me just keep it for now.

45
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:50,596
Where's your friend?

46
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,431
Hang on.

47
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:00,480
Jito!

48
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:04,151
Wait, Arya?

49
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:05,360
My friend!

50
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,612
You're sticky.

51
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:08,155
You think you're better than me.

52
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,781
- Hang on, Mil.
- How are you?

53
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,326
If I'm not well, I wouldn't be here.

54
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,494
This is my friend, Yuda.

55
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,288
- Jito.
- Yuda.

56
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,541
What are you doing here?

57
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,335
I'd like to ask for help.

58
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,597
Don't go there, child.

59
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,310
Don't.

60
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:03,979
Don't.

61
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,690
Don't go there, child!

62
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,735
What are you doing here?

63
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,285
Mil?

64
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:22,497
What happened?

65
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:26,793
I don't know.

66
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:27,878
Come on.

67
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:35,719
This is the village I'm looking for.

68
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,179
The one with the gate.

69
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:39,473
Do you know the place, Jito?

70
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:46,146
About this gate,
every village here has a gate like this.

71
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,399
The gate looks like this.

72
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,860
How come you don't know? Look again!

73
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:55,989
What's going on here?

74
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,199
You said he knows.

75
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:00,869
You really don't know?

76
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,417
Sorry, Jito.

77
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:10,462
We need to go there.

78
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:13,965
There's something we need to do
for Mila's mother,

79
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:16,468
my aunt, who is currently sick.

80
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:18,678
Try to remember.

81
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:19,930
This is important.

82
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,101
To?

83
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,063
This a drawing of a dancer, right?

84
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:31,066
I think so.

85
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:33,276
A village with dancers.

86
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,949
It exists!

87
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:40,659
There's this village I know of.

88
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:44,162
Well, the village is often called
the Dancing Village

89
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:47,249
because a lot of dancers come from there.

90
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,627
Is that the village?

91
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:54,089
I told you this friend of mine
can help us.

92
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:58,718
Can you take us there?

93
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,345
Oh, dear.

94
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:01,721
It's far away.

95
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,391
The village
is in the middle of the forest.

96
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,435
What should we do?

97
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:09,688
Wait. What's this?

98
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,233
- You don't need to...
- So you don't want it?

99
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,527
Only if you insist.

100
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:24,035
Six thousand.
This is only half of it, right?

101
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:32,878
Yes, this is only half of it.

102
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:35,255
I'll give you more when we return.

103
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:40,260
What do we do now, To?

104
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:44,055
Are you sure you want to go there?

105
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,932
- We are.
- Hold on.

106
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,767
I'm going to change my clothes first.

107
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,519
Oh, dear!

108
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,899
Stop, you'll hurt me.

109
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:42,656
All good, Mil?

110
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:48,161
- Just go straight ahead from here?
- That's right.

111
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:50,330
Okay, then.

112
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,748
- Thanks.
- Okay.

113
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:57,379
- Thank you.
- Okay.

114
00:13:57,379 --> 00:14:00,590
Let's go, Mil. The sooner we finish,
the sooner we can go home.

115
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:08,431
- Thank you.
- Okay.

116
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,185
What is it?

117
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,772
Is this really the way?

118
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,942
Yes, this path leads to Dancing Village.

119
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:38,336
Why didn't you tell us
they put an offering here?

120
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:39,879
Sorry.

121
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,965
I didn't know about this.

122
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:44,551
Are there any more offerings ahead?

123
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,389
Don't know.

124
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,058
Still far ahead?

125
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,603
I'm sorry. I don't know.

126
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:56,688
This is my first time coming here.

127
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:02,360
My whole life, this is my first time
entering a place like this.

128
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,446
Is there no other way?

129
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,824
I told you earlier.

130
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:10,368
The village
is in the middle of the forest.

131
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:11,828
I told you, right?

132
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:12,829
Right?

133
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,175
Mil?

134
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:27,969
Do you hear that?

135
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,143
Do you hear that?

136
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:37,729
Hear what?

137
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:41,858
Nothing.

138
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:42,942
Let's go.

139
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,376
Just like in the drawing.

140
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,512
- Hey.
- Let's go.

141
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:12,889
Come on.

142
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:33,118
Come on, move gracefully.

143
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,453
Come on.

144
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:40,792
Good.

145
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:48,299
Mil.

146
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,143
Ask her, quickly.

147
00:16:58,143 --> 00:16:59,561
Be patient.

148
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,107
Excuse me.

149
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:06,317
May I ask you something?

150
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:09,362
I'd like to meet with the elder here,
where should we go?

151
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,408
Over there, at the end.

152
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:16,703
But our elder, Putri, just died.

153
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:19,038
We belong to Allah,
and to Him, we shall return...

154
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,373
What business do you have here?

155
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,752
Sorry, Miss.

156
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:27,046
If I have some questions,
to whom should I ask?

157
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,632
Buyut, but he's currently away.

158
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:34,387
Do you know when he'll be back?

159
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:35,889
I don't know.

160
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,815
Should we just go home for now?

161
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:48,359
Let's come back here
when Buyut has returned.

162
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,028
If you want to go home,
we have to do it now.

163
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:51,946
I'm afraid there will be no truck
passing by when it's dark.

164
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,491
What do you say, Mil?

165
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:00,830
Let's just wait here for a while.

166
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:09,714
Excuse me.

167
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,134
If you allow us,

168
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:14,385
may we...

169
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:17,889
stay here in this village
until Buyut returns?

170
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,185
We can stay anywhere.

171
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:26,981
At the guard post.

172
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:28,107
Is that okay?

173
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:34,489
- Thank you, Miss.
- Let me take you there.

174
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,451
Excuse me, may I know your name?

175
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:39,661
Sundari.

176
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,747
- Are you sure about this?
- Her name's Sundari.

177
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,002
Only this place is available.

178
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,257
Thank you, Miss.

179
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:54,384
Thank you, Miss.

180
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:00,265
It must be cold here at night.

181
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,522
Wear this, Mil. It's cold.

182
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:08,773
Thanks.

183
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:12,318
I don't think you can sleep here.

184
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:14,821
It's okay.

185
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:17,156
"It's okay."

186
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,453
Do you want the cake I brought, Mil?

187
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:26,082
You can have it.

188
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:32,422
Excuse me.

189
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:35,550
Excuse me, Miss.

190
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,845
I'm sorry, Miss.

191
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:39,971
What is it?

192
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:42,473
I'm Yuda.

193
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,643
We're the ones who are going to sleep
in the guard post.

194
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:48,605
Sorry, Miss, but if you allow it,

195
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:52,275
is it okay for my cousin, Mila,

196
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:56,070
to stay in your house?

197
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,238
Stay?

198
00:19:58,281 --> 00:20:01,576
I feel bad if she sleeps
in the post with us.

199
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,416
Please accept... I...

200
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,001
Sorry. You don't need to.

201
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:12,295
- It's okay.
- Seriously, you don't need to.

202
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:16,633
Okay, then.

203
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:18,343
I'll let...

204
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:20,553
your cousin stay in my house.

205
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,722
Thank you so much, Miss...

206
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:24,515
My name is Ratih.

207
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:25,600
- Ratih.
- Ratih.

208
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,185
- Let me call Mila.
- Okay.

209
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:28,603
- Just a moment.
- Okay.

210
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:29,896
Thank you.

211
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:38,947
This is my house.

212
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:43,993
This one is my mother's room.

213
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,579
If you...

214
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,915
- Mila.
- If you need anything,

215
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,083
the kitchen's here.

216
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:53,962
- The kitchen's here.
- Okay, thank you.

217
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:54,963
Yes.

218
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,591
And...

219
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:01,427
Sorry, Miss.

220
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:04,806
But if it's possible, don't be too noisy.

221
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:07,600
My mother is...

222
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,310
She is ill.

223
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:12,188
Okay.

224
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,481
Just a moment.

225
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:28,621
A clean cloth for you.

226
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,999
If you want to rest,
you're welcome to come in.

227
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,671
I can just sleep here.

228
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:38,756
Please, you can use my room.

229
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:43,177
It's okay. Please.

230
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,514
Sorry for bothering you.

231
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:48,725
You're not. Please.

232
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:50,435
- Thank you.
- Okay.

233
00:25:19,644 --> 00:25:22,647
You came here to meet me, didn't you?

234
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:28,945
Beautiful child,
I've been waiting for you for so long.

235
00:26:22,123 --> 00:26:23,040
Miss.

236
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,211
Excuse me.

237
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:30,840
But if I may know...

238
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,636
what kind of illness
does your mother have?

239
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:37,888
She...

240
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:40,933
Mother.

241
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,313
Mother...

242
00:26:57,992 --> 00:26:59,410
Sorry, Mother.

243
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:09,712
Drink first.

244
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:14,925
Drink again.

245
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:19,597
Drink, Mother.

246
00:27:23,184 --> 00:27:24,977
This way, Mother.

247
00:27:26,354 --> 00:27:27,772
Forgive me, Mother.

248
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:44,538
I'm sorry

249
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:46,624
that you had to see her like that.

250
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:51,295
My mother is in the same condition
as your mother.

251
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,508
She's also ill.

252
00:27:58,219 --> 00:27:59,345
Same?

253
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:03,891
Exactly the same.

254
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:13,150
I hope you don't mind
that I brought a shaman here.

255
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,445
I hope he can see

256
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:19,073
what's going on with your mother.

257
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:24,954
Besides...

258
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:28,457
the doctor cannot explain
the reason for your motherâ€™s condition.

259
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:30,876
Child...

260
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:42,263
Your mother brought an item
that she shouldn't have brought.

261
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:47,351
What item?

262
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:24,722
What is this?

263
00:29:24,722 --> 00:29:28,601
That item came from a faraway village.

264
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:32,229
At the easternmost tip
of the island of Java.

265
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:36,066
Return the item.

266
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:37,776
<i>If you do that,</i>

267
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,321
<i>your mother might get better.</i>

268
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,239
My mother

269
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:46,619
has been in that condition
for over a week.

270
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:50,539
I don't know why she suddenly...

271
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:52,708
can't wake up.

272
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:55,127
She can't talk either.

273
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:45,678
My purpose here

274
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:48,931
is to return this to its owner.

275
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:54,311
He said that my mother
might get better afterwards.

276
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:05,364
Is this...

277
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:06,740
a gate?

278
00:31:07,825 --> 00:31:09,201
Is that in this village?

279
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,371
It's called Tapak Tilas.

280
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:14,498
No one is allowed to go there.

281
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:18,544
Why?

282
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:24,842
I'll let Buyut explain to you about that.

283
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:30,723
Yes?

284
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:36,020
- Excuse me.
- Miss.

285
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,980
Mil. Were you able to sleep?

286
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:44,403
- Excuse me.
- Please.

287
00:31:48,032 --> 00:31:49,908
I believe this is the right village.

288
00:31:51,452 --> 00:31:54,538
I showed the drawings to Ratih.

289
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:57,625
Ratih? You showed them to her?

290
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:03,881
Ratih also said

291
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:07,384
that she thinks she has seen that gate.

292
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:11,472
But we're not allowed to go there.

293
00:32:11,472 --> 00:32:12,973
We have to wait for Buyut.

294
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:18,979
Okay, then.

295
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:21,482
Let's just wait for Buyut. Okay?

296
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:26,320
Last night, I...

297
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:30,366
I saw...

298
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:32,451
What did you see, Mil?

299
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:38,082
Do you feel something is strange here?

300
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:41,919
Yud.

301
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,629
Do you want to bathe?

302
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,717
Let's bathe first. Come on.

303
00:32:54,515 --> 00:32:56,642
Sorry, Miss.

304
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:59,311
Where can we bathe?

305
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:02,731
Let me take you.

306
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:05,651
But just a moment,
I'm going to tell my mother first.

307
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:07,069
Okay.

308
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:09,321
Take a cloth with you, Mil.

309
00:33:12,241 --> 00:33:13,283
Ouch!

310
00:33:16,245 --> 00:33:18,372
These are my friends.

311
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:20,541
I'm Jito.

312
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:22,376
I'm Ratih.

313
00:33:22,376 --> 00:33:23,460
Arya.

314
00:33:25,546 --> 00:33:27,297
Bitten by mosquitoes?

315
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:30,592
Not only mosquitoes.
There were also wasps and flying termites.

316
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:33,512
Take that.

317
00:33:34,388 --> 00:33:37,558
That's why bring a jacket.

318
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:48,402
You can bathe down there.

319
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:50,320
Okay.

320
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,407
Those are the stairs going down.

321
00:33:57,411 --> 00:33:58,662
Be careful.

322
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:00,164
- Thanks.
- Okay.

323
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:04,293
The place for females is over there.

324
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:07,588
Come on. Come down here.

325
00:34:07,588 --> 00:34:10,215
- I didn't hear you.
- I'll kick you.

326
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:15,512
- Do all the villagers bathe here?
- They do.

327
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:17,639
- Hello.
- Hello.

328
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:21,351
Yes. Only the females.

329
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:23,395
It's far, isn't it?

330
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:25,230
I'm used to it.

331
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:31,862
Excuse us.

332
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:36,825
Excuse us.

333
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:37,910
Let's go.

334
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:48,670
Is this the place?

335
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,173
It is. This is the bathing place.

336
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:52,966
The twin pool.

337
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:57,596
I heard there's another one like this.

338
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,306
But I don't know where it is.

339
00:35:02,226 --> 00:35:06,355
This pool was used by the dancers
before they performed.

340
00:35:09,191 --> 00:35:10,734
But it's only a rumor.

341
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:14,947
Is it okay for me to bathe here?

342
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:17,616
It's okay. But rinse yourself first.

343
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:20,035
Here, please.

344
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:21,036
Okay.

345
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:25,332
You use the one over there, okay?

346
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:26,625
- Thank you.
- Okay.

347
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:26,828
Ratih?

348
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:30,207
Miss.

349
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:33,752
Come here.

350
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,922
The water's so refreshing.

351
00:37:52,229 --> 00:37:54,231
Don't be shy.

352
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:11,933
What's the song about?

353
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,521
The song...

354
00:39:17,898 --> 00:39:21,318
tells a story about people.

355
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:25,197
People...

356
00:39:26,448 --> 00:39:30,077
who often break their promises.

357
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:43,882
You... are not that kind of person,
are you child?

358
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:49,763
Return my bangle.

359
00:39:51,515 --> 00:39:53,225
Return it.

360
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:32,305
Miss!

361
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:40,355
What happened?

362
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:42,440
Snakes.

363
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:47,154
- What happened?
- Let's go back.

364
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,240
What should we do, Yud?

365
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,324
I don't know.

366
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:54,244
Let's go to Buyut's house first.

367
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:56,079
Maybe he's home already.

368
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,789
So we don't need to stay another night.

369
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:00,667
Is this the right way?

370
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:02,586
It is the way. It's...

371
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:04,754
A graveyard!

372
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:09,092
- Oh, my God.
- Wait.

373
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:12,470
Oh, dear.

374
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,847
I got it wrong.

375
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,975
Come on, let's go back.

376
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:18,602
We didn't pass through here earlier.

377
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:20,103
Why are they covered by black cloths?

378
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:22,439
A graveyard like this is usually
when they die of unnatural causes.

379
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:23,857
Watch your words!

380
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:25,817
You always talk back.

381
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:28,653
- This is a graveyard.
- Who says this is a guard post?

382
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:33,158
Is this really Buyut's house?

383
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:34,868
It is.

384
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:37,204
The villagers say this is his house.

385
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:40,290
Excuse me.

386
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:44,127
Sir?

387
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:46,379
Excuse me.

388
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:50,759
Sir?

389
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:04,856
Nobody's home.

390
00:42:05,941 --> 00:42:08,526
- What is this?
- Robbers!

391
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,111
Gotcha!

392
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:13,281
Who are you looking for?

393
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:15,825
Hey! We're here
because we have some questions.

394
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:18,078
Is this really Buyut's house?

395
00:42:18,078 --> 00:42:19,996
What business do you have with him?

396
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:21,623
Hang on!

397
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:22,999
Has Buyut come home yet?

398
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:24,084
He hasn't!

399
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,462
Who are you to him?

400
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:29,005
You ask too many questions.

401
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:30,548
I'm Prabu.

402
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,676
What business do you have with him?

403
00:42:32,676 --> 00:42:34,594
Where is he?

404
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:39,766
He...

405
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:42,560
I don't know.

406
00:42:43,979 --> 00:42:45,188
When will he come home?

407
00:42:49,276 --> 00:42:50,819
I don't know.

408
00:42:50,819 --> 00:42:52,279
I'll hit you!

409
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:02,497
What do we do now?

410
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:03,915
Well...

411
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:05,208
Let's just wait.

412
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:07,919
Okay, then.

413
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:10,588
Sir.

414
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,173
I want to tell you something.

415
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:13,425
About Buyut.

416
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,554
It is said that...

417
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:19,764
he can turn into a black dog.

418
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:22,684
Sir.

419
00:43:22,684 --> 00:43:24,436
When there's danger,

420
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:28,315
his eyes turn red and light up.

421
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:30,900
And he runs fast. This is true.

422
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,902
You crazy boy!

423
00:43:32,902 --> 00:43:34,612
It's impossible!

424
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,448
How can a human turn into a dog?

425
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:39,617
- But this is true!
- You're just making up stories!

426
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:40,744
Oh, dear.

427
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:43,747
Earlier today...

428
00:43:43,747 --> 00:43:45,707
when I was taking a bath,

429
00:43:47,042 --> 00:43:48,626
I saw snakes.

430
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:49,794
Lots of them.

431
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:53,048
But they suddenly disappeared.

432
00:43:54,049 --> 00:43:55,175
Snakes?

433
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:58,511
You saw snakes?

434
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,849
We met a crazy boy earlier today.

435
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:05,060
He told us a crazy story.

436
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,354
And your friend here believed him.

437
00:44:07,354 --> 00:44:08,730
He said it was scary.

438
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:14,110
There were graves covered by black cloths.

439
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:16,988
A human that can turn to a dog.

440
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:19,032
This place is in the middle of the forest.

441
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:21,326
Don't you think there is something wrong
with this village?

442
00:44:37,384 --> 00:44:38,802
So, what do you think, Mil?

443
00:44:41,471 --> 00:44:43,306
Should we just go home?

444
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:53,608
Aren't you going to return the item?

445
00:44:57,362 --> 00:45:00,865
Shouldn't you wait for Buyut
to come back first?

446
00:45:36,985 --> 00:45:38,361
I'm so sorry.

447
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:39,904
I accidentally dropped them.

448
00:45:40,864 --> 00:45:41,906
It's okay.

449
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,015
Can you hear it?

450
00:46:14,564 --> 00:46:19,444
Maybe... there's a dance performance
going on out there?

451
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:23,948
But where?

452
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:28,495
In...

453
00:46:28,495 --> 00:46:29,954
the neighboring village?

454
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:33,041
The neighboring village?

455
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:37,337
There's...

456
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:40,340
a place where dancers practice.

457
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:44,469
Do you...

458
00:46:45,512 --> 00:46:47,013
want...

459
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:49,766
to go there?

460
00:48:44,881 --> 00:48:46,090
<i>Ratih.</i>

461
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,720
Ratih.

462
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,013
Excuse me.

463
00:49:03,733 --> 00:49:04,817
Ratih?

464
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:06,152
Mila?

465
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,281
Ratih?

466
00:49:11,908 --> 00:49:12,909
Mila?

467
00:49:30,927 --> 00:49:31,928
Mila?

468
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:50,780
They're not here.

469
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,157
Jito.

470
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:57,120
They're not here.

471
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:22,270
Shit!

472
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:27,734
Oh, God.

473
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,282
Close the door.

474
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:40,830
Yud, it's been a while.

475
00:50:42,498 --> 00:50:44,792
Where are they?
Why haven't they come home yet?

476
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:45,960
I can't find them.

477
00:50:47,462 --> 00:50:48,671
Where are they?

478
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:50,715
Mila!

479
00:50:56,304 --> 00:50:57,221
Mil!

480
00:50:58,556 --> 00:50:59,807
Excuse us, Ma'am.

481
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:03,603
Is anyone inside?

482
00:51:03,603 --> 00:51:04,729
No.

483
00:51:04,729 --> 00:51:05,813
Mila.

484
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:07,899
Thank you.

485
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:16,491
It's empty.

486
00:52:19,554 --> 00:52:20,555
Nyai.

487
00:52:21,681 --> 00:52:23,516
This is Mila.

488
00:52:27,937 --> 00:52:30,356
You finally came, child.

489
00:52:42,368 --> 00:52:44,078
Your scent...

490
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:50,126
is enticing.

491
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:03,723
Where is...

492
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:06,434
my bangle?

493
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:27,288
If...

494
00:53:28,581 --> 00:53:30,416
I return this...

495
00:53:34,462 --> 00:53:35,755
will my mother be cured?

496
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:24,387
That shaman is kind

497
00:54:27,473 --> 00:54:29,266
for leading you here.

498
00:54:48,327 --> 00:54:51,872
That item came from a faraway village.

499
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:57,003
At the easternmost tip...

500
00:54:58,170 --> 00:54:59,672
of the island of Java.

501
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:04,051
Return the item to that place.

502
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:06,637
If you do that,

503
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:09,056
your mother might be cured.

504
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:30,453
Just stay here, child.

505
00:55:45,468 --> 00:55:47,094
You've done your job, child.

506
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:56,937
Forgive me...

507
00:55:58,189 --> 00:56:00,816
but what about my mother?

508
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,321
Go home.

509
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:12,536
And meet your mother.

510
00:56:20,169 --> 00:56:21,295
Mila!

511
00:56:25,758 --> 00:56:27,343
Yud.

512
00:56:27,343 --> 00:56:29,720
We've been searching for her all day.

513
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,889
Let's go back to the village.

514
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:33,474
Maybe they've come back.

515
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:36,727
I'm hungry.

516
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:37,728
No.

517
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:39,855
I have a bad feeling.

518
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:42,399
Where else can we look?

519
00:56:45,653 --> 00:56:46,654
A food stall?

520
00:56:54,078 --> 00:56:55,162
Let's ask them.

521
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:58,457
Why is there a food stall there?

522
00:57:27,695 --> 00:57:28,946
Excuse me, Sir.

523
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:34,618
I'm looking for my cousin.

524
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:37,913
A girl this tall.

525
00:57:40,541 --> 00:57:41,542
Have you seen her?

526
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:56,307
- She has long hair.
- Let's go back.

527
00:57:57,516 --> 00:58:00,519
She went with another girl.

528
00:58:04,273 --> 00:58:05,608
Let's go back now.

529
00:58:05,608 --> 00:58:06,734
Let's go back.

530
00:58:10,863 --> 00:58:12,072
Thank you.

531
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:17,578
Child.

532
00:58:18,579 --> 00:58:20,456
You're not from around here, are you?

533
00:58:29,298 --> 00:58:31,383
I hope you can find your cousin.

534
00:58:33,802 --> 00:58:34,929
Bring this.

535
00:58:36,972 --> 00:58:38,057
Thank you.

536
00:58:38,057 --> 00:58:39,934
It just so happens that I'm hungry.

537
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,279
It's rude to reject someone's gift.

538
00:58:57,034 --> 00:58:59,453
Hurry. It's going to rain.

539
00:59:38,867 --> 00:59:39,952
Ratih!

540
00:59:51,672 --> 00:59:52,756
Ratih!

541
00:59:55,134 --> 00:59:56,218
Ratih!

542
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,432
Ratih! Wait for me!

543
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:07,313
Ratih, who was that?

544
01:00:09,231 --> 01:00:13,068
Her name is Badarawuhi.

545
01:00:16,697 --> 01:00:18,907
She promised me that if I helped her,

546
01:00:18,907 --> 01:00:20,909
my mother would be safe.

547
01:00:30,878 --> 01:00:32,087
Ratih...

548
01:00:42,431 --> 01:00:43,349
Ratih...

549
01:00:45,601 --> 01:00:47,394
Help me!

550
01:00:49,438 --> 01:00:51,357
Help me!

551
01:00:52,483 --> 01:00:53,984
Help me!

552
01:00:55,361 --> 01:00:57,196
Mother...

553
01:00:57,196 --> 01:00:59,656
Help me!

554
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:02,659
Mother!

555
01:01:04,203 --> 01:01:05,662
Poor woman,

556
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:06,955
your mother.

557
01:01:09,792 --> 01:01:11,210
Who are you?

558
01:01:12,127 --> 01:01:13,545
Badarawuhi.

559
01:01:23,931 --> 01:01:25,349
Right now,

560
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:28,435
your mother is suffering, child.

561
01:01:31,522 --> 01:01:33,982
You can save her.

562
01:01:36,652 --> 01:01:38,070
As long as you...

563
01:01:39,405 --> 01:01:41,281
help me.

564
01:01:47,871 --> 01:01:50,249
Mila! Mila!

565
01:01:58,757 --> 01:01:59,967
Mila.

566
01:01:59,967 --> 01:02:02,136
What happened?

567
01:02:02,136 --> 01:02:03,429
- Miss...
- Let's go back.

568
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:06,265
That's all.

569
01:02:06,265 --> 01:02:08,434
I only did what she told me to.

570
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:21,405
But you knew she's not human.

571
01:02:34,543 --> 01:02:35,544
Ratih...

572
01:02:37,337 --> 01:02:38,714
Ratih!

573
01:02:38,714 --> 01:02:46,138
Mother!

574
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:51,477
I did what she told me to!

575
01:02:54,897 --> 01:02:56,315
Mother...

576
01:03:09,036 --> 01:03:10,245
Mother...

577
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:36,021
Mother, what should I do?

578
01:03:53,038 --> 01:03:54,748
Oh, God! Mila!

579
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:57,459
Mila!

580
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:00,462
Where have you been?

581
01:04:00,462 --> 01:04:01,797
- Oh, my God.
- I want to go home!

582
01:04:01,797 --> 01:04:03,507
- Mil...
- I want to see my mother!

583
01:04:03,507 --> 01:04:05,551
Mil, there is lightning! It's dangerous!

584
01:04:05,551 --> 01:04:08,136
- Let's go back in!
- Run!

585
01:04:08,136 --> 01:04:09,513
It's dangerous!

586
01:04:14,226 --> 01:04:15,769
- Where do you want to go?
- I have to go home.

587
01:04:15,769 --> 01:04:17,187
Hey, Mil.

588
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:18,605
You want to go home in this weather?

589
01:04:18,605 --> 01:04:20,732
- I have to see my mother's condition!
- Mila, it's dangerous!

590
01:04:20,732 --> 01:04:23,652
- I have to see my mother's condition!
- But it's dangerous!

591
01:04:24,653 --> 01:04:25,988
Yuda is right.

592
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:29,032
You won't find any vehicle in this storm.

593
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:31,743
But we donâ€™t have time.

594
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:35,080
I have to make sure
that what I did was right.

595
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:36,790
What are you talking about, Mil?

596
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:39,626
What did you do?

597
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:01,273
I've returned the item.

598
01:05:05,444 --> 01:05:07,446
But why does it feel wrong?

599
01:05:11,366 --> 01:05:12,701
You mean...

600
01:05:12,701 --> 01:05:15,078
you were gone all day

601
01:05:15,078 --> 01:05:16,622
just to return the item?

602
01:05:18,498 --> 01:05:19,708
All day?

603
01:05:21,752 --> 01:05:23,962
I was only gone for a little while.

604
01:05:26,506 --> 01:05:29,760
We looked for you all day, Mil.

605
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,303
In the forest too.

606
01:05:33,221 --> 01:05:35,223
Why didn't you ask me to come with you?

607
01:05:36,308 --> 01:05:37,934
It's dangerous, you know.

608
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:51,073
I was worried about my mother.

609
01:05:51,073 --> 01:05:53,158
I know, but it's dangerous.

610
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:54,660
I'm scared.

611
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:01,083
I was worried about my mother.

612
01:06:10,509 --> 01:06:13,428
What is that smell?

613
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:33,365
What is that?

614
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:35,909
What were you thinking?

615
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:38,078
There was a food stall
in the middle of the forest.

616
01:06:38,078 --> 01:06:39,746
People with black nails.

617
01:06:39,746 --> 01:06:41,748
Why did you accept the food?

618
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:44,918
What did I eat then?

619
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:48,380
A monkey!

620
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:49,881
What's going on?

621
01:08:14,382 --> 01:08:15,383
Mil?

622
01:08:16,635 --> 01:08:17,636
Mila?

623
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:22,265
Mila, my beautiful daughter.

624
01:08:24,643 --> 01:08:26,228
Wake up.

625
01:08:27,562 --> 01:08:29,064
Mother?

626
01:08:29,064 --> 01:08:30,357
What's wrong?

627
01:08:31,149 --> 01:08:32,484
You had a nightmare?

628
01:08:35,821 --> 01:08:37,781
No. I'm fine.

629
01:08:37,781 --> 01:08:39,574
Let's eat.

630
01:08:39,574 --> 01:08:42,077
I've made your favorite food,
Lontong Balap.

631
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:45,080
I'll eat it later.

632
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,706
I'm still tired.

633
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:49,417
Eat now.

634
01:08:49,417 --> 01:08:51,670
Later. Stay here, Mother.
Don't go anywhere.

635
01:08:51,670 --> 01:08:53,463
Stay here while I rest.

636
01:09:39,718 --> 01:09:41,344
My beautiful child.

637
01:09:51,229 --> 01:09:52,230
Mil.

638
01:09:53,481 --> 01:09:54,482
Mila.

639
01:10:01,823 --> 01:10:03,408
My beautiful child.

640
01:10:27,349 --> 01:10:28,350
Mil?

641
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:53,708
Mila...

642
01:10:56,461 --> 01:10:57,462
Go home, child.

643
01:10:58,463 --> 01:11:00,006
You don't need to save me.

644
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:05,136
You don't know what you're about to face.

645
01:11:05,136 --> 01:11:07,055
It's very dangerous.

646
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:13,395
Don't give in
to any of Badarawuhi's persuasion.

647
01:11:13,395 --> 01:11:14,562
Don't!

648
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:16,940
Go home, child.

649
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:18,692
- Go home.
- Mother?

650
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:27,450
I can't stay long. She has seen me.

651
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:48,847
Mil? Mil?

652
01:11:54,686 --> 01:11:55,854
Mother.

653
01:11:55,854 --> 01:11:56,855
Wait.

654
01:11:57,689 --> 01:11:59,065
- Wait. Don't!
- Mother!

655
01:11:59,065 --> 01:12:00,984
- Wait.
- Mother!

656
01:12:02,193 --> 01:12:03,611
Mother!

657
01:12:04,779 --> 01:12:06,990
Mother!

658
01:12:09,034 --> 01:12:10,744
Mother!

659
01:12:12,579 --> 01:12:14,622
Mother!

660
01:12:22,922 --> 01:12:25,216
Beautiful child.

661
01:12:26,134 --> 01:12:30,346
Your mothers are now in Angkara Murka.

662
01:12:34,476 --> 01:12:36,561
The villagers here

663
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:40,148
know what they have to do.

664
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:42,442
Perform the ritual, child.

665
01:12:45,028 --> 01:12:46,821
Perform the ritual...

666
01:12:54,162 --> 01:12:56,456
before they all...

667
01:12:57,999 --> 01:12:59,167
get hurt.

668
01:13:06,674 --> 01:13:09,177
Mother. Mother.

669
01:13:09,177 --> 01:13:11,971
- Ratih!
- Mother!

670
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:17,435
Mother!

671
01:13:17,435 --> 01:13:18,978
No!

672
01:13:18,978 --> 01:13:21,106
- Don't!
- Don't!

673
01:13:21,106 --> 01:13:24,317
Mother... Mother, what's going on?

674
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:26,152
Mother...

675
01:13:26,986 --> 01:13:28,488
- Ratih!
- Ratih!

676
01:13:55,056 --> 01:13:56,099
Ratih!

677
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:05,608
Mother! Enough!

678
01:14:05,608 --> 01:14:07,735
Stop it, Mother!

679
01:14:07,735 --> 01:14:13,449
Mother... Mother...

680
01:14:15,535 --> 01:14:17,036
Mother!

681
01:14:17,745 --> 01:14:22,500
Buyut! My mother! Help her!

682
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:28,548
Why did you bring this bangle here?

683
01:14:29,841 --> 01:14:30,925
I'm sorry.

684
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:34,846
What is actually going on?

685
01:14:37,307 --> 01:14:39,142
Before she died,

686
01:14:40,101 --> 01:14:43,104
your grandmother had told me
to look for your mother.

687
01:14:49,152 --> 01:14:52,155
I came to your mother's house.

688
01:14:53,114 --> 01:14:54,616
But it was too late.

689
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:59,579
Badarawuhi got to her first.

690
01:15:00,872 --> 01:15:02,081
Pardon me.

691
01:15:03,041 --> 01:15:04,000
Grandmother?

692
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:08,129
Your mother is Inggri.

693
01:15:09,464 --> 01:15:12,967
She's Putri's only child.

694
01:15:14,761 --> 01:15:16,054
You mean...

695
01:15:16,888 --> 01:15:18,890
Putri, the village elder?

696
01:15:24,395 --> 01:15:26,773
Your grandmother died

697
01:15:26,773 --> 01:15:31,110
from bearing the heavy burden
of this village's tradition.

698
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:34,155
She wanted to protect your mother

699
01:15:34,155 --> 01:15:36,699
and the entire village.

700
01:15:37,575 --> 01:15:39,202
Protect them from what?

701
01:15:43,957 --> 01:15:47,043
Jiyanti's aura
attracts supernatural beings.

702
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:50,421
I don't want her to be chosen
as the dancer.

DANCING VILLAGE

704
01:15:55,593 --> 01:15:57,345
If someone needs to die,

705
01:15:57,345 --> 01:15:58,763
<i>let me be the one,</i>

706
01:15:58,763 --> 01:16:01,182
<i>and don't let my twin know.</i>

707
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:02,684
What's going on here, Mother?

708
01:16:03,810 --> 01:16:05,937
Why are my friends here?

709
01:16:05,937 --> 01:16:06,938
Tomorrow...

710
01:16:06,938 --> 01:16:10,275
your friends will dance for this village.

711
01:16:11,109 --> 01:16:15,113
<i>Are you sure you want to do this?</i>

712
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:19,075
<i>What if Badarawuhi knows</i>

713
01:16:19,075 --> 01:16:22,912
<i>that Santika is not the chosen dancer?</i>

714
01:16:24,539 --> 01:16:27,667
Twins have the same placentas.

715
01:16:28,793 --> 01:16:32,880
If not now, there will be
no other opportunities.

716
01:16:34,549 --> 01:16:35,925
Do you want...

717
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:41,889
this village to continue
to be the slave of that devil?

718
01:16:46,644 --> 01:16:48,146
Your job...

719
01:16:49,981 --> 01:16:53,609
is to take Inggri away from this village.

720
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:56,571
But, Mbah, you...

721
01:16:57,822 --> 01:17:00,783
will never meet Inggri.

722
01:17:01,784 --> 01:17:02,869
Forever.

723
01:17:09,417 --> 01:17:11,961
<i>On the night of the ritual,</i>

724
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:15,882
<i>the fates of the twins were switched.</i>

725
01:17:16,966 --> 01:17:18,384
<i>Jiyanti...</i>

726
01:17:18,384 --> 01:17:21,054
<i>who was supposed to be the chosen dancer</i>

727
01:17:21,054 --> 01:17:22,847
<i>was replaced by Santika.</i>

728
01:17:23,556 --> 01:17:26,017
<i>We had to do it</i>

729
01:17:26,017 --> 01:17:28,353
<i>to deceive Badarawuhi</i>

730
01:17:28,978 --> 01:17:33,691
<i>and to take the bangle
out of this village.</i>

731
01:17:33,691 --> 01:17:35,610
Take this thing out of this village.

732
01:17:37,487 --> 01:17:38,529
Hurry!

733
01:17:38,529 --> 01:17:39,739
Inggri!

734
01:17:39,739 --> 01:17:42,700
<i>This whole secret,</i>

735
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:44,869
<i>no one knew about it</i>

736
01:17:44,869 --> 01:17:47,288
<i>except the two of us.</i>

737
01:17:48,331 --> 01:17:51,751
<i>The sacrifice Santika had made</i>

738
01:17:51,751 --> 01:17:55,004
<i>caused a great pain</i>

739
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:57,924
<i>especially to Jiyanti.</i>

740
01:17:58,883 --> 01:18:00,760
<i>But thanks to that,</i>

741
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:04,305
<i>the village was able to be free
from Badarawuhi's clutch.</i>

742
01:18:04,305 --> 01:18:07,350
It's not your responsibility.

743
01:18:10,853 --> 01:18:12,188
Return it.

744
01:18:12,939 --> 01:18:15,191
Don't take it.

745
01:18:15,191 --> 01:18:18,027
Return it!

{\an8}DANCING VILLAGE

747
01:18:21,614 --> 01:18:26,994
{\an8}<i>Badarawuhi could not choose a dancer
for 25 years.</i>

748
01:18:28,162 --> 01:18:33,584
<i>And all that time, Putri endured the pain
as a result of her decision.</i>

749
01:18:47,348 --> 01:18:51,102
This bangle should not have been
brought back here.

750
01:19:00,862 --> 01:19:02,572
It was wrong for me to come here.

751
01:19:05,074 --> 01:19:06,993
Forgive me...

752
01:19:08,244 --> 01:19:10,037
This is all my fault.

753
01:19:11,372 --> 01:19:14,625
But what about my mother now?

754
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:35,938
While I'm inside,

755
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:38,941
no one is allowed to come in.

756
01:19:43,571 --> 01:19:44,489
Okay.

757
01:19:45,865 --> 01:19:49,368
That is a rare black chicken
used in rituals,

758
01:19:49,368 --> 01:19:50,912
which means it's serious.

759
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:51,889
Don't.

760
01:20:54,392 --> 01:20:56,978
In the east, don't open a door so easily.

761
01:20:57,895 --> 01:21:00,898
You never know what's behind it.

762
01:22:09,967 --> 01:22:11,677
Oh, my God.

763
01:22:18,893 --> 01:22:21,145
How did all the livestock die?

764
01:22:23,022 --> 01:22:26,859
All of the cows are dead!

765
01:22:38,704 --> 01:22:43,584
What's going on here?

766
01:22:45,586 --> 01:22:47,588
All of my crops are ruined!

767
01:22:50,216 --> 01:22:51,634
What happened?

768
01:23:06,649 --> 01:23:07,983
Jito!

769
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:09,360
Oh, God.

770
01:23:14,657 --> 01:23:16,492
Come on. Let's go home.

771
01:23:16,492 --> 01:23:17,785
We have to go home now!

772
01:23:39,306 --> 01:23:42,727
In my grandparents' house,
this is used to avoid misfortunes.

773
01:23:45,688 --> 01:23:47,523
You are the misfortune.

774
01:23:47,523 --> 01:23:49,567
- Don't be a know-it-all.
- I'm serious.

775
01:23:50,526 --> 01:23:52,027
Here.

776
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:53,195
I'm sorry.

777
01:23:56,824 --> 01:23:58,033
Don't get involved.

778
01:24:03,497 --> 01:24:04,415
Mil.

779
01:24:05,541 --> 01:24:06,459
Mila.

780
01:24:08,961 --> 01:24:10,588
Why hasn't she gotten ready yet?

781
01:24:11,922 --> 01:24:12,840
Mil.

782
01:24:14,216 --> 01:24:15,342
Let's go home.

783
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:25,561
What else are you going to do, Mil?

784
01:24:27,813 --> 01:24:29,815
I want to make sure
they perform the ritual.

785
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:32,902
You don't need to.

786
01:24:32,902 --> 01:24:34,862
We better go home now.

787
01:24:34,862 --> 01:24:36,989
See your mother's condition back home.

788
01:24:36,989 --> 01:24:38,073
Come on.

789
01:24:39,158 --> 01:24:41,285
Maybe the ritual can help my mother.

790
01:24:43,037 --> 01:24:45,122
I don't want this journey to go to waste.

791
01:24:56,425 --> 01:24:57,468
Drink this.

792
01:25:13,859 --> 01:25:15,277
How does it taste?

793
01:25:16,445 --> 01:25:17,655
Sweet.

794
01:25:19,698 --> 01:25:23,285
She is the last one.

795
01:25:23,285 --> 01:25:25,496
There's no other girl.

796
01:25:29,917 --> 01:25:32,545
You want to taste the coffee?

797
01:25:34,255 --> 01:25:35,172
Mil.

798
01:25:43,722 --> 01:25:45,140
Drink it, child.

799
01:25:54,733 --> 01:25:55,943
How does it taste?

800
01:25:57,736 --> 01:25:58,737
Sweet.

801
01:26:14,461 --> 01:26:15,880
This is bitter.

802
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:19,508
Don't talk nonsense.

803
01:26:20,426 --> 01:26:21,594
Let's go.

804
01:26:21,594 --> 01:26:24,471
You've been chosen...

805
01:26:24,471 --> 01:26:28,517
as one of the dancers of this village.

806
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:30,102
What are you talking about?

807
01:26:31,270 --> 01:26:34,106
She only chooses seven candidates
to become Dawuhs.

808
01:26:34,106 --> 01:26:40,613
If the coffee is sweet, it's a sign
that she has to perform the ritual.

809
01:26:45,534 --> 01:26:47,870
This is the cloth for the ritual.

810
01:26:47,870 --> 01:26:51,624
Why can't we be there for the ritual?

811
01:26:52,374 --> 01:26:55,210
Sorry, but they say...

812
01:26:56,503 --> 01:26:58,422
that's the way itâ€™s done.

813
01:26:58,422 --> 01:27:01,425
No one from this village
can go for the ritual.

814
01:27:01,425 --> 01:27:04,345
Only the elders.

815
01:27:21,946 --> 01:27:24,615
What if something happens to you there?

816
01:27:25,407 --> 01:27:26,825
We donâ€™t know anything.

817
01:27:28,577 --> 01:27:30,663
My job here is to protect you, Mil.

818
01:27:31,789 --> 01:27:33,415
We will stay here

819
01:27:35,125 --> 01:27:36,418
until Mila comes back.

820
01:27:37,294 --> 01:27:40,923
Mil, but promise us
that you will come back.

821
01:27:42,007 --> 01:27:43,926
What are you two saying?

822
01:27:45,052 --> 01:27:47,972
Who can guarantee that Mila
will be safe there?

823
01:27:50,391 --> 01:27:51,392
I won't accept it.

824
01:27:52,559 --> 01:27:53,560
I can't.

825
01:27:54,937 --> 01:27:57,147
You can't join something

826
01:27:57,147 --> 01:27:59,525
without knowing the consequences.

827
01:28:00,484 --> 01:28:02,236
If your mother knew, she would forbid you!

828
01:28:02,236 --> 01:28:03,654
So, what should I do then?

829
01:28:07,116 --> 01:28:08,993
This is the only way.

830
01:28:19,670 --> 01:28:22,464
We will perform a ritual

831
01:28:22,464 --> 01:28:25,884
that hasn't been done for a long time...

832
01:28:26,969 --> 01:28:29,388
<i>to save this village.</i>

833
01:28:32,850 --> 01:28:34,935
<i>One dancer</i>

834
01:28:34,935 --> 01:28:40,482
<i>will do her duty as the chosen dancer</i>

835
01:28:40,482 --> 01:28:43,235
<i>to protect this village</i>

836
01:28:43,235 --> 01:28:47,322
<i>in the years to come.</i>

837
01:28:57,249 --> 01:28:59,877
<i>Close your doors and windows.</i>

838
01:29:00,836 --> 01:29:03,922
<i>Keep on hitting the bamboo</i>

839
01:29:03,922 --> 01:29:07,134
<i>to repel uninvited guests</i>

840
01:29:07,134 --> 01:29:09,511
<i>born from the darkness.</i>

841
01:29:11,305 --> 01:29:15,934
<i>Don't stop hitting the bamboo
to protect this village.</i>

842
01:29:16,935 --> 01:29:20,564
<i>The village that is surrounded
by supernatural beings.</i>

843
01:29:21,815 --> 01:29:24,234
<i>Don't come out of your houses,</i>

844
01:29:24,234 --> 01:29:26,320
<i>whatever happens.</i>

845
01:29:27,905 --> 01:29:30,032
<i>Because tonight,</i>

846
01:29:30,032 --> 01:29:33,327
<i>the supernatural will come out
and eat anything.</i>

847
01:29:34,620 --> 01:29:35,662
Mil.

848
01:29:35,662 --> 01:29:37,372
Don't do this. Please.

849
01:29:39,917 --> 01:29:40,834
Mila.

850
01:29:47,049 --> 01:29:50,135
<i>Keep hitting the bamboos</i>

851
01:29:50,135 --> 01:29:53,430
<i>until the ritual is finished.</i>

852
01:29:54,473 --> 01:29:56,225
<i>Don't stop.</i>

853
01:29:57,142 --> 01:29:59,770
<i>Don't ever stop.</i>

854
01:30:50,487 --> 01:30:54,283
This will be painful.

855
01:30:54,283 --> 01:30:57,870
But this is your only way to come back.

856
01:30:58,829 --> 01:31:03,125
After this, you will dance all day.

857
01:31:09,089 --> 01:31:10,090
But I...

858
01:31:10,924 --> 01:31:12,384
can't dance.

859
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:15,012
You can.

860
01:31:27,107 --> 01:31:28,859
Kneel, please.

861
01:31:33,071 --> 01:31:36,533
Don't stop playing the music

862
01:31:36,533 --> 01:31:40,412
until the last dancer falls.

863
01:31:40,412 --> 01:31:42,831
Inhale the shawl.

864
01:32:37,636 --> 01:32:39,930
To the ruler of the forest,

865
01:32:39,930 --> 01:32:42,683
the ruler of this place.

866
01:32:42,683 --> 01:32:47,604
I offer these dancers for your selection.

867
01:32:47,604 --> 01:32:53,110
Save this village from the impending doom.

868
01:32:53,944 --> 01:32:55,946
One by one,

869
01:32:55,946 --> 01:32:59,449
soul to end the anger.

870
01:33:12,004 --> 01:33:15,424
Child, what did you see over there?

871
01:34:10,312 --> 01:34:11,813
It's almost dark.

872
01:34:12,898 --> 01:34:14,191
Mila still hasn't come back.

873
01:34:16,276 --> 01:34:19,237
- I have a bad feeling.
- Don't!

874
01:34:19,237 --> 01:34:20,739
Remember what Buyut said.

875
01:34:25,577 --> 01:34:26,495
Jito.

876
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:48,100
Why hasn't anyone been chosen?
It's been too long.

877
01:34:49,643 --> 01:34:56,650
It's the first time I have seen
something like this.

878
01:35:37,023 --> 01:35:37,941
Child.

879
01:35:39,484 --> 01:35:40,902
Here...

880
01:35:41,820 --> 01:35:44,448
you are loved.

881
01:35:47,868 --> 01:35:49,953
Adored.

882
01:35:49,953 --> 01:35:52,831
Like a flower

883
01:35:52,831 --> 01:35:56,918
that smells very good.

884
01:36:03,967 --> 01:36:06,595
Don't you want to stay here, child?

885
01:36:12,058 --> 01:36:13,685
What about my mother?

886
01:36:49,221 --> 01:36:50,347
What's wrong, child?

887
01:36:52,974 --> 01:36:53,892
Scared?

888
01:36:57,229 --> 01:36:59,314
Stay here, child.

889
01:37:01,399 --> 01:37:03,610
Accompany me.

890
01:37:09,866 --> 01:37:11,284
Won't you?

891
01:37:13,828 --> 01:37:15,914
Accompany me, child.

892
01:37:15,914 --> 01:37:16,998
No...

893
01:37:20,335 --> 01:37:21,336
No...

894
01:37:22,546 --> 01:37:23,547
No...

895
01:37:24,548 --> 01:37:25,549
No!

896
01:37:39,145 --> 01:37:41,606
What did you see, child?

897
01:37:44,234 --> 01:37:45,735
Bada...

898
01:37:45,735 --> 01:37:47,237
Badarawuhi.

899
01:37:57,789 --> 01:37:59,749
Why is she dancing again?

900
01:38:13,179 --> 01:38:15,390
Cover them with a white cloth.

901
01:38:42,834 --> 01:38:46,296
We have to try to stop this.

902
01:38:46,296 --> 01:38:48,798
They're still unconscious.

903
01:38:50,091 --> 01:38:51,718
They haven't come back.

904
01:38:56,389 --> 01:38:58,475
Dancers...

905
01:38:58,475 --> 01:39:10,028
- Dancers...
- Dancers...

906
01:39:11,363 --> 01:39:15,533
We can't be here. Come on,
take them to the village immediately.

907
01:39:37,847 --> 01:39:40,058
- Dancers...
- Dancers...

908
01:39:52,070 --> 01:39:53,822
- Come.
- Put it there.

909
01:39:53,822 --> 01:39:55,240
What's happening?

910
01:39:55,240 --> 01:39:56,491
Be careful.

911
01:40:00,745 --> 01:40:02,831
- Go on, go home, hurry.
- Yes.

912
01:40:02,831 --> 01:40:04,499
- Yes.
- Go home.

913
01:40:04,499 --> 01:40:07,877
- What's going on here?
- Protect your family.

914
01:40:07,877 --> 01:40:08,962
Mil?

915
01:40:08,962 --> 01:40:10,338
- Mila?
- Calm down.

916
01:40:10,338 --> 01:40:11,965
What happened to Mila?

917
01:40:11,965 --> 01:40:14,968
- What's happening to her?
- Get some salt.

918
01:40:14,968 --> 01:40:18,388
Throw it to every side of this room.

919
01:40:18,388 --> 01:40:20,849
Mil! Hang on, what's going on?

920
01:40:20,849 --> 01:40:22,016
- Wake up, Mil.
- What's going on here?

921
01:40:22,016 --> 01:40:23,143
Mil, wake up. Mil.

922
01:40:27,313 --> 01:40:28,732
Oh, God. Ratih.

923
01:40:29,607 --> 01:40:30,608
Ratih...

924
01:40:33,278 --> 01:40:34,696
Mila...

925
01:40:34,696 --> 01:40:37,073
- Yud!
- What's happening to her?

926
01:40:37,073 --> 01:40:41,035
Badarawuhi hasn't chosen
between Mila and Ratih.

927
01:40:41,035 --> 01:40:45,123
One thing is for sure,
currently, both of them

928
01:40:45,123 --> 01:40:47,709
are in Angkara Murka.

929
01:40:47,709 --> 01:40:50,253
What should we do?

930
01:40:50,253 --> 01:40:51,671
Mila, wake up!

931
01:40:51,671 --> 01:40:53,465
Help my cousin.

932
01:41:07,937 --> 01:41:09,105
Ratih?

933
01:41:19,199 --> 01:41:20,408
Ratih?

934
01:41:26,498 --> 01:41:27,707
Mother?

935
01:42:09,457 --> 01:42:12,377
Stay here. Let's play together.

936
01:42:21,219 --> 01:42:34,524
Let's play together!

937
01:42:41,447 --> 01:42:44,492
Mil, wake up! Mil, wake up! Mil!

938
01:42:57,130 --> 01:42:58,131
Yuda!

939
01:42:58,965 --> 01:43:00,425
Are you all right?

940
01:43:03,052 --> 01:43:04,888
- Close the door!
- What happened, Yud?

941
01:43:15,315 --> 01:43:16,733
Close the door!

942
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:49,761
Ratih!

943
01:46:31,219 --> 01:46:33,221
Stay here, child.

944
01:46:37,350 --> 01:46:38,768
Accompany...

945
01:46:39,811 --> 01:46:40,728
her.

946
01:46:42,188 --> 01:46:43,523
Ratih...

947
01:46:51,322 --> 01:46:52,240
Ratih!

948
01:46:54,408 --> 01:46:55,827
Don't you want...

949
01:46:56,577 --> 01:46:57,620
to be...

950
01:46:59,413 --> 01:47:00,498
like her?

951
01:47:03,918 --> 01:47:05,044
Ratih...

952
01:47:07,088 --> 01:47:08,881
with her mother...

953
01:47:11,008 --> 01:47:12,343
Jiyanti.

954
01:47:26,607 --> 01:47:30,027
Someone wants to meet you.

955
01:47:38,619 --> 01:47:40,913
- Mila!
- Mother!

956
01:47:44,542 --> 01:47:45,501
Mila!

957
01:47:50,339 --> 01:47:51,424
Mila!

958
01:47:56,137 --> 01:47:57,138
Mother!

959
01:48:00,391 --> 01:48:01,392
Mila!

960
01:48:14,030 --> 01:48:16,407
Mother... Mother!

961
01:48:17,742 --> 01:48:18,784
Mil...

962
01:48:20,036 --> 01:48:21,162
Mother!

963
01:48:27,126 --> 01:48:30,129
- Mila!
- Mother!

964
01:48:30,129 --> 01:48:31,589
Mother!

965
01:48:31,589 --> 01:48:34,634
Mil... Mila!

966
01:48:34,634 --> 01:48:35,927
Mother!

967
01:48:45,561 --> 01:48:47,021
Mother?

968
01:48:47,021 --> 01:48:48,105
Mila.

969
01:48:49,357 --> 01:48:51,567
My most beautiful child.

970
01:48:54,362 --> 01:48:55,404
Mother?

971
01:48:57,323 --> 01:48:58,783
Go home, Mila.

972
01:49:04,330 --> 01:49:08,209
Let's leave, Mother.

973
01:49:09,543 --> 01:49:11,379
I can't.

974
01:49:13,756 --> 01:49:17,134
Come home with me, Mother.

975
01:49:20,388 --> 01:49:21,931
I can't, Mil.

976
01:49:27,645 --> 01:49:29,480
Go home, Mila.

977
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:31,399
I can't, Mother.

978
01:49:35,820 --> 01:49:39,615
I cannot go home without you.

979
01:49:39,615 --> 01:49:41,117
You can, Mil.

980
01:49:43,119 --> 01:49:44,161
You can.

981
01:49:47,164 --> 01:49:50,584
I don't want you to be a part of this.

982
01:49:51,919 --> 01:49:53,546
Go home, Mila.

983
01:49:54,588 --> 01:49:55,923
You are strong.

984
01:49:57,550 --> 01:49:59,927
You have to live your life well.

985
01:49:59,927 --> 01:50:00,928
Remember...

986
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:04,890
never ever...

987
01:50:04,890 --> 01:50:08,978
Don't ever do what she wants you to do.

988
01:50:09,645 --> 01:50:10,855
Remember that, Mil.

989
01:50:28,539 --> 01:50:31,250
Mother... Mother...

990
01:50:36,922 --> 01:50:38,341
Mother...

991
01:50:39,842 --> 01:50:40,760
Mother!

992
01:50:46,432 --> 01:50:47,516
Mother!

993
01:50:57,360 --> 01:50:58,778
Mother.

994
01:51:16,212 --> 01:51:17,713
Don't you want...

995
01:51:18,839 --> 01:51:21,467
to accompany your mother here?

996
01:51:23,052 --> 01:51:26,472
Like... that girl?

997
01:51:40,778 --> 01:51:42,238
Mother!

998
01:51:44,698 --> 01:51:46,033
Mother!

999
01:51:52,248 --> 01:51:53,499
Mother...

1000
01:51:53,499 --> 01:51:55,709
Can you bear to see your mother like this?

1001
01:51:58,546 --> 01:51:59,964
Take pity on her.

1002
01:52:02,007 --> 01:52:03,092
Mil...

1003
01:52:03,092 --> 01:52:05,177
- Mila. Mil.
- Mila...

1004
01:52:05,845 --> 01:52:07,555
What's happening?

1005
01:52:07,555 --> 01:52:09,640
Her body is getting cold.

1006
01:52:09,640 --> 01:52:12,226
Help her. Mila.

1007
01:52:12,226 --> 01:52:13,853
Wait here.

1008
01:52:22,445 --> 01:52:23,988
- Mil!
- Mila!

1009
01:52:23,988 --> 01:52:24,989
Mila!

1010
01:52:40,254 --> 01:52:41,338
What is that?

1011
01:53:27,176 --> 01:53:28,928
Mother!

1012
01:53:28,928 --> 01:53:31,347
Don't!

1013
01:53:31,347 --> 01:53:32,640
Mother!

1014
01:53:35,351 --> 01:53:36,268
Mil?

1015
01:53:37,102 --> 01:53:38,062
Mila.

1016
01:53:45,986 --> 01:53:46,904
Mil...

1017
01:53:49,865 --> 01:53:51,617
Mother...

1018
01:53:53,869 --> 01:53:54,787
Mil!

1019
01:55:14,742 --> 01:55:15,659
Child...

1020
01:55:17,578 --> 01:55:22,708
You are the only dancer who came back

1021
01:55:22,708 --> 01:55:24,793
from Angkara Murka.

1022
01:55:30,966 --> 01:55:32,384
I was able to come back

1023
01:55:35,721 --> 01:55:36,930
because of my mother.

1024
01:55:42,186 --> 01:55:43,854
Excuse me, we have to leave.

1025
01:56:32,903 --> 01:56:34,530
Mother!

1026
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:55,259
Mother!

1027
01:57:06,437 --> 01:57:08,105
What should we do after this?

1028
01:57:10,816 --> 01:57:12,818
I don't know yet.

1029
01:57:15,154 --> 01:57:16,947
But one thing is for sure,

1030
01:57:16,947 --> 01:57:19,241
there shouldn't be any more victims.

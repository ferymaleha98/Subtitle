3
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:06,208
- You do this for a better life, right?
- Yes.

4
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:08,916
If God permits, I will help you.

5
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:11,416
Thank you.

6
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:28,083
Are you sure, Ning?

7
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:32,000
We can go, just the three of us.

8
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:34,791
Myself, you, and Nirmala.

9
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:40,291
Yes, I'm sure.

10
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:44,416
Sulaiman is a good man.

11
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,416
I just want you and Nirmala

12
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:53,916
to have a better life.

13
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:07,875
My ATM card got blocked.

14
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:09,875
You have cash, right?

15
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:11,500
Give me some.

16
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:13,750
I'll pay you back tomorrow.

17
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:16,708
Mom, I want to go home.

18
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:18,208
We'll be home soon.

19
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:24,791
{\an8}SEVERAL MONTHS LATER

20
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:28,000
{\an8}The Kungkum Kedung ritual
is what's been bringing us money, Ning.

21
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:30,208
As well as the blessings.

22
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:35,458
Everyone knows you're a fraud.

23
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:41,000
Don't become stupid like them!

24
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,458
People like us don't have
a lot of choices, Ning.

25
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:51,041
Come on.

26
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,375
- No.
- Let's move!

27
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:53,625
- No.
- Move!

28
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,583
- No.
- Come on!

29
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:56,500
No, no!

30
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,125
Come on!

31
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,750
Okay!

32
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,125
Okay. Okay.

33
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,875
But don't hurt Nirmala
and my mother ever again.

34
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:10,458
Come on.

35
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:26,708
If I lose consciousness,
pull the rope as hard as you can.

36
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:27,916
Got it?

37
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:16,375
{\an8}TWO WEEKS LATER

38
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:24,750
Later, I'm going to learn to make
origami again with Mr. Tetsuya.

39
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:29,333
What are you saying? Take it out.
You're going to get electrocuted.

40
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,166
Mala, don't put this in your mouth!

41
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,250
When you're with Granny later,
don't bother her too much.

42
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,875
Don't trouble her.

43
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,750
Don't trouble Mr. Tetsuya, too. Okay?

44
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,958
Mr. Tetsuya is actually very kind to me.

45
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:44,458
This is for you.

46
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,666
Mr. Tetsuya said that
an origami crane can...

47
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,208
What was it again, Granny?

48
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:53,083
They can bring fortune.

49
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,708
That's it.

50
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,375
Come on, hurry up.

51
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,375
I'm late for work.

52
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:02,500
Yes.

53
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,958
<i>My name is Mala.</i>

54
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,583
<i>My full name is Nirmala Aisyah.</i>

55
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:20,916
<i>Once that's done,</i>
<i>I really want to learn how to swim.</i>

56
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,958
<i>Why swim?</i>

57
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:27,125
<i>If you want to be a policewoman</i>
<i>you have to be able to swim.</i>

58
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:42,625
PROMO PRICE
RP 80,000

59
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:45,166
- Do you like it?
- Yes, I want this one.

60
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,291
<i>Stop, stop!</i>

61
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:52,208
Ning!

62
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,041
Ning!

63
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,208
Where's Sulaiman?

64
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,041
Where did he run off to?

65
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,375
Ask him to pay me back!

66
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,333
Stop it, Dad.

67
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:04,041
- He said, "One month!"
- Dad! People are watching.

68
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,375
That fake soldier! What a fraud!

69
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:09,583
I get it, but let's not make a scene here.

70
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:12,000
Husband and wife, you're both the same!

71
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,125
Stop it! You're embarrassing me.

72
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:17,166
How many months has it been?

73
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,375
Get in. It's about to rain. Quick.

74
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:22,666
Be careful. One by one.

75
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,375
Are you okay, Ning? You look pale.

76
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,541
You look sad.

77
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,250
I'm okay.

78
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,375
- Let's go home now.
- Yes.

79
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,541
Should we pick up your daughter
on the way?

80
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,458
That's okay.
I'll pick her up on my motorcycle.

81
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,166
But it's about to rain, Ning.

82
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:49,750
Yeah.

83
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:53,416
Can I come in late tomorrow?

84
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,375
I have to fix my motorcycle.

85
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,916
No problem, Ning.

86
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,791
What's wrong?

87
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,958
Where have you been?
What took you so long?

88
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:18,875
What's with her?

89
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,541
We'll talk later.
Let's go home now. Let's go.

90
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,000
What is wrong with you?

91
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:23,916
It hurts...

92
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,291
But it's raining, Mom.
Shouldn't we wait until the rain stops?

93
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,083
Let's just go home.

94
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,583
- What's wrong, Mala?
- It hurts, Mom.

95
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,333
It's okay, we're going home.

96
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,208
We'll talk about it later.

97
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:42,166
That's enough, Mala. Stop crying.

98
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:47,166
Next time,
I won't let you go with Uti Yah again.

99
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,458
Ning, go left.

100
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,708
The other way is too dangerous.

101
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,208
It's faster this way.

102
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,416
Ning! Are you sure?

103
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,125
- Mom!
- This is dangerous!

104
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,458
Be careful!

105
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,291
Nirmala?

106
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,333
Mother?

107
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,583
Mother?

108
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:11,958
Nirmala?

109
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,125
Ma'am.

110
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,708
{\an8}It's dangerous here, ma'am.

111
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:21,125
- I'm looking for my daughter.
- Find her later.

112
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,208
- My mother is missing, too.
- Yes.

113
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,125
Let's go up for now, ma'am.
It's dangerous here.

114
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:27,833
We're going up.

115
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,666
How did it happen?

116
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,208
MAJAKUNAN,
CENTRAL JAVA - RAINY SEASON 2022

117
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,125
- Sir.
- Yes, ma'am?

118
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:38,291
My daughter is still missing, sir.

119
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,125
Yes. We will take care of it.

120
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:41,791
- Arya!
- Yes, sir.

121
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,291
The girl is still missing.

122
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:48,041
She might have fallen into the river.
Call SAR immediately.

123
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,291
Hendro, come in.

124
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:54,083
There's still one victim
who has possibly fallen into the river.

125
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Uti Yah.

126
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:07,541
This is the grandmother.

127
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:11,208
The daughter hasn't been found.

128
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,000
Are you sure, Ning?

129
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:34,833
THE REDEMPTION OF SIN

130
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:40,583
Jump in.

131
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:47,416
I'm scared, Miss.

132
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,166
Let me ask you something.

133
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,166
How are you going to be a swimmer
if you're too scared of

134
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,958
getting in the water?

135
00:11:59,125 --> 00:11:59,958
Jump in.

136
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,458
I want to go home.

137
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,333
Let him go, Gus.

138
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:20,083
Miss, he is Mr. Wiro's son.

139
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:24,625
Head of the sectoral police.
He wants us to make him an athlete.

140
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,125
But he doesn't want to, Gus.

141
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:31,166
He already paid
for a year's worth of classes.

142
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:42,458
Okay.

143
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,250
Ready?

144
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,500
Tirta! Miss Tirta!

145
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:38,875
Life...

146
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,291
Water...

147
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:47,458
Life, water.

148
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:52,875
{\an8}Life. Water. Life. Water. Life.

149
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:59,541
<i>Life is like water in the river,</i>

150
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,958
<i>flowing unimpeded.</i>

151
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:05,958
<i>Unstoppable.</i>

152
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,625
<i>Until it reaches an estuary</i>

153
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,000
<i>and merges...</i>

154
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,333
<i>into the ocean.</i>

155
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:16,375
Mr. Adang!

156
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,583
Please tell them not to move yet.

157
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,500
They haven't checked that side.

158
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:24,708
Mrs. Wening, it's getting dark.
Go home and rest.

159
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:28,416
There are some areas there
that haven't been searched yet.

160
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,500
So why are you moving here?

161
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,666
Sir. Please accept this.

162
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,916
- I can't, ma'am. No.
- I want to ask,

163
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,875
is it not possible for the police to help
with the case?

164
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,750
Here's the thing, ma'am.
This is SAR's territory.

165
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:45,083
I'm sorry. I have to go.

166
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,500
<i>I know you're going through a hard time,</i>
<i>but I really need the money</i>

167
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,500
<i>for my husband's medical treatment.</i>

168
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:58,125
<i>If you want to extend the contract,</i>
<i>please pay the rent immediately.</i>

169
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,208
Soon. I promise.

170
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:01,958
<i>When are you going to pay?</i>

171
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,958
Soon.

172
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:07,541
<i>- Soon, please. I'll be waiting.</i>
- Yes.

173
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,833
Thank you, ma'am.

174
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,750
Here. This one is empty.

175
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:31,333
<i>Ning, starting from tomorrow</i>
<i>you don't have to come to work.</i>

176
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:36,500
When everything is settled,
you can come back.

177
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,416
I'm the one taking the loss.

178
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,791
You're not focused, Ning.

179
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,916
You're not doing the job right.

180
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49,416
You've ruined two clothes this week alone.

181
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,291
I wanted to help you out,

182
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,208
but why are you doing this?

183
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:15,541
<i>Next, let's not forget the foundation.</i>

184
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,833
{\an8}It's from eLGe Tech.

185
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:20,208
{\an8}This brand is really good.

186
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,666
{\an8}Look at this series.

187
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:27,916
This one is also important.

188
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,291
This eyeliner pencil is for the undereye.

189
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:46,000
We found items from the river yesterday.

190
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,666
There are clothes and shoes.

191
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:52,166
Please have a look.
Maybe you'll recognize something.

192
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,208
Recognize anything?

193
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,750
Someone said that Nirmala can swim.

194
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,000
I didn't know that.

195
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,666
- If she really can swim--
- Then where is she?

196
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:06,500
My daughter, Nirmala,
has been missing for a week.

197
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,166
{\an8}But I believe...

198
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,500
{\an8}Hoping you'll find guidance from God

199
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,125
{\an8}...that she will be found.

200
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,916
{\an8}God's warning, go and pray,
stop the livestream

201
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,833
Please pray for her.

202
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,125
Mom!

203
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,166
- What is this?
- Just open it.

204
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,625
Happy birthday, Mom.

205
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,500
So when you're live-streaming,

206
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,541
you don't have to put the phone
on the can of crackers.

207
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,250
Right.

208
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,541
Are you sure, Ning?

209
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:38,000
"Rest in peace."

210
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,625
What kind of peace?

211
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,666
Aren't you scared of being alone at home?

212
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,125
How much?

213
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:48,458
Ten thousand.

214
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:07,958
Sir.

215
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:18,458
Is this the woman
who died in the bridge accident?

216
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:19,708
Uti Yah.

217
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:22,041
That was Wening, her daughter.

218
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,583
She rode the motorcycle that night.

219
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:27,833
Her 11-year-old daughter, Nirmala,
is still missing.

220
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:30,125
Even if they find her,
she's probably dead.

221
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,958
Need to copy anything, Ms. Tirta?

222
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,041
Ten copies of this.

223
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:42,083
Another swimmer like you?

224
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,083
Let's hope.

225
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:46,000
Yeah, hope they'll become good.

226
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:50,000
They're only used to swimming
in the river, like villagers.

227
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:53,666
Well, I'm from the village
and I used to swim in the river, too.

228
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:56,291
Hey, this is her.

229
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:12,041
Tirta. The kids are ready.

230
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,041
<i>Listen up, everyone.</i>

231
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,875
Those who haven't paid
are not allowed to join.

232
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:20,625
Dodo, Ratih. Sit down.

233
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:22,666
The rest of you, go warm up.

234
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,166
Go. Warm up first.

235
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:26,625
Gus.

236
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:35,625
Miss. Miss.

237
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:38,875
A new kid who wants to join the class.

238
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:45,791
<i>Do you have your swimsuit?</i>

239
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:48,750
- No.
- No?

240
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:52,000
So are you going to swim in that dress?

241
00:22:57,875 --> 00:23:00,083
<i>The SAR team is still searching.</i>

242
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:03,916
<i>Confirmed by Adang Sutanto,</i>
<i>as the head of SAR operations,</i>

243
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,125
<i>they admitted the search was difficult</i>
<i>because of the strong river current.</i>

244
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:11,916
<i>With the available equipment,</i>
<i>the search hasn't been successful.</i>

245
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:16,875
Sir!

246
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:20,500
Sir! Where are you going?

247
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:24,125
Mr. Adang!

248
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:26,625
Sir, what is happening?

249
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:29,333
I'm sorry, ma'am.
We had to stop the search.

250
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:31,166
It's been ten days.

251
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,875
The chances of finding her now
are next to none.

252
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:37,291
We suspect that her body
has been carried far away.

253
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:39,625
My daughter is still alive.

254
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:42,625
She is not dead.

255
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,083
Who do you think you are?

256
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:48,625
God himself?

257
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:52,625
How can you determine someone's fate?

258
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:54,458
I'm sorry, ma'am.

259
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:58,500
But our decision is based on
rational and assessable facts.

260
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:43,750
<i>Hello. Good evening.</i>

261
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:47,541
<i>I don't know where else to ask for help.</i>

262
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:49,791
So I'm asking you.

263
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,416
My daughter is still missing.

264
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:58,208
The SAR team were looking for her.

265
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,166
But they stopped the search.

266
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:00,333
I'm sure...

267
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:05,875
my daughter is still alive out there.

268
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,583
Even if she's not...

269
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:18,875
I need to find...

270
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:23,416
her body.

271
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:08,625
<i>There...</i>

272
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:14,875
Good.

273
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:19,416
So, hey, you can teach me, yeah?

274
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:23,000
It's very good. Do you know the next step?

275
00:28:31,708 --> 00:28:34,916
- Thank you, Mr. Tetsuya.
- Thank you. See you soon.

276
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,833
Bye, bye.

277
00:28:35,916 --> 00:28:36,750
See you.

278
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:38,375
Andi.

279
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:40,541
Is there any space left?

280
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:41,500
Yes.

281
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:46,708
- Thank you, Mr. Tetsuya.
- Thank you. See you.

282
00:28:48,208 --> 00:28:49,541
- Take care.
- Yes.

283
00:28:51,291 --> 00:28:52,125
Bye, bye.

284
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:04,041
I've come to deliver your laundry.

285
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:07,166
I think my mother forgot to return it.

286
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:10,041
If I'm not mistaken,
she had to do your laundry at home

287
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:12,458
because the washing machine
here was broken.

288
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,416
Sorry, the fragrance
has probably gone by now.

289
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:27,750
I'm sorry I haven't thanked you sooner.

290
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:33,166
You came to the funeral
and helped with the cost.

291
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:47,000
- Daughter?
- Daughter.

292
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:54,208
I'm going, sir.

293
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:56,375
Oh, wait.

294
00:29:57,541 --> 00:29:58,625
How much should I...

295
00:30:00,708 --> 00:30:02,250
- pay for this?
- That's okay.

296
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,666
Besides, I no longer work
at the laundromat.

297
00:30:05,625 --> 00:30:06,458
I'm leaving.

298
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:21,291
I'm currently unemployed, sir.

299
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:26,041
Is it possible for me to work here
to replace my mother?

300
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,416
- Here?
- Yes.

301
00:30:31,666 --> 00:30:34,625
If you've already found
a replacement, that's fine.

302
00:30:41,916 --> 00:30:45,041
No, it's fine. I get it.
Thank you, sir. Please excuse me.

303
00:30:54,625 --> 00:30:55,458
Wening.

304
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:02,125
Can you start working tomorrow?

305
00:31:02,666 --> 00:31:03,541
Sure.

306
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,791
Like my mother did, Mr. Tetsuya?

307
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:12,708
Just call me Tetsuya.

308
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:16,708
All right, Tetsuya.

309
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,333
<i>Welcome to Tirta Today.</i>

310
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:37,083
Dissolving, unraveling,
awakening, strengthening.

311
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:43,375
In the previous episode,
we talked about...

312
00:31:44,541 --> 00:31:46,083
shattered dreams.

313
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,375
This time...

314
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:52,875
we will talk about...

315
00:31:55,291 --> 00:31:56,416
a tragedy.

316
00:32:02,916 --> 00:32:07,041
<i>No one ever plans</i>
<i>for when a tragedy strikes.</i>

317
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:12,750
<i>Everything that existed before...</i>

318
00:32:12,833 --> 00:32:16,750
<i>gone in an instant.</i>

319
00:32:19,666 --> 00:32:20,500
<i>Anger.</i>

320
00:32:22,291 --> 00:32:23,125
<i>Sadness.</i>

321
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,916
{\an8}<i>Disappointment.</i>

322
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:27,958
{\an8}<i>Regret.</i>

323
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:30,250
{\an8}<i>Emptiness.</i>

324
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:32,125
{\an8}IN PEACE

325
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:33,041
<i>Fear.</i>

326
00:32:33,916 --> 00:32:36,375
<i>They come crashing</i>
<i>like a storm over Mount Semeru.</i>

327
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:39,500
<i>I can sense it within you.</i>

328
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:44,875
<i>Right now, you are within the currents</i>
<i>of your new and winding life.</i>

329
00:32:46,291 --> 00:32:50,416
Please accept this, a gift from
Uti Yah's 7th day of remembrance.

330
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,833
Thank you.

331
00:32:52,916 --> 00:32:54,541
<i>Clear water turns murky.</i>

332
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:59,750
<i>Flowing toward an unknown estuary.</i>

333
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:05,000
<i>Is your estuary a tragedy?</i>

334
00:33:07,791 --> 00:33:11,916
<i>Is the current that drags you</i>
<i>the comedy of life,</i>

335
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:16,125
<i>enthusiastically teasing you</i>
<i>to laugh heartily,</i>

336
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:20,375
<i>forgetting all of your sorrows?</i>

337
00:33:57,875 --> 00:33:58,708
Nirmala?

338
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:03,875
Nirmala?

339
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:30,875
Nirmala?

340
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,250
Ma'am.

341
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,916
Be careful. It's slippery.

342
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,375
<i>Wening is interesting, Gus.</i>

343
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:57,000
Interesting enough
to be your content, right?

344
00:34:59,291 --> 00:35:00,125
Gus.

345
00:35:01,416 --> 00:35:04,958
I want to invite her as a guest
on my podcast.

346
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,375
- What do you think?
- I guarantee it's going to go viral.

347
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:11,250
Viral.

348
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:15,500
Problem is, does she want to be in it?

349
00:35:49,541 --> 00:35:50,375
Excuse me.

350
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:52,875
Mrs. Wening?

351
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:16,208
Mrs. Wening?

352
00:36:19,041 --> 00:36:19,958
Mrs. Wening?

353
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:48,583
Mrs. Wening?

354
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,875
Mrs. Wening?

355
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:14,083
I'm sorry, ma'am.

356
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:21,333
Who are you?

357
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:49,416
Her name is Miyako.

358
00:39:51,208 --> 00:39:52,041
Miyako?

359
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:17,875
May I?

360
00:40:40,916 --> 00:40:42,375
- Hope.
- Hope?

361
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:57,041
- A thousand?
- A thousand.

362
00:40:57,125 --> 00:40:59,916
A thousand cranes.

363
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:03,375
- Hopes.
- A thousand cranes of hopes.

364
00:41:14,833 --> 00:41:16,166
How do I say it...

365
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:27,583
<i>A strong bond.</i>

366
00:41:28,958 --> 00:41:32,958
A mother surely has
a strong bond with her daughter.

367
00:41:47,208 --> 00:41:49,333
Sulaiman. He's a fraud.

368
00:41:49,416 --> 00:41:50,708
That fake soldier.

369
00:41:50,791 --> 00:41:53,208
He has tricked many people.

370
00:41:53,291 --> 00:41:56,500
Fake investment schemes
and phony job offers in Taiwan.

371
00:41:56,583 --> 00:41:58,875
He never paid his debt to Lastri.

372
00:41:59,625 --> 00:42:00,625
And the list goes on.

373
00:42:01,666 --> 00:42:02,625
Where is he now?

374
00:42:03,625 --> 00:42:05,250
No idea. Probably ran away.

375
00:42:05,333 --> 00:42:07,250
Nobody truly knows.

376
00:42:07,666 --> 00:42:09,666
He left his debts and unresolved problems

377
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:12,041
and left Mrs. Wening
to deal with everything.

378
00:42:12,916 --> 00:42:15,541
That man is useless. He's a jerk.

379
00:42:17,083 --> 00:42:19,083
She has so many problems.

380
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:24,416
The more problems she has,
the more fun the podcast, right?

381
00:42:31,041 --> 00:42:33,958
Mr. Tetsuya. The food is ready.

382
00:42:36,416 --> 00:42:37,291
What is it?

383
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:39,500
The food is ready, Mr. Tetsuya.

384
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,333
Sir.

385
00:43:23,375 --> 00:43:25,666
- I want those papers.
- Which paper?

386
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,625
That one. The one on top.

387
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:29,083
Yes.

388
00:43:35,708 --> 00:43:36,583
Miss.

389
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:43,583
Hi, Mrs. Wening.

390
00:43:49,333 --> 00:43:51,666
So I can talk about anything
on your podcast?

391
00:43:52,583 --> 00:43:53,458
Sure.

392
00:43:54,458 --> 00:43:56,458
- Am I allowed to protest?
- You can.

393
00:44:04,958 --> 00:44:07,291
- When?
- Whenever you're available.

394
00:44:10,541 --> 00:44:12,166
I need a thousand origami cranes.

395
00:44:12,541 --> 00:44:13,875
If you can help me,

396
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:16,875
I'll do the interview.

397
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:22,041
Okay, ma'am.

398
00:44:32,291 --> 00:44:33,541
Mrs. Wening.

399
00:44:34,416 --> 00:44:36,083
I'm sorry, I have to go now.

400
00:44:36,166 --> 00:44:37,666
I'll leave you both here.

401
00:44:40,416 --> 00:44:41,833
Please excuse me, ma'am.

402
00:44:47,708 --> 00:44:48,666
It's like this.

403
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:51,833
<i>Okay? It is difficult</i>
<i>if you're not used to it,</i>

404
00:44:51,916 --> 00:44:54,750
<i>but you will get the hang of it.</i>

405
00:44:55,416 --> 00:44:58,500
<i>The origami crane is not only beautiful,</i>

406
00:44:58,583 --> 00:45:01,375
<i>it can also be a symbol of hope,</i>

407
00:45:01,458 --> 00:45:03,125
<i>a symbol of luck.</i>

408
00:45:03,208 --> 00:45:05,291
<i>So, let's continue.</i>

409
00:45:06,333 --> 00:45:09,833
<i>The next step</i>
<i>is to make the triangle base.</i>

410
00:45:09,916 --> 00:45:11,000
<i>Fold it like this.</i>

411
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,916
Is that your husband in that photo?

412
00:45:13,666 --> 00:45:18,291
<i>...by following the diagonal fold</i>
<i>we made earlier. Okay?</i>

413
00:45:18,375 --> 00:45:19,875
<i>Next, we'll make the...</i>

414
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:26,708
<i>...meet at the top part.</i>

415
00:45:27,166 --> 00:45:30,500
<i>Okay. Let's continue.</i>
<i>Fold the sides to the middle with...</i>

416
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:32,833
Here.

417
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,208
<i>...facing upward. There you go.</i>

418
00:45:35,291 --> 00:45:39,125
<i>Then we fold the two sides again</i>
<i>so that...</i>

419
00:45:39,208 --> 00:45:40,041
Ma'am.

420
00:45:42,208 --> 00:45:43,458
I admire you, ma'am.

421
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:47,625
You are strong, resilient,
facing this tragedy on your own.

422
00:45:48,708 --> 00:45:49,625
You're amazing.

423
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:51,833
I don't have a choice.

424
00:45:56,625 --> 00:45:57,625
Let me do it.

425
00:45:59,375 --> 00:46:01,708
- You can make the cranes.
- Sure.

426
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,500
<i>Are you sure, Ning?</i>

427
00:46:56,916 --> 00:46:59,125
<i>Are you sure, Ning?</i>

428
00:47:02,375 --> 00:47:04,000
<i>Are you sure, Ning?</i>

429
00:47:05,666 --> 00:47:06,958
<i>Are you sure, Ning?</i>

430
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:11,750
<i>Are you sure, Ning?</i>

431
00:47:21,208 --> 00:47:23,166
<i>Are you sure, Ning?</i>

432
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,541
<i>Are you sure, Ning?</i>

433
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:37,375
<i>Are you sure, Ning?</i>

434
00:47:39,333 --> 00:47:41,625
<i>Are you sure, Ning?</i>

435
00:47:44,875 --> 00:47:46,083
<i>Are you...</i>

436
00:47:48,041 --> 00:47:49,333
<i>Are you sure, Ning?</i>

437
00:47:56,208 --> 00:47:59,166
Are you sure, Ning?

438
00:48:10,375 --> 00:48:11,208
Ma'am?

439
00:48:16,416 --> 00:48:17,250
Ma'am?

440
00:48:19,833 --> 00:48:20,708
Ma'am?

441
00:48:38,375 --> 00:48:39,208
Ma'am?

442
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:54,083
<i>Mrs. Wening.</i>

443
00:48:54,958 --> 00:48:59,041
Do you really believe that these cranes...

444
00:49:02,041 --> 00:49:03,916
- can help you find...
- It doesn't matter

445
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,500
what I believe or not, Tirta.

446
00:49:11,583 --> 00:49:15,583
I'm not a saint, Tirta.

447
00:49:17,375 --> 00:49:19,166
I have sinned.

448
00:49:26,458 --> 00:49:29,083
<i>Nirmala gives me hope that there is</i>

449
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,708
finally a decent person in my family.

450
00:50:09,333 --> 00:50:11,416
Have you been recording me?

451
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,833
Yes, ma'am.

452
00:50:16,958 --> 00:50:19,208
I don't like being recorded like that.

453
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,791
I'm sorry. I'll delete the recordings.

454
00:50:35,958 --> 00:50:37,458
Tirta, thank you.

455
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:41,458
I'll pick you up for the interview
later this evening.

456
00:50:42,041 --> 00:50:42,875
Okay.

457
00:51:13,833 --> 00:51:15,458
<i>Actually, the gap is clear.</i>

458
00:51:16,125 --> 00:51:18,041
Your intention is to help her.

459
00:51:18,125 --> 00:51:20,958
That's true. But making her
a guest star is not enough.

460
00:51:21,041 --> 00:51:22,708
- We need concrete proof.
- Thanks.

461
00:51:22,791 --> 00:51:24,000
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Yeah.

462
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:27,708
I can introduce her to Mbah Gowa.

463
00:51:29,083 --> 00:51:29,958
Mbah Gowa?

464
00:51:32,125 --> 00:51:36,125
Mbah Gowa is the one who helped
Mr. Wiro find the terrorist hideout.

465
00:51:36,958 --> 00:51:38,833
- Is he a shaman?
- Yes.

466
00:51:38,916 --> 00:51:41,375
The police hunts terrorists
with a shaman's help?

467
00:51:41,458 --> 00:51:42,291
Yes.

468
00:51:43,791 --> 00:51:45,541
They used the Internet, too.

469
00:51:45,625 --> 00:51:48,791
Do you think she'll be
interested in black magic?

470
00:51:48,875 --> 00:51:51,041
Even a God-fearing person

471
00:51:51,125 --> 00:51:55,708
might resort to black magic
when she's desperate.

472
00:51:56,375 --> 00:51:58,625
You just need to convince her.

473
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:13,916
- Interesting.
- Of course.

474
00:52:19,333 --> 00:52:20,166
Wening.

475
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:22,166
You don't need to clean that over there.

476
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
There are a lot of ants here.

477
00:52:56,083 --> 00:52:57,291
They're so annoying.

478
00:53:00,458 --> 00:53:03,833
Some ant species
can actually get into the roots.

479
00:53:04,875 --> 00:53:06,791
They gnaw it and kill the plant.

480
00:53:11,666 --> 00:53:13,750
That makes my work in vain.

481
00:53:25,833 --> 00:53:26,666
Enough.

482
00:54:06,041 --> 00:54:07,416
- Wait, ma'am.
- Okay.

483
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:24,416
- Please come in.
- Thank you.

484
00:54:31,541 --> 00:54:33,125
You're from Jakarta.

485
00:54:34,916 --> 00:54:36,958
Why did you move to a small town?

486
00:54:37,541 --> 00:54:38,416
I ran away.

487
00:54:39,125 --> 00:54:41,250
I failed as an athlete after an accident.

488
00:54:41,916 --> 00:54:45,458
Well, this life is enough for me now.

489
00:54:48,458 --> 00:54:49,750
Some people say that.

490
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:54,458
You don't need to be afraid and hide.

491
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:58,958
And you don't need to be scared
when you've done nothing wrong.

492
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:02,875
The accident wasn't
really your fault, right?

493
00:55:04,458 --> 00:55:05,708
It was my own fault.

494
00:55:12,333 --> 00:55:15,250
<i>Welcome to Tirta Today.</i>

495
00:55:15,333 --> 00:55:19,375
<i>Dissolving. Unraveling.</i>
<i>Awakening. Strengthening.</i>

496
00:55:19,458 --> 00:55:23,708
<i>In this episode,</i>
<i>we have an amazing guest star,</i>

497
00:55:23,791 --> 00:55:26,958
<i>a woman who has faced</i>

498
00:55:27,041 --> 00:55:30,916
<i>the biggest tragedy in her life.</i>

499
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:39,916
Is it true that Nirmala is still
nowhere to be found since that night?

500
00:55:40,666 --> 00:55:41,500
Yes.

501
00:55:42,125 --> 00:55:45,375
Wasn't there a SAR team
who searched for Nirmala?

502
00:55:46,958 --> 00:55:49,666
There was,

503
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:53,208
but they stopped the search because...

504
00:55:54,666 --> 00:56:00,041
they believed Nirmala to be dead.

505
00:56:08,958 --> 00:56:11,000
How are you so sure...

506
00:56:13,458 --> 00:56:15,250
that Nirmala is still alive?

507
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:32,125
Ma'am, what if we ask a shaman to help us?

508
00:56:35,541 --> 00:56:39,625
I thought, maybe if you believe in
the power of those origami cranes,

509
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:42,083
it wouldn't hurt to try.

510
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,333
Who?

511
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:57,458
Ms. Tirta. Miss.

512
00:57:06,208 --> 00:57:07,041
Mrs. Wening.

513
00:57:11,041 --> 00:57:12,166
Let's go.

514
00:57:25,166 --> 00:57:26,000
Mbah Gowa.

515
00:57:26,708 --> 00:57:28,708
- Yes?
- She's here, Mbah.

516
00:57:32,625 --> 00:57:34,583
<i>For seven days</i>

517
00:57:34,666 --> 00:57:38,416
after leaving the physical body,

518
00:57:39,625 --> 00:57:44,000
the soul remains trapped
in an unfamiliar realm.

519
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:49,041
On the 8th day, stronger spirits

520
00:57:49,125 --> 00:57:51,875
can break free from the unknown realm.

521
00:57:51,958 --> 00:57:53,375
Slow down.

522
00:57:53,458 --> 00:57:56,416
They are free to travel anywhere

523
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,458
until the 40th day.

524
00:58:00,916 --> 00:58:03,041
Your daughter, Nirmala.

525
00:58:04,958 --> 00:58:07,166
She is in a dark place now.

526
00:58:09,333 --> 00:58:11,125
Do you mean she's still alive?

527
00:58:11,833 --> 00:58:14,083
There's another force holding her,

528
00:58:14,166 --> 00:58:17,375
preventing her
from leaving that dark place.

529
00:58:22,875 --> 00:58:25,416
It's your sin from the past.

530
00:58:26,416 --> 00:58:28,125
Redeem your sin,

531
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:31,000
and she might be free.

532
00:58:37,416 --> 00:58:38,875
What sin?

533
00:58:41,833 --> 00:58:47,416
What came to your mind
when I said, "Redeem your sin"?

534
00:58:59,083 --> 00:59:00,375
<i>Are you sure, Ning?</i>

535
00:59:16,583 --> 00:59:17,833
- Nirmala?
- Yes.

536
00:59:22,583 --> 00:59:24,041
I need to go to Cirebon.

537
00:59:24,666 --> 00:59:26,958
May I have my salary in advance?

538
00:59:27,041 --> 00:59:29,916
- Okay, just wait a moment.
- Thank you.

539
00:59:34,958 --> 00:59:36,458
<i>He seems nice.</i>

540
00:59:37,833 --> 00:59:38,833
Yes, he's kind.

541
00:59:39,916 --> 00:59:42,791
He has a daughter back in Japan.
He's divorced.

542
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Tirta.

543
00:59:55,166 --> 00:59:56,416
- Let's go.
- Okay.

544
01:00:08,166 --> 01:00:09,791
You can't go alone.

545
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,125
I'll come with you.

546
01:00:25,708 --> 01:00:27,375
How is the situation, Cak?

547
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:31,125
- Can we go to work today or tomorrow?
- How's it?

548
01:00:31,708 --> 01:00:34,250
I'll fill this up first.
Get it back tomorrow.

549
01:00:34,333 --> 01:00:37,583
<i>What I did to him...</i>

550
01:00:40,125 --> 01:00:42,083
is probably my greatest sin.

551
01:00:59,833 --> 01:01:00,666
Wening.

552
01:01:02,583 --> 01:01:04,125
Ning, where are you going?

553
01:01:04,208 --> 01:01:08,708
I thought marrying you would improve
my life and lead to a brighter future.

554
01:01:08,791 --> 01:01:11,291
But now I see that I married
a middle school student

555
01:01:11,375 --> 01:01:12,833
who's obsessed with racing.

556
01:01:12,916 --> 01:01:15,166
Ning, I've told you a million times.

557
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:18,583
I've worked really hard for you
but it's never enough for you.

558
01:01:18,666 --> 01:01:22,333
What? I had to work on my own
to fulfill my needs.

559
01:01:22,416 --> 01:01:25,583
Now, I'm taking care of myself,
my daughter, and my mother.

560
01:01:25,666 --> 01:01:28,958
Just take care of your racing
and your ill mother.

561
01:01:31,083 --> 01:01:33,708
I have never once talked badly
about your mom.

562
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:37,333
Just stay here with me, honey.

563
01:01:38,708 --> 01:01:40,750
- Sorry, Wicak. Uti Yah.
- Ning.

564
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:42,166
Ning.

565
01:01:45,083 --> 01:01:46,208
Ning.

566
01:02:03,125 --> 01:02:05,041
He's actually a good man.

567
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:39,625
ABANDONED BY WIFE, HUSBAND BURNS HIMSELF

568
01:02:44,333 --> 01:02:46,708
- Yes, this way, ma'am.
- Thank you, ma'am.

569
01:02:48,208 --> 01:02:49,833
Tirta, wait here for a bit.

570
01:02:56,791 --> 01:03:00,125
<i>Two weeks ago, he tried to kill himself.</i>

571
01:03:02,208 --> 01:03:04,458
<i>But that was not the first time.</i>

572
01:03:04,541 --> 01:03:08,250
He had made multiple attempts before.

573
01:03:11,625 --> 01:03:12,458
Come in.

574
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:59,125
Wicak, I had a motorcycle accident.

575
01:04:01,583 --> 01:04:03,083
Uti Yah didn't make it.

576
01:04:05,958 --> 01:04:07,416
Nirmala...

577
01:04:09,666 --> 01:04:11,458
is still missing in the river.

578
01:04:14,916 --> 01:04:18,958
Nirmala.

579
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,625
But I am sure she is still alive, Wicak.

580
01:04:32,208 --> 01:04:34,416
I came here to apologize.

581
01:04:39,875 --> 01:04:41,958
I have made you like this.

582
01:04:44,791 --> 01:04:46,333
My greatest sin seems to be...

583
01:04:47,791 --> 01:04:49,625
why Nirmala is still missing.

584
01:04:58,791 --> 01:05:00,625
Kill...

585
01:05:02,833 --> 01:05:04,791
me.

586
01:05:13,583 --> 01:05:16,000
I...

587
01:05:18,291 --> 01:05:19,875
will...

588
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:23,208
forgive...

589
01:05:24,583 --> 01:05:25,916
you...

590
01:05:28,708 --> 01:05:31,041
if...

591
01:05:32,416 --> 01:05:33,791
you...

592
01:05:35,458 --> 01:05:36,916
kill...

593
01:05:38,583 --> 01:05:40,250
me.

594
01:05:47,833 --> 01:05:51,958
The pillow...

595
01:06:18,625 --> 01:06:19,500
I can't!

596
01:06:34,291 --> 01:06:36,166
Help!

597
01:06:37,541 --> 01:06:41,500
Help!

598
01:06:41,583 --> 01:06:42,416
Help!

599
01:06:43,125 --> 01:06:45,291
Help!

600
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:47,750
Help!

601
01:06:47,833 --> 01:06:49,083
What's wrong, ma'am?

602
01:06:49,875 --> 01:06:52,166
Oh, my God!

603
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:54,166
What happened, ma'am?

604
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:55,708
Mr. Marno! Help!

605
01:06:55,791 --> 01:06:57,541
What happened, ma'am?

606
01:06:57,625 --> 01:06:59,041
He bit his own tongue!

607
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:26,666
Ma'am.

608
01:07:29,208 --> 01:07:30,041
Tirta.

609
01:07:31,666 --> 01:07:33,916
You've helped me a lot.

610
01:07:35,041 --> 01:07:35,875
Go home now.

611
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:46,083
<i>This isn't interesting anymore.</i>

612
01:07:47,625 --> 01:07:49,208
<i>This is tragic, Gus.</i>

613
01:07:51,458 --> 01:07:53,708
<i>She went to see her ex-husband.</i>

614
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:55,458
Wicak.

615
01:07:56,333 --> 01:07:57,958
Her first husband.

616
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:09,125
Tell Mbah Gowa that she is serious

617
01:08:09,208 --> 01:08:11,416
about seeking redemption for her sin.

618
01:08:14,458 --> 01:08:16,625
Hello, my darlings.

619
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:21,125
I hope it's true what you said
about Mbah Gowa, Gus.

620
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:25,333
That he can help her find Nirmala.

621
01:08:26,625 --> 01:08:32,041
I'd like to show you
how to achieve a natural look.

622
01:08:34,083 --> 01:08:38,458
<i>Striving for viral content</i>
<i>doesn't mean anything anymore.</i>

623
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,791
I'll show you, my darlings.

624
01:09:09,583 --> 01:09:15,500
Use a generous amount
and tap your face with it to moisturize.

625
01:10:19,333 --> 01:10:21,625
Mr. Tetsuya. Are you home?

626
01:10:24,583 --> 01:10:25,750
Mr. Tetsuya.

627
01:10:43,583 --> 01:10:46,541
Mr. Tetsuya, I'm sorry
to bother you this late.

628
01:10:46,625 --> 01:10:50,208
May I stay here tonight?
I can't stay at my house.

629
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:55,375
- Okay.
- Thank you.

630
01:11:07,083 --> 01:11:08,000
Mr. Tetsuya.

631
01:11:13,416 --> 01:11:17,125
Do you believe in ghosts?

632
01:11:48,333 --> 01:11:49,833
Thank you, Mr. Tetsuya.

633
01:11:50,708 --> 01:11:51,750
You're welcome.

634
01:12:04,958 --> 01:12:05,791
Wening.

635
01:12:07,583 --> 01:12:09,500
I don't believe in ghosts.

636
01:12:18,875 --> 01:12:20,541
<i>I believe in...</i>

637
01:12:21,375 --> 01:12:23,500
<i>the tangible realities before me.</i>

638
01:12:24,708 --> 01:12:26,291
<i>No ghost can disturb me.</i>

639
01:12:27,666 --> 01:12:29,791
<i>Things that disturb me are ants,</i>

640
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,500
<i>and the memories of my daughter.</i>

641
01:12:57,375 --> 01:12:59,916
Mom, I want to go home.

642
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,208
We'll be home soon.

643
01:13:01,291 --> 01:13:04,166
- Let's go home.
- What happened, Mala?

644
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:07,458
Mom! This is Mala, Mom!

645
01:13:07,541 --> 01:13:09,666
It's Mala, Mom!

646
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:14,166
Help me, Mom! Help Mala!

647
01:13:22,958 --> 01:13:26,875
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

648
01:13:26,958 --> 01:13:30,541
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

649
01:13:30,791 --> 01:13:36,375
<i>Happy birthday, dear Miyako</i>

650
01:13:36,916 --> 01:13:40,458
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

651
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:41,583
Wening.

652
01:14:00,083 --> 01:14:02,875
<i>Please prepare some snacks for the kids.</i>

653
01:14:03,541 --> 01:14:07,000
<i>I want them to join Miyako's</i>
<i>birthday celebration today.</i>

654
01:14:07,083 --> 01:14:08,458
All right, Mr. Tetsuya.

655
01:14:09,875 --> 01:14:11,125
Mrs. Wening!

656
01:14:14,875 --> 01:14:15,833
Ma'am.

657
01:14:23,833 --> 01:14:24,916
What is it, Tirta?

658
01:14:26,833 --> 01:14:28,875
They found a dead body.

659
01:14:36,208 --> 01:14:42,125
- The legs, the body.
- It doesn't smell, sir

660
01:14:42,208 --> 01:14:44,833
- It doesn't smell.
- Look.

661
01:14:44,916 --> 01:14:47,875
It's swollen. The leg.

662
01:14:53,791 --> 01:14:55,375
Open it.

663
01:15:05,041 --> 01:15:06,166
It's not Nirmala.

664
01:15:18,375 --> 01:15:19,791
What is Mbah Gowa doing here?

665
01:15:20,583 --> 01:15:21,958
I don't know.

666
01:15:22,041 --> 01:15:25,500
When they found a dead body,
Mbah Gowa asked me

667
01:15:25,583 --> 01:15:27,583
to take him to Mrs. Wening immediately.

668
01:15:31,333 --> 01:15:34,208
You redeemed the wrong sin.

669
01:15:35,583 --> 01:15:39,250
You know whose body that is, don't you?

670
01:15:52,416 --> 01:15:53,583
<i>I had to let go.</i>

671
01:15:53,666 --> 01:15:56,166
Otherwise, I would have drowned, too.

672
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,875
It's obvious now. He's the one
who's been keeping Nirmala captive.

673
01:16:01,958 --> 01:16:03,500
Then what should I do now?

674
01:16:04,083 --> 01:16:07,791
Don't ask me to apologize, let alone
beg for mercy before that man's body.

675
01:16:07,875 --> 01:16:09,416
It will never happen.

676
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:11,458
Mbah Gowa, he hurt me.

677
01:16:11,541 --> 01:16:14,208
He hurt my mother, Uti Yah, and Nirmala.

678
01:16:16,958 --> 01:16:20,958
You must perform
a river purification ceremony.

679
01:16:22,208 --> 01:16:25,875
The ritual will compel Sulaiman's spirit

680
01:16:25,958 --> 01:16:30,250
to release Nirmala from his grip.

681
01:16:35,333 --> 01:16:36,416
Gus.

682
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:38,625
- Yes, ma'am?
- Please help Mbah Gowa.

683
01:16:38,708 --> 01:16:41,791
Help him prepare
a purification ceremony by the river.

684
01:16:41,875 --> 01:16:45,500
Okay. What do you need, ma'am?

685
01:16:45,583 --> 01:16:46,916
{\an8}- A Javanese goat.
- Yes.

686
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,750
{\an8}A black male goat. And tumpeng rice.

687
01:16:49,833 --> 01:16:50,833
Let me help you.

688
01:16:55,125 --> 01:16:57,250
Gather as many people as you can.

689
01:16:57,333 --> 01:17:00,625
Clear the site of the accident.
The ceremony will be held there.

690
01:17:04,958 --> 01:17:07,958
Mr. Tetsuya. This is my friend, Tirta.

691
01:17:37,875 --> 01:17:41,416
It's a training method, sir.
I want them to be brave enough to--

692
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:42,750
Including Nirmala.

693
01:17:45,125 --> 01:17:45,958
Nirmala?

694
01:17:49,708 --> 01:17:52,625
It's not like that, sir.
Nirmala actually wants to swim.

695
01:17:53,250 --> 01:17:57,625
Wait, you never told me that
Nirmala took your swimming class.

696
01:18:02,541 --> 01:18:04,416
Yes, she went once.

697
01:18:06,250 --> 01:18:07,583
This man dropped her off.

698
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:09,958
Even if Nirmala can swim--

699
01:18:10,041 --> 01:18:14,333
You also never told me that
you've met Nirmala before.

700
01:18:15,958 --> 01:18:18,375
- Listen.
- What else are you hiding, Tirta?

701
01:18:22,541 --> 01:18:24,416
Don't come near me ever again.

702
01:18:27,375 --> 01:18:28,208
Leave.

703
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:50,583
Yes.

704
01:18:54,666 --> 01:18:59,541
Mr. Tetsuya, can I ask you
for one more favor?

705
01:19:25,333 --> 01:19:26,750
The connection...

706
01:19:26,833 --> 01:19:28,000
Gus! Ragus!

707
01:19:29,083 --> 01:19:30,458
See you.

708
01:19:32,708 --> 01:19:33,583
Where's Mbah Gowa?

709
01:19:35,083 --> 01:19:37,541
Sorry, Miss. You're not allowed to get in.

710
01:19:38,083 --> 01:19:38,958
Why?

711
01:19:39,708 --> 01:19:40,833
You're a woman.

712
01:19:41,291 --> 01:19:45,083
Women are not allowed
to attend the ritual. It's only for men.

713
01:19:45,833 --> 01:19:46,958
You're kidding me.

714
01:19:47,833 --> 01:19:48,916
I'm dead serious.

715
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,416
Mbah Gowa warned us,

716
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:53,375
a woman's presence
will make this ceremony pointless.

717
01:20:27,333 --> 01:20:29,291
You should go home now.

718
01:20:30,375 --> 01:20:32,250
I'll update you on the results.

719
01:20:32,833 --> 01:20:35,875
- It'll work this time.
- Thank you.

720
01:21:03,833 --> 01:21:09,041
Nirmala must be so proud
to have a mother like you.

721
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:16,875
Maybe...

722
01:21:18,166 --> 01:21:21,166
I should've learned from you...

723
01:21:23,625 --> 01:21:25,916
on how to make peace with my loss.

724
01:22:34,708 --> 01:22:35,791
Thank you.

725
01:23:38,750 --> 01:23:43,958
Nirmala!

726
01:23:47,375 --> 01:23:51,083
Nirmala!

727
01:23:53,416 --> 01:23:54,583
Nirmala!

728
01:23:56,833 --> 01:23:57,875
Nirmala!

729
01:24:07,958 --> 01:24:09,250
Nirmala!

730
01:24:14,333 --> 01:24:16,166
Nirmala!

731
01:24:26,083 --> 01:24:31,416
Hey! We found her!

732
01:24:32,208 --> 01:24:36,208
She's here! Here! Here!

733
01:25:03,833 --> 01:25:05,208
I'm scared, Gus.

734
01:25:13,125 --> 01:25:16,291
Your sins are too heavy, Wening.

735
01:25:17,958 --> 01:25:19,833
They cannot be redeemed.

736
01:25:20,875 --> 01:25:23,333
They cannot be cleansed.

737
01:25:25,333 --> 01:25:30,125
Nirmala's loss is
the only just punishment for you.

738
01:25:32,833 --> 01:25:39,250
No one can help you find Nirmala.

739
01:25:41,458 --> 01:25:42,541
Unless...

740
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,583
Where is Nirmala?

741
01:27:16,166 --> 01:27:17,916
She's with you, right?

742
01:27:19,875 --> 01:27:20,916
Where is she?

743
01:27:27,041 --> 01:27:31,458
{\an8}Uti Yah, please forgive me.

744
01:27:32,958 --> 01:27:37,458
{\an8}Wicak, please forgive me.

745
01:27:41,291 --> 01:27:46,125
{\an8}Nirmala, please forgive me.

746
01:27:48,583 --> 01:27:52,166
<i>No one can help you find Nirmala.</i>

747
01:27:52,916 --> 01:27:53,958
Unless...

748
01:27:56,333 --> 01:27:57,833
you follow her.

749
01:28:49,583 --> 01:28:52,416
<i>He has a daughter back in Japan.</i>
<i>He's divorced.</i>

750
01:29:23,625 --> 01:29:25,791
FATAL ACCIDENT IN KASUMIGAURA.
MURDER-SUICIDE BY FATHER?

751
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:31,250
{\an8}FATHER PLEADS NOT GUILTY.

752
01:29:48,375 --> 01:29:49,291
Gus.

753
01:29:50,625 --> 01:29:52,166
We should see Mrs. Wening.

754
01:29:54,625 --> 01:29:59,125
Finally, Sulaiman's debt
has been paid off.

755
01:29:59,208 --> 01:30:02,083
Your son, Ragus.

756
01:30:02,166 --> 01:30:05,083
He is incredible.

757
01:30:05,166 --> 01:30:07,291
You are the one who is incredible.

758
01:30:07,375 --> 01:30:10,458
That redemption of sin idea.

759
01:30:12,750 --> 01:30:13,625
Keep talking.

760
01:30:17,125 --> 01:30:18,041
Keep laughing.

761
01:30:24,458 --> 01:30:26,958
Turns out, you three are frauds.

762
01:30:30,625 --> 01:30:31,458
Keep laughing.

763
01:30:32,875 --> 01:30:33,708
Talk.

764
01:30:36,125 --> 01:30:37,125
Bastards.

765
01:30:45,333 --> 01:30:46,166
Get down.

766
01:30:57,375 --> 01:30:58,375
Okay.

767
01:30:58,458 --> 01:30:59,583
Take care, Uncle.

768
01:31:01,041 --> 01:31:03,375
I can introduce Wening to Mbah Gowa.

769
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:05,500
You just need to convince her.

770
01:31:09,125 --> 01:31:13,500
Please tell Mbah Gowa that she is serious
about seeking redemption for her sin.

771
01:31:29,416 --> 01:31:30,625
You're insane.

772
01:31:31,208 --> 01:31:32,041
Bastard!

773
01:31:50,583 --> 01:31:51,583
Ma'am.

774
01:31:52,166 --> 01:31:53,333
Mrs. Wening.

775
01:31:54,291 --> 01:31:55,125
Ma'am.

776
01:31:56,958 --> 01:32:00,041
I know you are still mad at me.
I want to apologize.

777
01:32:03,083 --> 01:32:04,250
Mr. Tetsuya.

778
01:32:06,208 --> 01:32:07,250
I just realized.

779
01:32:09,083 --> 01:32:13,250
Tirta said you took Nirmala
to her swimming class.

780
01:32:14,291 --> 01:32:15,125
Is that true?

781
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:34,833
Thank you.

782
01:32:42,708 --> 01:32:44,083
Open the door, please.

783
01:32:45,708 --> 01:32:46,541
Ma'am.

784
01:32:47,375 --> 01:32:48,208
Mrs. Wening.

785
01:32:48,791 --> 01:32:50,916
I want to help you find Nirmala.

786
01:32:52,583 --> 01:32:54,833
You haven't answered my question.

787
01:33:13,083 --> 01:33:15,541
<i>The first time Uti Yah brought</i>
<i>Nirmala here...</i>

788
01:33:17,625 --> 01:33:18,916
<i>I felt very calm.</i>

789
01:33:23,458 --> 01:33:26,750
<i>I never expected that she would look</i>
<i>a lot like Miyako.</i>

790
01:33:37,666 --> 01:33:38,875
Mr. Tetsuya.

791
01:33:40,291 --> 01:33:43,125
The dress fits perfectly.
Thank you, Mr. Tetsuya.

792
01:33:54,333 --> 01:33:56,041
<i>My longing for my daughter</i>

793
01:33:56,125 --> 01:33:58,625
<i>is healed instantly</i>
<i>every time I see Nirmala.</i>

794
01:34:02,458 --> 01:34:04,375
That Japanese man is a liar.

795
01:34:05,208 --> 01:34:07,291
He's not divorced from his wife.

796
01:34:08,083 --> 01:34:10,791
His wife and daughter
died in a car accident.

797
01:34:10,875 --> 01:34:12,625
And he did that intentionally.

798
01:34:13,625 --> 01:34:16,583
When I picked up Uti Yah
and Nirmala that night,

799
01:34:18,125 --> 01:34:20,000
Nirmala seemed to be in pain.

800
01:34:24,625 --> 01:34:25,625
<i>She fell.</i>

801
01:34:33,333 --> 01:34:35,000
<i>She was running around and fell.</i>

802
01:34:35,083 --> 01:34:36,166
She fell?

803
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:40,458
Let me help you.

804
01:34:41,875 --> 01:34:42,916
<i>It's fine.</i>

805
01:34:44,833 --> 01:34:46,000
<i>Just drink the tea.</i>

806
01:34:49,333 --> 01:34:50,625
I translated this for you.

807
01:34:50,916 --> 01:34:53,041
See for yourself, ma'am.

808
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:23,625
Why did she fall, Mr. Tetsuya?

809
01:35:27,458 --> 01:35:30,500
<i>Some Japanese prefer the infusion of--</i>

810
01:35:32,208 --> 01:35:34,625
<i>It's more balanced in taste.</i>

811
01:35:37,791 --> 01:35:39,375
<i>The first one was strong.</i>

812
01:35:41,875 --> 01:35:43,166
Mr. Tetsuya.

813
01:35:44,708 --> 01:35:47,250
What really caused Nirmala to fall?

814
01:35:57,458 --> 01:35:58,416
<i>She was naughty.</i>

815
01:36:00,250 --> 01:36:01,416
<i>Miyako.</i>

816
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:02,333
<i>Naughty.</i>

817
01:36:06,583 --> 01:36:07,458
<i>I...</i>

818
01:36:09,458 --> 01:36:10,333
<i>dislike...</i>

819
01:36:11,458 --> 01:36:12,791
<i>naughty kids.</i>

820
01:36:12,875 --> 01:36:13,708
<i>Kids...</i>

821
01:36:13,791 --> 01:36:14,625
<i>respect...</i>

822
01:36:15,291 --> 01:36:16,625
<i>their parents.</i>

823
01:36:16,708 --> 01:36:18,125
<i>Especially their father.</i>

824
01:36:32,333 --> 01:36:33,583
They found this.

825
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:40,208
What actually happened?

826
01:36:40,833 --> 01:36:42,625
Do you know where Nirmala is?

827
01:36:46,083 --> 01:36:46,916
Miyako.

828
01:36:49,958 --> 01:36:53,166
Mr. Tetsuya! I'm Nirmala!

829
01:36:53,250 --> 01:36:57,333
Sir! It's me, Nirmala! I'm Nirmala, sir!

830
01:36:59,291 --> 01:37:00,833
Where are you going?

831
01:37:00,916 --> 01:37:02,083
Miyako!

832
01:37:06,541 --> 01:37:08,458
Miyako! Are you okay?

833
01:37:09,541 --> 01:37:10,458
Are you okay?

834
01:37:10,708 --> 01:37:12,083
It hurts!

835
01:37:12,166 --> 01:37:14,166
Where? Please tell Dad.

836
01:37:14,250 --> 01:37:15,708
Please tell Dad.

837
01:37:15,791 --> 01:37:18,125
Sir! Stop it, sir!

838
01:37:18,208 --> 01:37:20,291
Sir! Stop it, sir!

839
01:37:22,958 --> 01:37:25,041
Where does it hurt?

840
01:37:25,125 --> 01:37:27,000
Sir! Stop it, sir!

841
01:37:27,083 --> 01:37:28,333
Stop it! Are you crazy?

842
01:37:28,416 --> 01:37:30,750
I can report you to the police!

843
01:37:30,833 --> 01:37:32,625
I'll report you to the police!

844
01:37:32,958 --> 01:37:36,250
It hurts. It hurts.

845
01:38:35,041 --> 01:38:35,875
Nirmala.

846
01:39:09,958 --> 01:39:16,291
Throw it away. Don't put it here.
If I stay here...

847
01:39:18,583 --> 01:39:20,166
It's Mala, Mom!

848
01:39:20,250 --> 01:39:23,083
Help me, Mom! This is Mala!

849
01:39:45,291 --> 01:39:47,791
And the naughty kid must to be punished.

850
01:39:57,208 --> 01:40:00,250
I will introduce my daughter to you soon.

851
01:40:03,458 --> 01:40:04,625
She's back.

852
01:40:15,875 --> 01:40:17,958
This is the wish granted by 1,000 cranes.

853
01:40:24,416 --> 01:40:25,416
Bastard!

854
01:40:26,833 --> 01:40:27,666
Ma'am!

855
01:40:28,125 --> 01:40:29,125
Ma'am.

856
01:40:29,708 --> 01:40:30,625
Ma'am.

857
01:40:32,625 --> 01:40:33,583
Nirmala...

858
01:40:35,458 --> 01:40:36,458
Nirmala...

859
01:40:38,291 --> 01:40:41,208
{\an8}- We have to get out of here.
- Nirmala...

860
01:40:42,291 --> 01:40:44,666
{\an8}- What do you mean?
- She's here.

861
01:40:44,750 --> 01:40:46,291
{\an8}- What do you mean?
- She's here.

862
01:40:49,958 --> 01:40:50,833
Mala is here.

863
01:40:58,333 --> 01:40:59,166
You bastard!

864
01:41:48,708 --> 01:41:49,875
You're awake?

865
01:41:50,916 --> 01:41:54,208
My daughter will teach you
how to make an origami crane.

866
01:42:06,958 --> 01:42:08,666
Do it like how I taught you.

867
01:42:17,041 --> 01:42:18,125
Nirmala?

868
01:42:19,291 --> 01:42:20,166
Mom?

869
01:42:30,583 --> 01:42:31,708
Wait here.

870
01:42:40,458 --> 01:42:41,500
What do you want?

871
01:42:45,125 --> 01:42:46,458
You should understand.

872
01:42:49,958 --> 01:42:51,708
I just want my daughter back.

873
01:43:35,666 --> 01:43:37,041
I appreciate that.

874
01:43:47,833 --> 01:43:51,625
NAME: WENING SUQATI
PLACE, DATE OF BIRTH: INDRAMAYU 20-03-1984

875
01:43:51,708 --> 01:43:53,541
HAND OVER MY DAUGHTER TO TETSUYA...

876
01:44:05,833 --> 01:44:06,958
Coach.

877
01:44:10,958 --> 01:44:12,000
With this letter,

878
01:44:13,791 --> 01:44:15,541
she's officially my daughter.

879
01:44:17,625 --> 01:44:19,375
So don't be too harsh on her.

880
01:44:23,708 --> 01:44:26,750
Hey. Why don't you show us
how you make origami?

881
01:44:32,416 --> 01:44:34,500
Don't make me repeat myself.

882
01:44:42,375 --> 01:44:43,375
Come here.

883
01:44:48,333 --> 01:44:54,375
Fold the paper in half,

884
01:44:54,458 --> 01:44:57,208
then unfold it.

885
01:44:57,625 --> 01:45:04,000
Fold it on the other side, then unfold.

886
01:45:05,541 --> 01:45:07,541
Are you sure, Ning?

887
01:45:58,333 --> 01:45:59,291
Let her go!

888
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:07,250
Come!

889
01:46:13,166 --> 01:46:15,375
Come!

890
01:46:15,458 --> 01:46:16,291
Mom!

891
01:46:46,583 --> 01:46:47,833
Mom!

892
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:52,833
Let her go. She's my daughter.

893
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:54,791
I know that!

894
01:46:55,041 --> 01:46:55,916
No.

895
01:46:56,291 --> 01:46:58,375
She's happier with me.

896
01:47:07,958 --> 01:47:09,625
You're a killer!

897
01:47:19,916 --> 01:47:20,916
Mom!

898
01:47:30,625 --> 01:47:33,041
<i>Misfortune easily befalls</i>

899
01:47:34,291 --> 01:47:37,166
<i>those who strive hard</i>

900
01:47:38,833 --> 01:47:40,125
<i>for a better life.</i>

901
01:47:43,458 --> 01:47:45,375
<i>They call it the trials of life.</i>

902
01:47:48,708 --> 01:47:50,208
<i>And death...</i>

903
01:47:51,500 --> 01:47:54,333
<i>is a recurring experience for me.</i>

904
01:47:56,083 --> 01:47:58,375

Get off!

02:15.083 --> 02:16.666
- Move it!
- Line up!

02:19.583 --> 02:20.541
Hurry!

02:30.041 --> 02:31.791
Here's the file.

- Okay, Sir.
- Yes.

Move!

RATU ADIL PRISON

03:04.416 --> 03:06.333
Welcome to your new home.

03:06.916 --> 03:09.875
The new prisoners are here.

03:09.958 --> 03:11.750
What are you looking at?!

03:12.500 --> 03:14.875
Come here.

03:14.958 --> 03:15.791
<i>All of you…</i>

03:16.708 --> 03:18.791
<i>You are outcasts.</i>

03:19.375 --> 03:21.875
<i>Social outcasts!</i>

03:21.958 --> 03:23.708
<i>From now on,</i>

03:24.500 --> 03:28.083
<i>you'll be living here.</i>

03:28.708 --> 03:33.833
We have rules that you must obey.

03:34.833 --> 03:36.291
If you obey them,

03:37.041 --> 03:39.708
you'll be fine.

03:41.166 --> 03:44.791
I hope you'll be fine.

03:45.500 --> 03:46.666
Got it?

03:47.916 --> 03:51.458
- Warden, hand them the inmate supplies.
- Yes, Sir.

03:58.333 --> 04:01.041
Farhan, put them in their cells.

04:01.125 --> 04:02.333
On it, Sir!

04:03.250 --> 04:04.416
Take them!

04:19.000 --> 04:20.500
Make yourself at home.

04:45.541 --> 04:47.041
That's how Ms. Imah is.

04:47.125 --> 04:48.916
She's a bit insane.

04:49.583 --> 04:51.291
You'll get used to it.

04:52.875 --> 04:54.000
I'm Yanti.

04:56.291 --> 04:57.250
Wenny.

04:58.375 --> 04:59.500
Go ahead.

05:01.625 --> 05:04.541
Mr. Herman calls this place home.

05:05.333 --> 05:06.666
It is indeed a home…

05:07.625 --> 05:10.833
But it's a home where the hopes
of people who live here are dashed.

05:13.541 --> 05:15.250
You should be grateful,

05:16.125 --> 05:18.333
it's only the two of us in this cell.

05:19.291 --> 05:23.208
In other cells,
there are at least four people,

05:23.291 --> 05:25.083
or even ten or more people in one cell.

05:28.375 --> 05:29.708
Here.

05:29.791 --> 05:33.000
It's the only thing
that can keep us sane living here.

05:36.166 --> 05:37.666
Feel free to read these books.

05:37.750 --> 05:40.333
You can pick
which side you want to sleep on.

05:58.625 --> 05:59.750
Move!

06:02.916 --> 06:05.083
- Move aside!
- Move, you bastards!

06:17.041 --> 06:18.250
Who's she?

06:18.958 --> 06:20.333
Just hold your tongue.

06:21.250 --> 06:23.375
Hey, why are you here?

06:23.458 --> 06:25.958
Move, you bastards!

06:26.041 --> 06:27.291
Move!

06:50.541 --> 06:51.750
Are you new here?

06:54.041 --> 06:55.208
What?

06:55.708 --> 06:56.958
Can't you see what I'm doing?

06:59.500 --> 07:00.791
Sorry.

07:12.958 --> 07:14.125
Stop it!

07:15.375 --> 07:16.500
She might die!

07:17.291 --> 07:18.708
Hey!

07:19.541 --> 07:21.291
Hey! Stop it!

07:23.125 --> 07:24.416
What's going on here?

07:31.000 --> 07:32.666
Prisoner 218!

07:33.250 --> 07:34.583
You take her to the clinic!

07:36.250 --> 07:37.958
And you, Adit,

07:38.041 --> 07:39.166
keep an eye on them!

07:44.250 --> 07:48.041
Can you get up? Come on, one, two, three.

07:52.166 --> 07:53.333
Come on.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.791
Wen, have you lost your mind?

08:12.875 --> 08:14.750
Don't mess with Bella.

08:14.833 --> 08:17.125
She took the most feared prisoner's life.

08:17.208 --> 08:19.000
She almost took Suri's life.

08:19.083 --> 08:20.875
All those wardens stood still.

08:20.958 --> 08:22.625
But it's a prison.

08:23.208 --> 08:24.791
What do you expect?

08:25.958 --> 08:27.000
Wenny.

08:29.750 --> 08:31.625
The strong finish off the weak here.

08:32.291 --> 08:34.166
Don't mess with them.

08:34.750 --> 08:36.125
Don't act tough.

08:36.208 --> 08:38.000
Are you saying that I should've sat back

08:38.083 --> 08:40.125
and watched her picking on someone?

08:41.375 --> 08:43.500
Unless you want to die in vain.

08:44.583 --> 08:46.208
Many have died in vain here.

08:46.291 --> 08:47.708
What are you talking about?

08:49.833 --> 08:51.500
Who died in vain?

08:55.041 --> 08:56.250
You'll find out.

09:27.125 --> 09:30.083
<i>Help!</i>

09:31.833 --> 09:35.125
- <i>Help!</i>
- Yanti!

09:41.291 --> 09:42.166
Who is that?

09:42.666 --> 09:45.500
- <i>Help!</i>
- Let it be. Just go to sleep.

09:48.041 --> 09:52.583
- It will fade away.
- <i>Help!</i>

09:54.875 --> 09:56.333
Wenny.

09:56.416 --> 09:57.833
Go to sleep.

09:59.916 --> 10:02.125
You'll find out about it later.

10:51.083 --> 10:52.208
Shit!

10:59.000 --> 10:59.958
Yanti.

11:00.458 --> 11:01.500
Hey!

11:02.916 --> 11:04.041
Yanti!

12:40.125 --> 12:41.500
Did you have a nightmare?

12:43.416 --> 12:45.416
What is it? Tell me.

12:54.625 --> 12:55.625
Yes, Ma'am.

12:56.750 --> 12:58.250
I'll wait for you outside.

13:01.833 --> 13:03.625
It's your first day here.

13:04.291 --> 13:07.875
I'll let you know
the people you should watch out for.

13:11.541 --> 13:12.625
Look.

13:13.666 --> 13:15.375
See that warden?

13:16.166 --> 13:17.250
Hands up!

13:17.333 --> 13:18.916
He's Farhan.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
He's like a dog
that is loyal to his master,

13:22.083 --> 13:22.916
Mr. Herman.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.083
Both of them are the same.

13:26.166 --> 13:28.625
They are cruel.

13:28.708 --> 13:31.208
So, you shouldn't deal with them.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.041
There.

13:37.833 --> 13:39.500
See those two wardens?

13:41.250 --> 13:42.958
They are scumbag wardens.

13:44.916 --> 13:46.458
And they're also gold diggers.

13:47.083 --> 13:50.500
If you bribe them,
you'll be living here just fine.

13:57.041 --> 13:58.333
See the other one over there.

13:59.166 --> 14:00.500
The new warden.

14:02.333 --> 14:03.500
He's Adit.

14:04.750 --> 14:06.166
He's new here.

14:07.125 --> 14:09.375
He hasn't messed around yet.

14:09.458 --> 14:11.166
But who knows,

14:11.250 --> 14:13.458
in one or two years,

14:13.541 --> 14:15.791
he'll be like the other wardens.

14:16.375 --> 14:17.833
They're hypocrites.

14:25.625 --> 14:27.083
Prisoner 218.

14:27.166 --> 14:28.875
Come with me to see the doctor.

14:29.875 --> 14:31.666
Yeah…

14:31.750 --> 14:33.166
The doctor…

14:33.250 --> 14:35.166
I bet you'll like her.

14:51.708 --> 14:53.708
How are you feeling?

14:55.500 --> 14:57.666
How was your first day here?

15:02.125 --> 15:03.875
What should I say?

15:06.833 --> 15:08.708
What you feel.

15:15.583 --> 15:17.291
And please fill this out.

15:21.916 --> 15:24.000
Is it a psychological test?

15:26.375 --> 15:29.666
I just want to get to know you.

15:37.416 --> 15:38.791
BIODATA: DRUG SUSPECT
WENNY SEPTYANI

15:38.875 --> 15:40.958
Wenny Bagaskara?

15:45.000 --> 15:46.625
Please have the tea.

15:47.500 --> 15:48.791
Sorry,

15:48.875 --> 15:51.958
I can only serve a cup of tea.

16:01.208 --> 16:05.166
Unlike others,
this prison is a different kettle of fish.

16:07.958 --> 16:11.500
Well, that's the concept.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.583
You can tell me about anything,

16:15.458 --> 16:17.958
so that you can feel comfortable.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.208
I heard strange sounds last night.

16:27.208 --> 16:28.708
The same thing again.

16:30.875 --> 16:32.833
The one from the isolation ward, right?

16:39.875 --> 16:45.375
I actually don't believe
the rumors about the isolation ward.

16:45.458 --> 16:47.708
About a ghost or something
in the isolation ward.

16:48.250 --> 16:50.333
It doesn't make sense to me.

16:51.958 --> 16:55.875
That place looks scary at night,

16:55.958 --> 16:58.375
so it makes people think nonsense.

16:59.500 --> 17:00.833
That's just my assumption.

17:01.958 --> 17:03.250
You get me?

17:03.833 --> 17:04.833
I get you.

17:11.625 --> 17:13.458
Is it done, Doctor?

17:14.791 --> 17:16.166
It is, Wenny.

17:16.750 --> 17:18.250
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

17:26.083 --> 17:29.708
TO BE THE WINNER OF LIFE

17:35.083 --> 17:36.916
- Wenny.
- Yanti.

17:39.875 --> 17:42.083
What do you think of the doctor?
She's nice, isn't she?

17:43.708 --> 17:44.791
Yes, she is.

17:48.208 --> 17:52.666
She is the only one
who's in her right mind here.

17:55.833 --> 17:58.625
She's like a mother
to all of the prisoners here.

18:00.166 --> 18:03.083
So, if you feel like
pouring your heart out,

18:03.166 --> 18:05.250
you can confide in her.

18:07.250 --> 18:10.500
At least,
she can keep us sane living here.

18:13.500 --> 18:15.541
What is the isolation ward?

18:21.625 --> 18:24.333
It's the room near our cell.

18:26.333 --> 18:28.583
Those sounds were coming
from there, right?

18:40.833 --> 18:42.083
Yes.

18:43.708 --> 18:45.208
It's a cursed room.

18:46.041 --> 18:48.250
People go in there,

18:48.958 --> 18:50.708
but few can get out of there.

18:52.958 --> 18:54.416
That's why

18:55.083 --> 18:57.208
all the prisoners here are scared.

19:01.458 --> 19:03.416
Someone was sacrificed last night.

19:05.041 --> 19:06.666
And someone died.

19:08.958 --> 19:10.125
Prisoner 218.

19:10.791 --> 19:11.958
Come with me.

19:26.541 --> 19:29.041
- Where are we going?
- To the kitchen.

19:29.125 --> 19:31.000
I need you to help in the kitchen.

19:33.416 --> 19:37.166
Ms. Sekar is the senior prisoner
who prepares your meals.

19:39.166 --> 19:41.041
According to the information,
she used to be close to Ratna.

19:48.291 --> 19:51.000
I've been assigned here by Syaiman
for quite a long time.

19:53.166 --> 19:56.416
<i>Ratna became the umpteenth victim</i>
<i>of Ratu Adil Prison</i>

19:56.500 --> 19:57.916
<i>under Herman's leadership</i>

19:58.000 --> 20:00.291
<i>which I investigated.</i>

20:02.250 --> 20:04.125
<i>There's something off there.</i>

20:05.375 --> 20:07.291
But I haven't found out what yet.

20:09.375 --> 20:12.791
That's all I can tell you.

20:14.375 --> 20:17.375
I'm sorry for your loss, Wenny.

20:19.250 --> 20:22.041
Put me in that prison.

20:22.125 --> 20:23.625
So that I'll be able to find out myself.

20:25.541 --> 20:27.833
That's not something to joke about.

20:29.208 --> 20:30.916
I need to find out about…

20:31.000 --> 20:32.958
my sister's death there.

20:37.166 --> 20:39.416
As a prosecutor…

20:40.083 --> 20:41.916
you should be able
to put me in jail, right, Sir?

20:46.500 --> 20:47.666
Unfortunately,

20:48.291 --> 20:50.958
male wardens have little authority here.

20:51.041 --> 20:54.875
I've been here for three months,
but I've got little information.

20:57.125 --> 21:00.375
I heard strange sounds last night.

21:10.333 --> 21:12.916
I've heard that too.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.958
Of those that go in there,

21:17.958 --> 21:20.083
only a few get back to their cells.

21:29.875 --> 21:31.375
You should be careful.

21:32.625 --> 21:33.958
I'll keep you safe.

21:40.708 --> 21:41.958
Let's clean this.

21:43.750 --> 21:44.875
Clean them up properly.

21:46.791 --> 21:48.333
- Take them to the kitchen.
- Alright.

21:54.166 --> 21:55.000
Ms. Sekar.

21:58.708 --> 21:59.833
This is Wenny.

21:59.916 --> 22:01.750
Henceforth, she will help you
in the kitchen.

22:03.125 --> 22:04.541
- Sekar.
- Wenny.

22:05.041 --> 22:06.875
Wenny, do you cook?

22:06.958 --> 22:08.041
I do.

22:08.125 --> 22:10.083
- Do you know how to cut potatoes?
- I do.

22:10.166 --> 22:11.750
You help me in the kitchen.

22:13.250 --> 22:14.500
Come.

22:14.583 --> 22:15.625
Sir.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.541
You help me with potatoes.

22:18.625 --> 22:21.750
There should be enough for everyone.

22:21.833 --> 22:23.166
Otherwise, we'll be scolded
by the wardens.

22:27.666 --> 22:28.750
Move!

22:36.125 --> 22:37.333
Add some more!

22:39.375 --> 22:41.375
Every prisoner gets the same portion.

22:46.333 --> 22:47.291
Here you go.

22:56.666 --> 22:57.958
Don't look for trouble.

22:58.041 --> 23:00.250
Everything we've prepared
might get wasted.

23:03.666 --> 23:05.250
Go and have breakfast.

23:10.250 --> 23:11.791
No vegetables, please.

23:12.375 --> 23:15.083
Don't you like vegetables at all?

23:15.166 --> 23:16.625
You know,

23:16.708 --> 23:19.666
vegetables are good for your health.

23:19.750 --> 23:24.500
You remind me of one of prisoners
who used to help me.

23:24.583 --> 23:27.791
She didn't like vegetables, just like you.

23:27.875 --> 23:29.041
Who was she?

23:29.625 --> 23:30.583
It was Ratna.

23:31.166 --> 23:33.875
She used to help me
in the kitchen every day.

23:34.458 --> 23:36.291
She said that

23:36.375 --> 23:39.833
she didn't like vegetables
since her sister also hated them, right?

23:40.875 --> 23:42.750
Hey, help me.

23:46.166 --> 23:47.791
So, you're Ratna's sister?

23:49.041 --> 23:53.125
Do you have any idea
why my sister ended up dead here?

23:55.791 --> 23:57.041
She fell into a trap.

23:57.708 --> 23:59.875
That's what she told me.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
I believed her.

24:03.083 --> 24:04.333
She was a good person.

24:04.958 --> 24:06.666
But unfortunately,

24:07.625 --> 24:09.708
bad luck brought her here.

24:14.708 --> 24:16.083
What did you see?

24:27.375 --> 24:30.833
I need more information about it, Ma'am.

24:31.833 --> 24:33.916
How did she end up dead here?

24:34.000 --> 24:37.583
I promise I'll tell you about it.

24:37.666 --> 24:39.041
But this isn't the right time.

24:39.625 --> 24:41.541
There are too many of them
that might hear us.

24:41.625 --> 24:43.458
Come and help me tomorrow morning.

24:46.375 --> 24:48.166
What are you doing here?

24:48.250 --> 24:49.708
Come on, get out!

24:49.791 --> 24:51.666
You still have a lot to do!

24:56.708 --> 24:57.958
Ma'am.

24:58.041 --> 24:59.250
Tomorrow, okay?

25:15.625 --> 25:16.875
Give it back!

25:16.958 --> 25:20.250
- What's this?
- The bodyguard's here.

25:21.083 --> 25:22.083
I'm scared.

25:25.125 --> 25:26.750
I'm telling you both…

25:26.833 --> 25:28.375
I'll finish you off one by one.

25:29.791 --> 25:31.000
It would be better if you were with me.

25:31.083 --> 25:32.416
Why would you be with her?

25:32.500 --> 25:34.333
She's such a dumb-ass and useless.

25:34.416 --> 25:36.250
What did you say? Dumb-ass?

25:37.166 --> 25:39.958
- Bella!
- How long will you take?

25:40.041 --> 25:42.458
- A lot of people want to take a shower!
- Don't intervene!

25:42.541 --> 25:44.291
Hey, stop it!

25:44.375 --> 25:45.916
Why are you making a fuss?

25:46.000 --> 25:47.625
Disperse!

25:49.166 --> 25:51.875
We'll see how long your guts last.

25:52.416 --> 25:53.625
You little brat!

25:58.250 --> 25:59.500
Thank you.

25:59.583 --> 26:00.875
I'm just going to take a shower.

26:01.750 --> 26:03.791
I'm Yeti. She's Jane.

26:04.875 --> 26:07.666
- Wenny.
- We owe you.

26:34.666 --> 26:35.583
Come here!

26:54.916 --> 26:55.958
Sorry.

26:59.208 --> 27:01.250
Where is Ms. Sekar, Ma'am?

27:01.333 --> 27:03.500
I haven't seen her this morning.

27:04.291 --> 27:05.625
- Thank you.
- Yes.

27:09.958 --> 27:12.166
Have you seen Ms. Sekar?

27:12.250 --> 27:13.208
- What?
- Ms. Sekar.

27:13.291 --> 27:14.375
I haven't.

27:20.541 --> 27:23.000
- Have you seen Ms. Sekar?
- I haven't.

27:23.083 --> 27:24.166
Sir.

27:25.250 --> 27:26.250
How is it going, Wen?

27:26.916 --> 27:29.208
Have you got any updates
about your sister's death?

27:29.291 --> 27:31.500
Ms. Sekar said
she would tell me about it this morning.

27:31.583 --> 27:34.375
But she isn't in the dining room.

27:34.458 --> 27:35.708
Where is she?

27:37.125 --> 27:38.541
I'll help you look for her.

27:39.375 --> 27:40.458
Yes, Sir.

27:54.375 --> 27:55.791
You don't need to worry.

27:56.666 --> 27:58.083
You can count on me.

27:58.666 --> 28:01.083
Jane and I should be in the same cell,
no matter what.

28:05.333 --> 28:06.416
Thank you.

28:07.583 --> 28:08.916
Keep your word.

28:09.458 --> 28:10.708
You've made a promise.

28:11.833 --> 28:13.333
Pass it to me!

28:13.416 --> 28:15.000
Get this!

28:18.833 --> 28:21.000
We haven't seen Bella today, right?

28:22.291 --> 28:24.041
She did nothing to you, did she?

28:24.958 --> 28:26.666
How would she have the guts to?

28:26.750 --> 28:28.083
We have her here.

28:29.833 --> 28:31.083
Wen.

28:31.166 --> 28:33.083
You should be careful though.

28:33.166 --> 28:36.333
She is cunning.
You never know what she's up to.

28:45.833 --> 28:47.833
Happy birthday!

28:47.916 --> 28:49.416
I hope you like it.

28:49.500 --> 28:51.791
Oh, come on.

28:53.375 --> 28:56.000
Why did you get me this
as my birthday present?

28:56.791 --> 29:00.375
- Is a journalist's salary that low?
- It's not like that.

29:00.458 --> 29:04.916
But I think
your hair often covers your face.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.625
So, I got you a hair clip.

29:07.708 --> 29:10.500
I told you I wanted a new bag.

29:11.375 --> 29:12.458
Wenny.

29:13.458 --> 29:14.291
You go ahead.

29:18.666 --> 29:19.625
Ms. Imah.

29:20.625 --> 29:22.583
Where did you get that?

29:22.666 --> 29:25.416
I'm just asking you
where you got this hair clip?

29:25.500 --> 29:26.958
I won't take it away.

29:33.875 --> 29:35.916
Ms. Imah has been keeping a secret…

29:39.416 --> 29:41.916
About how she could escape
the isolation ward.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.625
And no one knows

29:47.583 --> 29:49.666
how she could escape from there.

29:51.500 --> 29:54.750
Does anyone know
the reason she got thrown in jail?

30:05.166 --> 30:06.541
For mutilation.

30:22.125 --> 30:23.791
Any news?

30:25.208 --> 30:26.958
They need fresh supplies.

30:27.541 --> 30:29.250
- Any captives?
- Yes, there are.

30:30.458 --> 30:31.833
Here, Sir.

30:43.583 --> 30:45.291
They really think

30:45.375 --> 30:48.125
they could buy this place
with this amount of money, huh?

30:50.250 --> 30:52.000
When will the execution take place?

30:53.791 --> 30:54.875
Immediately, Sir.

30:55.500 --> 30:58.750
Okay. Do it seamlessly.

30:58.833 --> 31:01.541
And increase the dose.

31:02.041 --> 31:04.166
Will do, Sir.

31:05.083 --> 31:06.166
I'll excuse myself.

31:18.791 --> 31:19.916
Wenny.

31:23.791 --> 31:26.500
- Sir.
- Ms. Sekar hasn't been found yet.

31:27.916 --> 31:29.125
Be careful, okay?

31:30.583 --> 31:32.208
The situation is getting messed up.

31:34.375 --> 31:35.458
Okay.

32:11.541 --> 32:12.916
Ms. Imah…

32:16.041 --> 32:18.375
I just need to talk to you.

32:18.875 --> 32:22.666
No, Ma'am. I just need to talk to you.

32:22.750 --> 32:25.333
I'm Ratna's sister.

32:25.916 --> 32:29.000
I gave that hair clip to her.

32:30.208 --> 32:33.125
- This one?
- Yeah, that was from me.

32:33.208 --> 32:36.208
Can I just talk to you?

32:38.625 --> 32:39.875
It's about Ratna.

33:12.166 --> 33:13.750
I can feel that

33:13.833 --> 33:15.833
you must have loved her.

33:16.958 --> 33:18.000
Right?

33:21.958 --> 33:23.666
I just want to find out about…

33:24.666 --> 33:29.291
how she ended up dying here.

33:31.625 --> 33:36.208
I'll ask you about
what happened in the isolation ward.

33:37.833 --> 33:40.833
I don't know who else to ask.

33:43.291 --> 33:44.333
Anyway…

33:48.208 --> 33:49.458
This is for you.

33:50.583 --> 33:51.708
For me?

33:52.875 --> 33:57.625
- Thank you.
- You can use it as an amulet.

33:59.458 --> 34:00.666
Hey!

34:01.708 --> 34:02.791
Why?

34:03.500 --> 34:04.708
- It's okay, kid.
- No, Ma'am.

34:04.791 --> 34:06.583
Stop it.

34:06.666 --> 34:09.083
What are you trying to do?

34:14.916 --> 34:16.208
Stop it!

34:17.250 --> 34:19.875
What is wrong with you all?

34:21.541 --> 34:23.083
Are you done?

34:25.625 --> 34:28.583
Are you finished making trouble?

34:28.666 --> 34:29.708
All of you.

34:31.208 --> 34:33.416
Someone needs to be put
in the isolation ward.

34:33.500 --> 34:34.583
Yes, Sir.

34:34.666 --> 34:36.250
Take them.

34:37.375 --> 34:38.875
Get up!

34:38.958 --> 34:40.291
Come on, get up!

34:40.375 --> 34:41.666
Come on!

35:51.916 --> 35:53.208
Shut up!

35:56.833 --> 35:58.208
It hurts!

35:58.291 --> 35:59.500
Get inside!

35:59.583 --> 36:00.625
Get inside!

36:02.458 --> 36:05.500
You're a piece of shit!

36:05.583 --> 36:07.041
Get inside, all of you, now!

36:07.125 --> 36:08.625
Jane!

36:08.708 --> 36:10.000
Jane!

36:17.208 --> 36:22.000
You broke your promise, bastard!

36:25.916 --> 36:27.916
Get up, bitch!

36:29.375 --> 36:31.208
Do you think you gave me enough money…

36:31.291 --> 36:32.625
to buy a place?

36:32.708 --> 36:34.708
You no longer have places here,

36:34.791 --> 36:37.750
just so you know.

36:38.458 --> 36:40.250
Now,

36:40.333 --> 36:42.166
you've got a place in hell!

36:44.750 --> 36:45.833
Get in!

36:47.083 --> 36:48.250
Take that!

38:07.125 --> 38:09.458
I think I need to have a break.

38:10.208 --> 38:11.458
Maybe.

38:12.125 --> 38:13.708
You look tired.

38:16.875 --> 38:21.166
Some said you were the last person
Yeti and Jane were with.

38:21.250 --> 38:22.583
Maybe.

38:26.875 --> 38:29.083
Your heroic deed

38:29.166 --> 38:31.416
triggered them to dare do something more.

38:32.083 --> 38:34.000
What's wrong with that?

38:34.666 --> 38:36.000
Maybe something.

38:36.083 --> 38:37.375
Maybe not.

38:38.250 --> 38:42.416
Can't you see what has been going on
in this prison?

38:44.958 --> 38:47.750
Everyone bullies each other.

38:47.833 --> 38:48.916
Sexual assault

38:49.000 --> 38:50.666
and illegal transactions
are commonplace here.

38:50.750 --> 38:52.541
All the prisoners are living in fear.

38:52.625 --> 38:54.166
And everyone turns a blind eye to it.

38:55.541 --> 38:56.541
One more thing.

38:57.041 --> 39:00.666
Many people have
died unnatural deaths here.

39:00.750 --> 39:02.375
And you're untroubled by that fact?

39:16.416 --> 39:19.500
I just carry out my duties and orders

39:19.583 --> 39:21.666
in accordance with
the Hippocratic oath I've taken.

39:23.083 --> 39:25.083
What can I do?

39:26.333 --> 39:28.416
I wanted to do what you want to do.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.750
To turn this horrible place
into a good place to live.

39:31.833 --> 39:33.166
But you know what?

39:34.458 --> 39:37.166
It turns out that

39:37.250 --> 39:38.916
the world isn't as good as we think.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.625
Sorry, Ma'am.

39:40.708 --> 39:44.458
You think what you've done is enough.

39:44.541 --> 39:46.666
But for me, it's all just nonsense.

39:46.750 --> 39:48.500
Nothing you've done has made a difference.

39:50.583 --> 39:52.791
I'm done with my session.

39:52.875 --> 39:53.958
Wenny.

39:56.083 --> 39:57.666
You shouldn't look for trouble.

39:58.333 --> 40:01.333
Yeti and Jane…

40:01.416 --> 40:03.250
They're an example for you.

40:15.000 --> 40:18.541
Why do people end up dead
every time they mess up with Bella?

40:19.541 --> 40:21.083
There must be something wrong, right?

40:21.166 --> 40:23.333
Something between her
and the isolation ward.

40:28.166 --> 40:30.458
Do you have access to the isolation ward?

40:30.541 --> 40:32.708
I have a limited access here.

40:36.291 --> 40:40.250
That means
I have to find another way, right?

40:52.000 --> 40:53.583
I have a task for you.

40:53.666 --> 40:55.541
Our deal is over.

40:57.916 --> 41:00.375
I've done everything you asked for.

41:06.166 --> 41:09.416
Do you think you can get smart with me?

41:10.625 --> 41:11.833
Alright.

41:12.875 --> 41:15.083
I'm sorry, Sir.

41:15.166 --> 41:17.375
Do your job.

41:18.625 --> 41:21.875
And your child will be safe.

41:22.500 --> 41:25.916
I will do anything,
as long as my child is safe.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.541
Good.

41:27.625 --> 41:30.208
We have understood each other.

41:30.791 --> 41:32.166
I can guarantee

41:32.833 --> 41:35.541
your child's safety.

41:46.875 --> 41:48.375
Come on!

42:04.708 --> 42:06.458
Shit!

42:06.541 --> 42:07.875
Fuck!

42:21.458 --> 42:24.291
BIODATA: DRUG SUSPECT
WENNY SEPTYANI

42:29.166 --> 42:30.208
That's a crazy idea.

42:31.791 --> 42:33.666
Syaiman wouldn't approve it.

42:35.750 --> 42:37.625
I don't need his approval.

42:39.208 --> 42:40.958
Do you have any better ideas?

42:42.791 --> 42:44.416
You might die there.

42:45.541 --> 42:47.125
I'm not afraid of death.

42:50.291 --> 42:52.083
This is your sister's autopsy report.

42:52.750 --> 42:55.250
We're sure there was something else

42:55.333 --> 42:58.125
that made your sister
and the other victims die there.

42:58.208 --> 43:01.250
But these people are too powerful.

43:02.791 --> 43:05.041
I couldn't do anything.

43:06.500 --> 43:10.083
The victim's deaths
have one thing in common.

43:10.166 --> 43:13.583
All the autopsies
were performed in private.

43:15.041 --> 43:18.541
And they concluded that

43:18.625 --> 43:21.458
the cause of all those deaths was suicide.

43:23.750 --> 43:26.333
<i>Who knows who the next victim will be?</i>

43:27.750 --> 43:30.791
I don't want to die in vain
without doing anything.

43:37.875 --> 43:40.833
I need to get into the isolation ward.

43:55.041 --> 43:56.125
Wenny!

43:58.666 --> 44:00.166
What are you doing?

44:00.250 --> 44:02.416
What are you doing, Wen?

44:02.500 --> 44:03.541
Wenny!

45:00.000 --> 45:00.916
Get in there!

45:11.166 --> 45:13.416
You social outcast!

45:13.500 --> 45:15.291
I often tell you

45:15.375 --> 45:19.500
that I have my own rules.

45:19.583 --> 45:22.916
There are rules that you need to obey.

45:23.500 --> 45:25.250
And you broke them.

46:05.166 --> 46:06.416
Ratna?

48:03.333 --> 48:04.291
Yeah.

48:27.083 --> 48:28.083
Ratna.

49:24.708 --> 49:25.708
Wenny?

49:34.541 --> 49:35.625
This is the first time

49:35.708 --> 49:39.041
I've seen someone
that can handle that much LSD.

49:42.083 --> 49:44.166
You're really strong.

49:47.916 --> 49:49.333
What do you mean?

49:52.875 --> 49:55.791
Like two flies get stuck in the same hole.

50:00.333 --> 50:03.583
You and your sister, Ratna.

50:04.083 --> 50:06.916
Both of you are idiots!

50:09.875 --> 50:15.875
You will both be stuck
and die in the same place.

50:20.166 --> 50:22.291
You took Ratna's life?

50:25.791 --> 50:26.625
I did.

50:30.333 --> 50:32.000
Something like that.

50:36.541 --> 50:38.875
No one should know

50:40.083 --> 50:41.791
our secrets.

50:44.416 --> 50:46.416
<i>We need to mutilate her.</i>

51:02.750 --> 51:04.208
<i>Jane and Yeti…</i>

51:04.291 --> 51:05.500
<i>They had young blood.</i>

51:05.583 --> 51:07.125
<i>A lot of people order</i>

51:07.208 --> 51:09.208
<i>fresh organs,</i>

51:09.291 --> 51:11.125
<i>like healthy hearts,</i>

51:11.208 --> 51:12.541
<i>healthy kidneys,</i>

51:12.625 --> 51:14.833
<i>since they need them.</i>

51:14.916 --> 51:16.208
<i>We can't turn down those offers.</i>

51:16.291 --> 51:18.125
<i>And we had to sacrifice them.</i>

51:18.208 --> 51:19.375
<i>Sekar…</i>

51:19.458 --> 51:21.875
<i>A poor old lady.</i>

51:21.958 --> 51:25.125
<i>Had she kept her lips sealed,</i>

51:25.208 --> 51:27.041
<i>she would be still breathing.</i>

51:29.041 --> 51:32.250
But it wasn't personal.

51:32.750 --> 51:34.416
It's just business.

51:37.208 --> 51:40.583
Someone will pay a lot for a kidney.

51:42.083 --> 51:44.041
And thanks to your sister

51:44.625 --> 51:46.583
I've gone from rags to riches.

51:57.166 --> 51:58.541
You bitch!

52:03.750 --> 52:05.583
Chill, Wenny.

52:05.666 --> 52:09.375
You were both just unlucky
to end up here and meet us.

52:19.916 --> 52:22.166
Please don't hold a grudge against me.

52:24.541 --> 52:26.000
I'm sorry.

52:27.333 --> 52:29.166
I assure you

52:29.250 --> 52:31.000
this won't hurt.

52:33.958 --> 52:35.791
Send my regards

52:36.791 --> 52:39.375
to your beloved sister, Ratna.

53:04.791 --> 53:06.541
For Ratna.

54:32.916 --> 54:36.666
We need to send these organs tonight
while they're still fresh.

55:12.125 --> 55:13.208
Help!

55:30.375 --> 55:34.041
This is for our last job.

55:34.125 --> 55:35.791
And for our success.

55:35.875 --> 55:37.083
Bottoms up!

55:44.333 --> 55:45.791
- We're reporting, Sir!
- What happened?

55:45.875 --> 55:47.208
It's Wenny.

55:47.291 --> 55:49.083
- Why?
- She escaped.

55:49.166 --> 55:51.458
She also killed Yanti.

55:52.000 --> 55:55.291
Farhan, you need to find and catch her.

55:56.083 --> 55:57.708
- Wardens!
- Yes, Sir.

55:57.791 --> 56:01.375
Wenny escaped the isolation ward.
I need all of you to find her!

56:01.458 --> 56:04.750
- No one can go home! Got it?
- Yes, Sir.

56:04.833 --> 56:07.000
Hurry up, now!

56:08.916 --> 56:09.958
Damn it!

56:30.250 --> 56:31.583
Get back in!

56:31.666 --> 56:32.791
Get back!

56:35.916 --> 56:36.750
Hey!

56:50.125 --> 56:52.875
Where are you going, babe?

56:54.125 --> 56:55.750
What the heck!

56:57.708 --> 56:58.625
Come!

57:00.333 --> 57:01.958
You bitch!

57:08.750 --> 57:09.916
Fuck!

57:13.416 --> 57:16.166
How dare you hit me, you bitch!

57:44.541 --> 57:46.750
Where are you going, sweetheart?

57:46.833 --> 57:49.250
Stop running away.

57:49.833 --> 57:52.250
You'll get tired.

57:55.333 --> 57:56.416
Bastard!

58:03.333 --> 58:04.666
Fuck you!

58:09.583 --> 58:10.875
I told you…

58:20.458 --> 58:21.791
Fuck!

58:29.208 --> 58:30.291
Wenny.

58:30.375 --> 58:31.916
It's me, Adit.

58:32.000 --> 58:33.083
Wenny.

58:42.791 --> 58:44.916
Are you okay?

58:55.250 --> 58:56.250
Ms. Imah.

58:57.375 --> 58:58.208
Ma'am.

58:59.375 --> 59:01.791
Listen to me, Wen.

59:01.875 --> 59:02.916
Wenny.

59:03.541 --> 59:05.541
We need to report to Syaiman.

59:05.625 --> 59:08.583
- He's the only one who can help us.
- How?

59:09.458 --> 59:12.875
There are only two telephones
in this prison.

59:14.083 --> 59:16.333
One is in Herman's office.

59:16.416 --> 59:18.750
And the other one
is in Ms. Rusdiyah's office.

59:21.791 --> 59:23.208
Herman is the mastermind.

59:24.083 --> 59:27.500
They sold the organs
of all the dead prisoners,

59:27.583 --> 59:29.458
including Ratna's.

59:31.541 --> 59:34.416
They faked all the deaths.

59:39.291 --> 59:40.750
Fuck!

59:46.458 --> 59:47.791
We have to go to Ms. Rusdiyah's office.

59:47.875 --> 59:49.541
It's the closest to here.

59:59.791 --> 01:00:02.041
We're almost there. Come on, Wen.

01:00:07.666 --> 01:00:08.500
Run, Wenny!

01:00:20.333 --> 01:00:22.333
You traitor!

01:00:22.833 --> 01:00:23.875
Hey!

01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:29.416
Get out, hurry up!

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:31.125
Let's go!

01:00:32.791 --> 01:00:33.958
Get up!

01:00:47.916 --> 01:00:49.166
- Come on.
- Let's go.

01:00:53.916 --> 01:00:54.916
Hey!

01:00:59.958 --> 01:01:01.375
Stop.

01:01:02.125 --> 01:01:03.375
Get him!

01:01:09.208 --> 01:01:10.375
Wenny.

01:01:10.458 --> 01:01:11.708
What happened?

01:01:11.791 --> 01:01:13.250
Why did you lock it?

01:01:13.833 --> 01:01:15.375
What happened to you?

01:01:15.458 --> 01:01:18.833
Ma'am, you need to know everything.

01:01:20.250 --> 01:01:21.333
What's wrong?

01:01:22.208 --> 01:01:26.250
Yanti injected the prisoners
in the isolation ward.

01:01:26.333 --> 01:01:27.875
Herman is the mastermind.

01:01:28.833 --> 01:01:33.083
We need to report them.
They've been selling…

01:01:33.166 --> 01:01:35.583
They've been selling
the organs of the prisoners.

01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:37.875
Calm down.

01:01:37.958 --> 01:01:39.708
Tell me slowly.

01:01:39.791 --> 01:01:43.916
Aren't you supposed to be
in the isolation ward?

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.458
You don't understand.
They tried to kill me!

01:01:47.541 --> 01:01:49.041
We need to make a call.

01:01:49.125 --> 01:01:50.500
We have to.

01:01:50.583 --> 01:01:51.583
It's right there.

01:01:52.916 --> 01:01:54.916
- I need to call…
- Alright.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.083
I'll get you some water.

01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:08.916
Wenny.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.375
Have some water.

01:02:10.958 --> 01:02:13.083
Slowly.

01:02:15.958 --> 01:02:17.083
Sir.

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:21.583
- Ma'am.
- Wen?

01:02:21.666 --> 01:02:22.750
Wenny!

01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:25.583
Wen?

01:02:25.666 --> 01:02:26.875
Wenny!

01:02:27.375 --> 01:02:29.333
Wenny! Wen?

01:03:08.208 --> 01:03:09.208
Ma'am.

01:03:11.166 --> 01:03:12.375
Ma'am…

01:03:13.375 --> 01:03:15.083
Run for your life.

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:17.958
He's the bad guy.

01:03:19.041 --> 01:03:21.625
He's so evil. Run, hurry.

01:03:22.833 --> 01:03:25.583
You're awake?

01:03:29.458 --> 01:03:30.583
You need to relax.

01:03:37.250 --> 01:03:38.583
Relax.

01:03:42.166 --> 01:03:44.708
Everything has turned into a mess
because of you!

01:03:47.125 --> 01:03:49.916
No, I'm also responsible for this.

01:03:51.583 --> 01:03:55.250
It's because of my idiot husband

01:03:55.333 --> 01:03:58.583
and his idiot subordinates!

01:04:03.083 --> 01:04:05.041
And it's because of you,

01:04:05.125 --> 01:04:08.291
I have to take matters into my own hands.

01:04:10.250 --> 01:04:12.041
I'm sorry, Wenny.

01:04:13.333 --> 01:04:16.625
I'm not as good as you thought.

01:04:19.250 --> 01:04:21.375
I disappointed you, right?

01:04:23.041 --> 01:04:25.291
You're behind all of this?

01:04:26.208 --> 01:04:28.166
You're smart.

01:04:28.250 --> 01:04:33.166
All for money?

01:04:34.458 --> 01:04:36.500
Why not?

01:04:36.583 --> 01:04:41.333
This is the ideal place to do such things.

01:04:58.833 --> 01:05:02.000
They're sisters.

01:05:02.083 --> 01:05:04.666
And I'm sure Wenny's here

01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:07.125
to find out about her Ratna's death.

01:05:07.708 --> 01:05:09.708
You know who the next victim should be.

01:05:15.958 --> 01:05:17.000
Relax.

01:05:18.625 --> 01:05:20.875
You will be…

01:05:20.958 --> 01:05:24.250
the best closure.

01:05:28.166 --> 01:05:29.250
Chill.

01:05:29.333 --> 01:05:31.291
This won't hurt.

01:05:31.958 --> 01:05:32.916
Just a little bit.

01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:36.750
Relax.

01:05:39.791 --> 01:05:41.500
What's with the lights?

01:05:42.958 --> 01:05:44.041
Have a look.

01:06:14.875 --> 01:06:16.166
Are you okay?

01:06:44.666 --> 01:06:46.500
No!

01:06:52.750 --> 01:06:53.958
No!

01:06:56.083 --> 01:06:57.166
No…

01:06:59.791 --> 01:07:01.125
No!

01:07:01.208 --> 01:07:02.666
No!

01:07:44.333 --> 01:07:45.666
Don't move!

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.125
A FEW MONTHS LATER

01:08:06.041 --> 01:08:07.666
You can rest in peace now.

01:08:23.875 --> 01:08:27.750
I heard that the isolation ward
has truly been sealed now.

01:08:29.208 --> 01:08:30.250
That's good.

01:08:30.875 --> 01:08:32.458
There won't be any more victims.

01:08:33.541 --> 01:08:35.958
- What about Ms. Rusdiyah?
- At the mental asylum.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.583
She still needs to be held responsible

01:08:39.666 --> 01:08:41.875
for what she has done.

01:08:54.625 --> 01:08:56.000
What are you doing here?

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:07.916
Sweetheart.

01:09:08.416 --> 01:09:09.625
Mom!

01:09:31.208 --> 01:09:32.416
Thank you.

01:09:46.291 --> 01:09:47.458
Yes.

01:09:49.125 --> 01:09:51.375
<i>What are you planning to do after this?</i>

01:09:53.041 --> 01:09:55.041
To return to work.

01:09:56.583 --> 01:09:57.958
And…

01:09:58.041 --> 01:10:01.166
I'll write a book
about the story of that prison.

01:10:02.166 --> 01:10:03.958
So that everyone can learn about it.

01:10:07.375 --> 01:10:09.916
You'll be the first person I tell

01:10:10.541 --> 01:10:14.125
once the book is finished.

01:10:51.166 --> 01:10:53.000
<i>It's all over now.</i>

01:10:53.083 --> 01:10:56.583
Herman and Rusdiyah have been
gotten rid of.

01:10:57.708 --> 01:11:01.041
We've got this prison back.

01:11:03.541 --> 01:11:05.875
We can re-open the isolation ward.

01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:15.250
RATU ADIL PRISON

01:15:05.875 --> 01:15:06.791
Yes.

01:15:07.458 --> 01:15:09.041
Oh, you're a student?

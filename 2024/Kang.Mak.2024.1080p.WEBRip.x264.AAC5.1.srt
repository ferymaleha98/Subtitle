3
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:38,541
Evening, miss!

4
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,708
Evening, sir!

5
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:45,291
Kang Mak.

6
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:52,041
Kang Mak!

7
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:58,375
Fall in!

8
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:08,916
Watch out, it's a grenade!

9
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,083
PLUMERIA OPERATION

10
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,250
<i>Oh, my unfortunate destiny</i>

11
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:30,666
<i>When I was born</i>
<i>I was colonized by the Dutch</i>

12
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:35,125
<i>When I was little</i>
<i>I was colonized by Japanese</i>

13
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,708
<i>When I grew up</i>

14
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:40,791
<i>I was sent to war</i>

15
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:43,541
What song is that?

16
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:46,291
<i>Oh, my unfortunate destiny</i>

17
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:50,666
<i>Now, I'm just waiting</i>

18
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,500
<i>For my death</i>

19
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,458
Why did your voice get louder?

20
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,708
- Oh, my destiny…
- Shut up!

21
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,333
Solah.

22
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:03,708
He sang louder so that you'll hear him.

23
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,750
I know my hearing is impaired,

24
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,416
but I'm not deaf!

25
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:13,083
- You're deaf, Solah!
- No, I can still hear!

26
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,666
- What did you say?
- See?

27
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,875
You're deaf, Solah!

28
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,125
You didn't say anything!

29
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,416
Fine, how about you try singing?

30
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,958
- Fine, I will.
- Good!

31
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:31,708
- To boost our morale.
- Correct!

32
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,083
Come on, guys!

33
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:36,208
<i>If you're happy and you know it</i>
<i>Clap your hands!</i>

34
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,791
<i>If you're happy and you know it</i>
<i>Clap your hands!</i>

35
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,375
Let's sing another song.

36
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:49,791
Quiet!

37
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,666
Do you think we're on a picnic?

38
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,791
Are you happy being sent to war
from morning until night?

39
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,958
What should we do to boost our morale?

40
00:03:57,041 --> 00:04:00,750
I think now is not the time to sing.

41
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:14,208
It's time for us to rise and fight!

42
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:20,875
Let's show them that
they can't trample over us!

43
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:24,458
Whatever wounds we experience now

44
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:28,750
won't stop us from fighting

45
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,416
to make our country proud!

46
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,083
Fight!

47
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:35,750
Get out there! Raise your weapons!

48
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:37,375
Are you not coming?

49
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:42,375
You're all still young.

50
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:45,958
You should be at the front.
An old man like me will support you

51
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,375
from the back.

52
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:48,791
With prayers.

53
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,041
Come on, Supra!

54
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,541
On the battlefield, age doesn't matter!

55
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,833
If we want to advance,
we'll do it together!

56
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,000
Why are you copying me?

57
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,041
- Stop it!
- Stop it!

58
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,291
Enough!

59
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:06,958
If none of you wants to go,
I'll go by myself!

60
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,250
It's okay! I know I'm a scaredy-cat,

61
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,500
but this war has been going on
for too long.

62
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:14,583
I have to go home to my wife, Sari.

63
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
She must have already given birth.

64
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,625
Don't you miss your family?

65
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,291
You do, don't you?

66
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,208
That's why we have to
move forward without fear!

67
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,125
Stand up for what's right!

68
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,875
Move forward without fear!

69
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:37,500
Our rights are invaded!

70
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:40,333
Move together,

71
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,666
banish the attackers!

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,208
Move together,

73
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,375
we will surely win!

74
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,125
Cool!

75
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,041
You're so cool.

76
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,875
No! What do you mean cool?

77
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,000
Those were song lyrics.

78
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,250
What lyrics?

79
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,583
Take it from the top.

80
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,083
If none of you wants to go,

81
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:09,041
I'll go by myself, I don't mind!

82
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:11,958
From the "move forward."

83
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,875
Not that part,
start from the "move forward."

84
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:15,833
No.

85
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:19,750
Repeat the "move forward" part!

86
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,458
I don't appreciate you forcing me.

87
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,791
Everyone, stop!

88
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,208
It's not the time for us to play around!

89
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,583
It's time to show

90
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,625
who we are!

91
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:41,541
True soldiers!

92
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,666
Yessir!

93
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,916
<i>Good morning, noon, and night</i>

94
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,166
<i>We are true soldiers!</i>

95
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,166
<i>Soldiers of this land</i>

96
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,708
<i>Fighting for our country!</i>

97
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,375
<i>This is our spirit!</i>

98
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:05,208
<i>Forever brothers, in life and death!</i>

99
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,791
Indonesia!

100
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,750
Indonesia!

101
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,416
Kang Mak!

102
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,041
Kang Mak!

103
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,291
Get inside!

104
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:43,041
- Son! Let's get inside!
- Why, Dad?

105
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,375
Don't ask! Just get in!

106
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,708
- Come on!
- Kang Mak!

107
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,166
Close the doors and windows!

108
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,875
Our child is born, honey.

109
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,333
At this rate, we'll die soon!

110
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,000
Dear God,

111
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,333
please don't take my life.

112
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,958
I have to live.

113
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:23,208
Whatever happens,
I need to see my wife and child.

114
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:24,833
Please, God!

115
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,083
Hey!

116
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,250
Don't talk about death.

117
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,583
That's taboo.

118
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:38,416
- We're still alive!
- If Makmur doesn't want to die,

119
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,333
then, we can't die.

120
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,833
If that's the case, none of us can die.

121
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,125
We have to stay alive!

122
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,541
True soldiers!

123
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,583
Attack!

124
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,208
Attack!

125
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,541
Attack!

126
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,125
Attack!

127
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,333
Retreat!

128
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,875
Retreat!

129
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,041
Sari…

130
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:23,125
Sari!

131
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:32,416
<i>Go to sleep, my dear child</i>

132
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:39,208
<i>Mom is here, waiting</i>

133
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,708
<i>For your father, Makmur</i>

134
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,333
Mom, I'm scared.

135
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:53,500
<i>Together again</i>

136
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,166
<i>Your father, Makmur</i>

137
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,416
<i>He will come</i>

138
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,583
Solah.

139
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:12,791
We're alive.

140
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,791
I'm coming home, honey!

141
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,791
We're alive!

142
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,333
We're alive!

143
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:38,500
Since my village is the closest,
let's go to Fajrul's village first.

144
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,125
After that, we'll go to Solah's village.

145
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,125
Then, to Jaka's village.

146
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:45,666
His village is near Solah's.

147
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,083
Since Supra's village is the farthest,
we'll go to his village next.

148
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,416
Lastly…

149
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:57,000
If I go last, Sari will be
waiting too long. It's been months.

150
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,375
If we use your plan,
we'll be sailing two months.

151
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:00,791
I have a plan. Move.

152
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:04,500
First,

153
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:08,000
we'll go to Makmur's village
since it's the closest.

154
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,916
Second, my village.

155
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,958
Then, Solah's village.
After that, Jaka's village.

156
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:18,125
Lastly, we'll go to Supra's village
since it's the farthest.

157
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,625
It's not far enough.

158
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,750
Here?

159
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,000
It's not far enough!

160
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:30,875
There.

161
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,291
Now that's what I'm talking about.
Supra's village is that far!

162
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,666
Why did you do it?

163
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,958
I'm just showing you
how far his village is.

164
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,166
My canteen?

165
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,125
My canteen.

166
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,750
- Right.
- Right.

167
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,833
My canteen.

168
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,125
Right, it's your canteen.

169
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,416
If one person is dehydrated,
everyone should also be.

170
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,166
- Come on, let's go!
- I'm so thirsty.

171
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,625
It's gonna be so hot.

172
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,708
- Sir, let's go!
- Let's go!

173
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:19,166
It'll already be dark
when we reach my village.

174
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,541
How about you stop by and eat?

175
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:24,750
Sari is a great cook!

176
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,416
Great! It's been so long
since we've had a proper meal.

177
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,333
Yes!

178
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,833
- Can she cook fried catfish?
- Of course!

179
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:33,916
Grilled fish with torch ginger?

180
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,166
That's a piece of cake, Fajrul!

181
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,583
Can she make pepes?

182
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:41,875
Tofu pepes, fish pepes, squid pepes,
you name it!

183
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:44,291
- Which one do you like?
- I like goat pepes.

184
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:47,875
That's gonna be a big pepes.
What leaf should we use to wrap it?

185
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,791
- Banana leaves, of course.
- Pardon me, Fajrul.

186
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:56,541
A banana leaf is this big, right?
We're talking about a goat!

187
00:13:56,625 --> 00:14:00,083
We have to cut up the goat, of course!

188
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,583
Enough! How about this?

189
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:05,833
Sunny side up egg with sambal.

190
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,041
Sir.

191
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,208
Making goat pepes is hard enough,
cow even more so!

192
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,791
You must be joking.

193
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,166
We've arrived at my village.

194
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,791
Is this your village?

195
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,625
It's so quiet here.

196
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,916
If it's crowded,
it's called Rambutan Village.

197
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:47,916
Where's your house?

198
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,541
Still farther in.

199
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,875
But, it is unusually quiet.

200
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,375
Kids used to play around here.

201
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,458
We're finally here.

202
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:05,291
Come on.

203
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:06,625
Watch your step.

204
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,875
- Let's go.
- Okay.

205
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:21,625
Thank you, sir.

206
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,416
- Solah, is everything okay?
- Yes.

207
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:26,250
Honey!

208
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,583
I'm home!

209
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,666
Sari!

210
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,500
I'm home!

211
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,333
Honey!

212
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:39,458
Scary!

213
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:40,750
Sari?

214
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:42,875
I'm home, honey!

215
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:45,791
Sari?

216
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:49,500
Honey?

217
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,208
Hey!

218
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,000
Sir!

219
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:55,125
Sir!

220
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,083
Boatman!

221
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,125
- Hey!
- What is it?

222
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,583
The boatman just left. He looked scared.

223
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:08,791
Look!

224
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:10,750
Hey!

225
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:12,375
Hey!

226
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,000
Are we stuck here?

227
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,666
Sari?

228
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,250
Oh, Sari!

229
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,041
Honey?

230
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,041
Honey?

231
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,291
Sari!

232
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:49,791
Kang Mak!

233
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,375
I missed you so much, honey.

234
00:16:57,541 --> 00:17:00,000
I didn't think you'd ever come back.

235
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,500
Of course not, honey.

236
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,375
I promised you.

237
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,416
I will come home.

238
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,000
Kang Mak!

239
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:21,541
What is it, honey?

240
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,125
I got shot.

241
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,416
See. But, I'm fine.

242
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,041
It's already been treated.

243
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,416
Your hand as well?

244
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,958
It was grazed by a bullet,
it's not a big deal.

245
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,750
I also have wounds on the back.

246
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:41,875
There's one from a grenade.
I also got hacked, stabbed.

247
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,000
Oh, honey!

248
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,208
I'm fine, honey.

249
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,708
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

250
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,458
For the sake of our country,

251
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,083
these wounds aren't a big deal.

252
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,625
Must be nice to have a wife.

253
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:59,916
If I had a wife waiting for me at home,

254
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,583
I would kiss and hug her.

255
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,916
Supra knows a thing or two about that.

256
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,416
Well, I've been married for a while.

257
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,125
When I come home,
I grab a hold of her head.

258
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,666
Face to face.

259
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,125
I'll lick everything.

260
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:22,333
Then, I'll squeeze her.

261
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,541
Then, I'll lick her
from the top of her head…

262
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,041
Then, I'll suck her toes.

263
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,125
Enough!

264
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,625
Honey, your stomach.

265
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,250
Why is it flat?

266
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,375
Did you have a miscarriage?

267
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,291
No!

268
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,916
No!

269
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,791
Honey, our child's right there.

270
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,750
My baby!

271
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:18,541
She's got a beautiful face like you, Sari.

272
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:22,791
Her eyes are as beautiful
as those of a fallen angel's.

273
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,041
Our child is a boy, honey.

274
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,541
I knew it. He's manly like me.

275
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,541
I'm your dad, baby.

276
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,291
I'm Daddy Makmur.

277
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,250
You can call me…

278
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,333
Pih Mak.

279
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,083
What's his name, honey?

280
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,708
The name that you've always dreamed of.

281
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:57,791
Cipluk?

282
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,250
His name is Cipluk!

283
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:07,250
I thought it would be Maxim,
or Onadio, or Vino.

284
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:08,583
But, no, it's Cipluk.

285
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,750
It's like a sound.

286
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:13,208
If he has a brother,
it will be more like a sound.

287
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,125
Like what?

288
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:19,875
If he has another sibling,
the name will be Mak Grompyang.

289
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,166
Bunch of hicks!

290
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:26,916
- You're one to talk. Your name is Solah.
- Solah is my first name.

291
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,916
My full name is Solah Vicenzio.

292
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,500
Supra is more of a hick's name!

293
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:36,500
Don't look at my first name,
look at my last name.

294
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:42,958
Supra Widodo Cokroaminoto Supratman Hatta.

295
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,416
That's a great name.

296
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:49,375
Wait a minute.
I think we know those names.

297
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,083
Say it one more time.

298
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:56,583
Supra Widodo Cokroaminoto
Gatot Subroto Hatta.

299
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,708
Now you have "Gatot Subroto"?

300
00:20:58,791 --> 00:20:59,666
I always had it!

301
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,500
No, it was "Supratman."

302
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:03,625
Guys!

303
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,500
Meet my wife, Sari.

304
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:11,833
I'm Supra Widodo Cokroaminoto
Gatot Subroto Sudirman Hatta!

305
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:14,625
- You missed the "Supratman".
- "Sudirman" now?

306
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,958
What's with you guys? It's my full name.

307
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,541
You keep changing it.

308
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:19,458
Oh, shut up!

309
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:20,708
I'm Jaka.

310
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,750
I helped Makmur when he got shot.

311
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:24,375
I'm Fajrul.

312
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:27,333
I always reminded Makmur to stay faithful.

313
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,083
There were many temptations
on the battlefield.

314
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,375
What kind of temptations?
Being kissed by a bomb?

315
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:37,500
Hi, Sari.

316
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:39,375
I'm…

317
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,666
Solah Vicenzio.

318
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:45,833
Do you possibly have a sister?

319
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,583
No, I'm an only child.

320
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:50,375
Best friend?

321
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:54,500
Or anyone who's as pretty as you?

322
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:56,500
There aren't any, Solah.

323
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:59,916
Sari is the prettiest woman
in the village.

324
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,041
When there's a competition,
she always wins.

325
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:06,416
Sari once won
the Charm of the Village competition.

326
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:10,875
<i>She was also the favorite contender</i>
<i>in the Village Flower.</i>

327
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:14,625
<i>She was also the winner of the</i>
<i>Dreamy Market Princess competition.</i>

328
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:18,833
She's won every single beauty pageant
in this village.

329
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:20,833
She is the best of the best.

330
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:24,208
She won the River Princess competition
for three years straight.

331
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:36,583
Amazing achievements!

332
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:39,625
Thank you, Solah.

333
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:42,083
Anyway, I have an announcement to make.

334
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:46,875
Now, I'm officially a father
because our child is born.

335
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:48,958
His name is amazing.

336
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:50,791
Cipluk.

337
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:54,791
His full name is Cipluk Makmur Sari.

338
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:59,625
I see. Just like a hardware store.

339
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:00,625
Furniture.

340
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,125
Don't be like that.

341
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:08,416
Cipluk is a beautiful name.

342
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,708
Cipluk has to remember his name
until he's old.

343
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:15,708
He must never forget his full name.

344
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:18,000
What?

345
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:19,166
Makmur!

346
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:22,291
The boatman left. He looked scared.

347
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:24,041
Now, we can't go home.

348
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:28,166
Why don't you guys stay here
for the night?

349
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,375
You said you wanted to try Sari's cooking!

350
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:32,125
Across the river over there

351
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:34,375
is my aunt's house.
It's vacant for some time.

352
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:36,916
So, you can stay there.

353
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,833
I agree. We will stay there.

354
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:40,750
You said you didn't want to stay.

355
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:43,000
He offered us, how can we decline?

356
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:44,875
Besides, how can we go home?

357
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:46,875
The boat already left. Swimming?

358
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:49,250
Sari.

359
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:51,833
My friends and I

360
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:53,750
want to show our utmost gratitude.

361
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:56,791
And… I love you, Sari.

362
00:23:58,166 --> 00:24:00,291
- What did you say?
- I love you, Makmur!

363
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:04,083
- You said Sari earlier.
- I love you, Sari, Makmur's wife.

364
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:05,500
Are you going to steal her?

365
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:07,791
No! I love you Sari, I love you Makmur,

366
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:09,625
I love you Cipluk and everybody!

367
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:11,500
You want to steal your friend's wife?

368
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:12,791
I'm not stealing her!

369
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:13,708
Enough!

370
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,125
It's not the time to be bickering.

371
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:23,750
Tomorrow, we'll go to the market.

372
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:26,041
Sari will cook delicious dishes for us!

373
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:27,750
- All right!
- Ali right, Mur!

374
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:29,541
Come on, honey.

375
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:49,375
I always prayed for your safety.

376
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:55,625
Your prayer made me strong
when I was fighting in the war.

377
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:02,125
I can't imagine

378
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:05,458
if you had died on the battlefield.

379
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:08,375
If I die first,

380
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:13,166
I will become a ghost and come back.

381
00:25:15,416 --> 00:25:17,416
To meet you and Cipluk.

382
00:25:21,708 --> 00:25:23,333
Stop it, I'm scared.

383
00:25:23,416 --> 00:25:24,791
You're scared, aren't you?

384
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:30,208
But, honey,

385
00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:32,541
what if…

386
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,875
I'm the one who died while waiting

387
00:25:37,875 --> 00:25:38,833
for you here?

388
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,916
I'm grateful that didn't happen.

389
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,958
Look at us now.

390
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:51,416
We're together, just like old times.

391
00:25:52,458 --> 00:25:55,208
But now, there are three of us.

392
00:25:55,916 --> 00:25:56,875
We have Cipluk.

393
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:03,958
Maybe there'll be four of us,
or five, twelve,

394
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:06,458
- a hundred…
- Come on, how can there be that many?

395
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:08,625
To light up the house, honey!

396
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:10,625
So, it won't be quiet.

397
00:26:14,958 --> 00:26:16,083
What is it?

398
00:26:17,583 --> 00:26:18,791
I'm scared, honey.

399
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:20,916
What are you scared of?

400
00:26:21,791 --> 00:26:23,750
I'm scared of us getting separated again.

401
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:27,000
Honey.

402
00:26:27,958 --> 00:26:29,916
You have to trust me.

403
00:26:30,791 --> 00:26:33,125
I will never leave you again.

404
00:26:34,958 --> 00:26:36,375
From now on,

405
00:26:37,666 --> 00:26:40,333
we will be together forever.

406
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:43,416
I promise.

407
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,583
So, don't be scared, okay?

408
00:26:48,625 --> 00:26:49,458
I'm here.

409
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:11,375
Supra!

410
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:13,375
- Wake up!
- What is it?

411
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,583
- What's that shadow? There!
- Where?

412
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,583
It's a bird.

413
00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:21,833
What do you mean a bird?

414
00:27:21,916 --> 00:27:25,166
- It's a woman.
- Fajrul, wake up.

415
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,833
What?

416
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:31,333
What shadow is that? A bird or a woman?

417
00:27:33,708 --> 00:27:35,083
- It's a dog.
- Gosh.

418
00:27:35,458 --> 00:27:36,375
A dog?

419
00:27:36,666 --> 00:27:38,541
- It's a woman!
- A bird!

420
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:41,625
It's obviously a dog.

421
00:27:42,916 --> 00:27:44,541
But, there's a bird, right?

422
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,375
You're all so loud.

423
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:48,541
Aren't you guys tired?

424
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,250
Jaka, look there.

425
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:55,333
Is that the shadow of a bird,
a dog, or a woman?

426
00:27:57,666 --> 00:27:59,458
- It's not a bird.
- See?

427
00:28:00,208 --> 00:28:01,041
It's not a dog.

428
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:01,958
See?

429
00:28:02,708 --> 00:28:03,875
It's not a woman.

430
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:06,916
It's a ghost.

431
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:09,750
A ghost?

432
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:12,208
Ghost!

433
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:13,875
Ghost!

434
00:28:14,791 --> 00:28:17,541
Jaka!

435
00:28:17,916 --> 00:28:19,041
Jaka!

436
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:24,000
Try to wake him up.

437
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,291
Jaka!

438
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:30,750
Jaka, wake up.

439
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:34,916
Jaka, wake up. Why can't you wake up?

440
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,166
Ghost!

441
00:28:39,958 --> 00:28:41,083
What are you doing?

442
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:43,708
We were tidying things up.

443
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:49,958
We're in someone's house,
we have to tidy things up.

444
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,125
- Where's the broom?
- My body is aching.

445
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:57,958
- The view was phenomenal, right?
- Yes, in the morning.

446
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:00,625
You didn't see it.

447
00:29:00,708 --> 00:29:03,333
- What do you call it? Hidden gem.
- Yes, hidden gem.

448
00:29:03,416 --> 00:29:06,958
The river was beautiful.
The water was calm and cold.

449
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:09,625
If only you didn't wake up late.

450
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:11,500
Supra! Solah!

451
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,333
Jaka, Fajrul! Come on, wake up!

452
00:29:14,791 --> 00:29:17,250
- Hey, Mur!
- Are we still going to the market?

453
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:18,291
Of course!

454
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:20,666
Come on, let's freshen up.

455
00:29:21,208 --> 00:29:23,125
I can't wait to meet Sari again.

456
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:27,083
Let's go now. If we go later,
everything will be sold out.

457
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:30,166
- You want to try Sari's cooking, right?
- Let's go! Where's Sari?

458
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:32,958
- She's got Cipluk, so she's not coming.
- Okay.

459
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:35,708
But it'll be tiring
if we have to paddle to the market.

460
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:37,666
- What should we do?
- There's a boatman.

461
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:40,458
- Let's ask him to take us there.
- That's Mr. Cecep.

462
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:42,000
Mr. Cecep!

463
00:29:42,625 --> 00:29:44,083
Mr. Cecep, do you remember me?

464
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:46,041
Can you take us to the market?

465
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:49,166
- Don't look!
- They're not used to paddling.

466
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,625
Mr. Cecep!

467
00:29:50,708 --> 00:29:51,833
Don't look!

468
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:53,333
- What's with him?
- Don't look!

469
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:55,666
- Why does he look so scared?
- Yes, Mur.

470
00:29:56,958 --> 00:30:01,750
Well, people used to say that
it's haunted around here.

471
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:04,916
But, it's an old wives' tale.

472
00:30:05,208 --> 00:30:07,166
Come on!

473
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:27,875
Mr. Wiwid!

474
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:30,416
Mr. Wiwid!

475
00:30:30,791 --> 00:30:33,250
Hey, Makmur is here!

476
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:36,916
- Makmur is here!
- Mr. Wiwid, how are you?

477
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,833
- You're famous here.
- I'm glad to know you.

478
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,166
Mr. Wiwid, Sari is going to cook us
something special

479
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,000
since we just got back from war.

480
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:48,375
Do you have any vegetables?

481
00:30:48,458 --> 00:30:52,458
I do! Tatang, grab the veggies!

482
00:30:52,541 --> 00:30:53,958
Over here!

483
00:30:54,375 --> 00:30:55,666
Thank you.

484
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:58,833
- How much is this?
- It's free, Makmur!

485
00:30:58,916 --> 00:31:02,250
What matters is Sari's happiness.

486
00:31:02,666 --> 00:31:04,041
Thank you.

487
00:31:04,125 --> 00:31:08,375
- I also need spices for these.
- I have some.

488
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:09,875
Give it to him!

489
00:31:09,958 --> 00:31:11,791
This is number one.

490
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:13,416
Do you have coffee and sugar?

491
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,791
Of course!

492
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:16,916
How about some papaya?

493
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,083
Yayat! Give it to them.

494
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:21,666
This is number three.

495
00:31:22,791 --> 00:31:23,958
Watermelon?

496
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:27,208
Yati! Where is she? Yati, give it to them!

497
00:31:27,791 --> 00:31:30,375
This is my fourth wife.

498
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:34,250
Do you have any goats?

499
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:36,250
I do!

500
00:31:37,208 --> 00:31:38,166
Give it to them!

501
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,791
Here, sir!

502
00:31:45,583 --> 00:31:47,833
How about a stripper?

503
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,333
Wait a minute.

504
00:32:01,875 --> 00:32:03,708
Stop! Enough!

505
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:08,500
I'll give Sari your regards.
Thank you, all of you!

506
00:32:08,583 --> 00:32:09,708
We'll be going now.

507
00:32:10,541 --> 00:32:11,375
Come on.

508
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:21,333
Let's take a break.
I'm still traumatized by that view.

509
00:32:21,416 --> 00:32:22,791
That mesh shirt.

510
00:32:24,541 --> 00:32:26,458
You shouldn't have asked for it.

511
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:30,250
Mbak Yu Supi!

512
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:40,750
So that you'll rest in peace.

513
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:44,375
And have a smooth journey
to the afterlife.

514
00:32:52,958 --> 00:32:54,166
She's cursing us.

515
00:32:55,166 --> 00:32:56,750
Go away.

516
00:32:58,666 --> 00:33:02,250
Don't haunt us.

517
00:33:09,958 --> 00:33:11,625
Haunt? Do you think we're ghosts?

518
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:16,291
Only ghosts can live with ghosts.

519
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,333
But, who's the ghost?

520
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:25,250
Your wife.

521
00:33:26,666 --> 00:33:29,708
Sari is dead.

522
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,791
She's a ghost!

523
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:37,000
If you don't believe me,

524
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:41,583
look through your crotch, she's a ghost!

525
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:45,875
Why are you laughing?

526
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:49,083
She's the funniest person in this village.

527
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:51,000
She says such random things.

528
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:52,833
Because she's drunk.

529
00:33:52,916 --> 00:33:54,416
I see.

530
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:56,708
But, she's also a shaman.

531
00:33:59,666 --> 00:34:01,500
Honey, I'm home!

532
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:05,333
The villagers gave us so much stuff.

533
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:07,916
You can cook straight away.

534
00:34:08,791 --> 00:34:12,250
Honey, the villagers were so nice.

535
00:34:14,041 --> 00:34:15,791
They gave us all of this for free.

536
00:34:17,166 --> 00:34:19,416
Did they say anything about me?

537
00:34:21,041 --> 00:34:22,625
No, what could they possibly say?

538
00:34:23,416 --> 00:34:27,333
They just wished you peace. That's all.

539
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,208
- Cipluk.
- It's okay. You cook, I'll get him.

540
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:39,875
What do you think about
what Mbak Yu Supi said?

541
00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:42,041
About Sari? Living with a ghost?

542
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:47,208
If we think about it, maybe the villagers
are scared of us

543
00:34:47,291 --> 00:34:48,708
because we live with a ghost.

544
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:50,791
What are you saying?

545
00:34:51,666 --> 00:34:53,166
Are you saying Sari is a ghost?

546
00:34:53,708 --> 00:34:55,625
A ghost can't be that pretty.

547
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,458
Ghosts are usually ugly.

548
00:34:59,791 --> 00:35:01,958
Why did you look at me when you said that?

549
00:35:02,375 --> 00:35:03,583
No, I looked over there.

550
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:07,583
Enough! Now, let's make sure
if Sari's a human or a ghost.

551
00:35:07,666 --> 00:35:08,541
It's easy.

552
00:35:08,958 --> 00:35:10,375
Look through the crotch.

553
00:35:11,041 --> 00:35:14,833
Let's just stop bickering.
Go, take the goat inside.

554
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:18,541
Why me? You take it.

555
00:35:18,625 --> 00:35:22,375
My waist is hurting.

556
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,333
Jrul!

557
00:35:29,875 --> 00:35:31,500
I need to poop, Solah.

558
00:35:34,958 --> 00:35:36,958
He's small but he keeps pooping.

559
00:35:39,666 --> 00:35:40,500
Jak!

560
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:43,291
I'm so tired.

561
00:35:43,625 --> 00:35:46,208
- I paddled the boat.
- So did I!

562
00:35:46,791 --> 00:35:49,000
- I was in the back…
- Enough!

563
00:35:50,458 --> 00:35:52,125
It's not the time to be bickering.

564
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:57,041
Now, pick one. Who will massage me

565
00:35:57,125 --> 00:35:59,125
and who will take the goat?

566
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:00,291
Jaka, massage me.

567
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,166
Why did you ask us to choose, then?

568
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:10,250
You're already holding the goat.
I'd smell like a goat if you massaged me.

569
00:36:10,916 --> 00:36:14,833
Just check if she's a ghost or not.

570
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,791
Check through the crotch.

571
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:50,500
What are you doing, Solah?

572
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:54,000
I'm about to eat the goat.
I mean, feed the goat.

573
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:55,916
I mean, feed you the goat.

574
00:36:56,375 --> 00:37:00,000
I mean, I'm giving you the goat
so that you'll cook it for us.

575
00:37:09,208 --> 00:37:10,666
Sari.

576
00:37:11,708 --> 00:37:14,000
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to…

577
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:17,125
Can you please get some banana leaves?

578
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,500
Not just banana leaves,
I can even get guava leaves,

579
00:37:22,875 --> 00:37:27,208
door leaves,
or any kind of leaves for you.

580
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:29,916
But, why would you need those, right?

581
00:37:34,625 --> 00:37:35,916
I'll go get them.

582
00:37:41,416 --> 00:37:45,916
If Sari is a ghost, then,
that would make their son a ghost too.

583
00:37:46,708 --> 00:37:48,166
Of course not.

584
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:51,833
If that's the case, I'm sure Makmur
would realize that by now.

585
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:54,750
But, the villagers' expressions…

586
00:37:55,416 --> 00:37:57,458
Why are you worrying about that?

587
00:37:57,541 --> 00:37:59,083
What do you mean by ghost?

588
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:04,166
No one. The people at the market said it.

589
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,458
You believed them?

590
00:38:05,541 --> 00:38:08,416
Of course not. How can we?

591
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,875
How can such a cute child be a ghost?

592
00:38:10,958 --> 00:38:15,208
You're right, he's cute. Cipluk!

593
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:16,708
Cipluk!

594
00:38:18,166 --> 00:38:23,166
He's so handsome!

595
00:38:23,708 --> 00:38:25,166
- Uncle Jaka!
- Cipluk!

596
00:38:27,458 --> 00:38:28,958
You're really good with…

597
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:30,916
With who?

598
00:38:34,416 --> 00:38:35,250
Makmur!

599
00:38:36,541 --> 00:38:38,750
What are you guys doing?

600
00:38:38,833 --> 00:38:43,125
Are you learning how to hold Cipluk?
Here, hold him.

601
00:38:48,208 --> 00:38:50,708
Jaka, come with me.

602
00:38:51,958 --> 00:38:53,208
They're funny, right?

603
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,708
Uncle Supra.

604
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:16,333
- Damn it!
- Damn you!

605
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:18,458
- What are you doing?
- I'm pooping.

606
00:39:18,875 --> 00:39:19,916
Don't poop there!

607
00:39:20,666 --> 00:39:22,166
Leave me alone, will you?

608
00:39:23,666 --> 00:39:27,916
Hey! That's no different.
Go poop by the river!

609
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:29,250
It's too far!

610
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:33,583
- You're small, you don't need to poop!
- Why can't I?

611
00:39:33,666 --> 00:39:36,041
Look at you, you're big
and you never poop!

612
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:38,500
- None of your business!
- When did you last poop?

613
00:39:38,583 --> 00:39:39,666
- Yesterday!
- Today?

614
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:40,958
- Not yet!
- Let's go.

615
00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:42,291
- What?
- Let's have a race.

616
00:39:42,375 --> 00:39:44,416
No! Why would I have a poop race with you?

617
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:49,083
- It smells. You already pooped.
- Not yet.

618
00:39:49,791 --> 00:39:51,250
Your mouth smells like poop.

619
00:39:51,625 --> 00:39:52,583
See, it smells.

620
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:03,416
I was sure I was holding Cipluk.

621
00:40:03,958 --> 00:40:07,791
I even played with him.
I remember his face clearly.

622
00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:11,416
I know, right? Out of nowhere,
it turned into a banana stem.

623
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,333
Hey!

624
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:18,458
I was looking for you,
turns out you're here.

625
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,375
- Have you checked Sari?
- I have.

626
00:40:20,458 --> 00:40:21,666
She's not a ghost.

627
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,625
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

628
00:40:24,333 --> 00:40:25,166
What is it?

629
00:40:35,083 --> 00:40:36,375
He's such a nuisance.

630
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:40,291
It's normal for a human to poop.

631
00:41:16,791 --> 00:41:17,791
Help!

632
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,291
It's Fajrul's voice.

633
00:41:21,625 --> 00:41:22,958
What's wrong with him?

634
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,458
Fajrul!

635
00:41:27,166 --> 00:41:28,916
Jrul, where are you?

636
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,208
Stop messing around.

637
00:41:31,666 --> 00:41:32,541
Jrul!

638
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:35,375
Fajrul!

639
00:41:37,125 --> 00:41:38,583
Something just moved.

640
00:41:38,666 --> 00:41:39,791
Is that him?

641
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:41,541
Jrul!

642
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,166
Fajrul!

643
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,541
No, that's a tree.

644
00:41:44,625 --> 00:41:45,833
How can a tree move?

645
00:41:45,916 --> 00:41:48,166
- Fajrul!
- Maybe it's the wind.

646
00:41:49,166 --> 00:41:50,000
Fajrul!

647
00:41:53,333 --> 00:41:55,041
Goodness!

648
00:41:55,125 --> 00:41:56,125
What happened to you?

649
00:41:56,208 --> 00:41:59,125
- He's allergic to something.
- It's your fault for not sharing.

650
00:41:59,208 --> 00:42:01,833
You ate crabs, didn't you?

651
00:42:01,916 --> 00:42:04,625
No, it must be shrimps!

652
00:42:04,708 --> 00:42:08,916
Shrimps grilled with honey is great…

653
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:12,958
Clams! That's it!

654
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:17,416
- What is it?
- What?

655
00:42:29,916 --> 00:42:32,333
I don't understand. Say it again.

656
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Medan?

657
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:40,625
No!

658
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:42,583
Sticky rice!

659
00:42:43,666 --> 00:42:45,958
Medan sticky rice with durian!

660
00:42:47,291 --> 00:42:49,625
- That's nice!
- With coffee…

661
00:42:50,125 --> 00:42:52,083
Why do you keep kicking me?

662
00:42:52,166 --> 00:42:53,166
What is it?

663
00:42:57,625 --> 00:42:58,791
Is it Tarzan?

664
00:43:08,208 --> 00:43:10,291
{\an8}Sari.

665
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,083
Ghost?

666
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:21,541
Sari is a ghost?

667
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,583
Don't talk nonsense.

668
00:43:24,666 --> 00:43:27,541
I've already checked her crotch,
she's not a ghost!

669
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,500
Come again?

670
00:43:29,583 --> 00:43:32,041
You told me to check her crotch.

671
00:43:32,125 --> 00:43:34,583
Show me how you did it.

672
00:43:34,958 --> 00:43:36,708
- Pretend that you're Sari.
- I'm Sari.

673
00:43:36,791 --> 00:43:37,625
Yes.

674
00:43:37,958 --> 00:43:39,291
I did this.

675
00:43:39,958 --> 00:43:41,791
You're a pervert!

676
00:43:41,875 --> 00:43:45,500
You should check from your crotch,
not hers.

677
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:46,416
Like this.

678
00:43:49,166 --> 00:43:51,416
The food's ready. Come, let's eat.

679
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:58,708
What happened to your face?

680
00:44:01,416 --> 00:44:03,541
I think wasps did this.

681
00:44:05,916 --> 00:44:08,000
Poor him, he's so ugly now.

682
00:44:08,083 --> 00:44:09,083
Yes.

683
00:44:09,166 --> 00:44:10,583
It's okay, we'll treat you.

684
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:14,833
My wife has finished cooking, let's eat.

685
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:18,458
Mur, I think we'll just be going home.

686
00:44:18,541 --> 00:44:20,291
What's the rush?

687
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:23,958
The food is ready.
Come on, Sari would be sad.

688
00:44:24,041 --> 00:44:26,375
- We're going to…
- Do yoga.

689
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:28,041
Yes, right!

690
00:44:28,125 --> 00:44:30,958
We're going to do yoga.
We want to seek inner peace.

691
00:44:31,041 --> 00:44:33,000
- To control Jaka's temper.
- Yes.

692
00:44:33,666 --> 00:44:36,791
- Anyway, we'll be going now.
- Okay.

693
00:44:36,875 --> 00:44:38,541
I'll bring you the medicine.

694
00:44:42,041 --> 00:44:44,333
Sari S… What did the rest say?

695
00:44:50,625 --> 00:44:53,916
Sari is Sari!

696
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,291
Sari. S-A-R-I.

697
00:44:56,375 --> 00:44:59,583
That's right!

698
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:00,875
Yeah.

699
00:45:07,208 --> 00:45:10,958
Wait. If Sari really is a ghost,

700
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:13,291
we should leave this village.

701
00:45:14,083 --> 00:45:16,958
I've had a bad feeling since yesterday.

702
00:45:17,041 --> 00:45:19,541
But, how can we leave Makmur alone?

703
00:45:24,166 --> 00:45:26,833
I know she's his wife.

704
00:45:27,875 --> 00:45:30,625
Someone needs to tell him
that Sari is a ghost.

705
00:45:32,083 --> 00:45:34,666
Do you have the heart to leave Makmur?

706
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:36,708
Makmur helped us once.

707
00:45:36,791 --> 00:45:39,666
And we were in the same squad.

708
00:45:39,958 --> 00:45:43,083
We're like brothers to him.

709
00:45:44,125 --> 00:45:46,791
I know that, but we're soldiers.

710
00:45:47,041 --> 00:45:49,958
We were trained to fight humans,
not ghosts!

711
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:50,958
Wait!

712
00:45:53,666 --> 00:45:55,333
Good thing you haven't left.

713
00:45:55,416 --> 00:45:58,000
- I want to…
- Makmur, we've got to tell you something.

714
00:45:58,083 --> 00:46:00,416
- Don't be surprised.
- Don't be mad, too.

715
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:02,500
Don't be vengeful as well.

716
00:46:02,583 --> 00:46:04,208
What exactly is going on?

717
00:46:04,916 --> 00:46:06,333
Actually…

718
00:46:07,666 --> 00:46:09,000
Solah is going to tell you.

719
00:46:10,416 --> 00:46:11,250
Why me?

720
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:17,833
Mur.

721
00:46:18,791 --> 00:46:22,916
We've been friends for a long time.
I've gathered some evidence.

722
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,708
The truth is…

723
00:46:26,916 --> 00:46:28,250
Supra is going to tell you!

724
00:46:29,083 --> 00:46:30,458
Why is it so hard to say it?

725
00:46:30,833 --> 00:46:31,666
Mur.

726
00:46:45,166 --> 00:46:46,125
What did he say?

727
00:46:47,166 --> 00:46:48,458
There, there.

728
00:46:48,541 --> 00:46:50,333
I know it's hard for you to talk.

729
00:46:50,416 --> 00:46:52,375
Supra, you tell him.

730
00:46:54,916 --> 00:46:59,000
Mur. I'm sorry, but, Sari is…

731
00:47:01,083 --> 00:47:02,708
- Pretty!
- Yes, she is.

732
00:47:03,291 --> 00:47:05,458
- Pretty!
- She's always been pretty.

733
00:47:05,541 --> 00:47:10,833
I told you, she always won
beauty pageants.

734
00:47:10,916 --> 00:47:13,500
I thought you were going to say
something weird!

735
00:47:14,833 --> 00:47:18,041
I was going to give you this oil.

736
00:47:18,625 --> 00:47:20,791
Use this on your wounds, okay?

737
00:47:22,166 --> 00:47:23,291
Come on, let's eat.

738
00:47:23,625 --> 00:47:24,833
The food is ready.

739
00:47:24,916 --> 00:47:27,208
Didn't you want to try my cooking?

740
00:47:29,583 --> 00:47:31,583
She already cooked for you.

741
00:47:31,666 --> 00:47:33,666
She'll be disappointed
if you don't try it.

742
00:47:34,375 --> 00:47:36,208
She will be vengeful if you don't.

743
00:47:46,458 --> 00:47:51,125
See, I was right.
Your face is a lot better now.

744
00:47:51,208 --> 00:47:53,291
Makmur. I think Sari is…

745
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:57,291
But, you still can't speak clearly.

746
00:47:58,291 --> 00:47:59,625
Slow down.

747
00:48:00,666 --> 00:48:01,875
Sari?

748
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,708
Sari has…

749
00:48:06,791 --> 00:48:09,333
- Sari has…
- Cooked.

750
00:48:11,333 --> 00:48:12,750
Sari has cooked.

751
00:48:13,166 --> 00:48:16,541
I already told you,
she was going to cook today.

752
00:48:23,708 --> 00:48:25,500
Please enjoy.

753
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:31,458
This looks…

754
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,958
like it's high in cholesterol.

755
00:48:34,875 --> 00:48:36,791
I have a weak heart.

756
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:38,666
I can't eat high-cholesterol foods.

757
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,458
I also have diabetes.

758
00:48:41,541 --> 00:48:44,416
So, I can't eat high-sugar foods.

759
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:48,208
I have cholesterol, diabetes,
high blood pressure.

760
00:48:48,291 --> 00:48:50,000
Eating this will make me mad!

761
00:48:51,333 --> 00:48:52,708
Come on, don't be shy.

762
00:48:52,791 --> 00:48:54,750
I know all of you are hungry.

763
00:48:54,833 --> 00:48:57,958
Just try it first,
I'm sure you'll like it.

764
00:49:02,708 --> 00:49:03,791
It's delicious!

765
00:49:04,208 --> 00:49:07,125
It's your loss if you don't try it.
Just one bite.

766
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:10,416
I will be happy
if you at least have one bite.

767
00:49:10,791 --> 00:49:16,250
That means you appreciate what I prepared
for Makmur's good friends.

768
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:25,583
Supra.

769
00:49:26,625 --> 00:49:27,833
How do you like it?

770
00:49:40,291 --> 00:49:41,125
Delicious.

771
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,375
It's delicious. Scrumptious.

772
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:45,208
Thank you.

773
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:47,625
Jaka, come on, have some.

774
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:49,583
Please give us your review.

775
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:55,625
It's yummy!

776
00:49:56,125 --> 00:49:57,916
It's amazing!

777
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:00,625
Honey, Jaka is a peculiar man.

778
00:50:00,708 --> 00:50:03,791
If he likes something, he will be on fire!

779
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:05,666
That means he's being honest.

780
00:50:06,791 --> 00:50:08,833
It's your turn, Solah Vincenzio.

781
00:50:09,375 --> 00:50:12,666
Please give us a detailed testimony.

782
00:50:40,875 --> 00:50:42,083
The texture is delicate.

783
00:50:42,541 --> 00:50:45,541
It's full of flavor. Salty, sweet, spicy.

784
00:50:45,833 --> 00:50:47,416
It melts on my tongue!

785
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:51,333
Fajrul.

786
00:50:52,041 --> 00:50:52,875
I'm sorry,

787
00:50:54,125 --> 00:50:57,791
I know it's hard for you to speak,
but, as a closing statement,

788
00:50:58,083 --> 00:51:00,208
please give us your conclusion.

789
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,916
- He said he loves it.
- He wants to have more.

790
00:51:34,541 --> 00:51:35,416
Give him more.

791
00:52:01,791 --> 00:52:02,625
See?

792
00:52:03,625 --> 00:52:06,791
He loves it so much that he's crying.

793
00:52:10,875 --> 00:52:13,541
As our gratitude,

794
00:52:13,625 --> 00:52:15,208
we prepared desserts.

795
00:52:16,125 --> 00:52:17,708
I will also make you some coffee.

796
00:52:18,583 --> 00:52:20,416
Wait here, I'll get it.

797
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,458
- Mur.
- It's fine.

798
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:24,333
Makmur.

799
00:52:50,833 --> 00:52:53,875
I have to go, I have to finish my laundry.

800
00:52:53,958 --> 00:52:57,541
After that, I have to iron the clothes.

801
00:52:57,625 --> 00:53:01,791
After that, I have to fold the clothes
and put them in the drawer.

802
00:53:18,375 --> 00:53:19,500
Peace be upon you.

803
00:53:27,458 --> 00:53:29,208
- Hurry up, Jrul!
- Have mercy, Sari.

804
00:53:29,291 --> 00:53:30,333
She's behind you!

805
00:53:32,833 --> 00:53:33,666
Hurry!

806
00:53:38,541 --> 00:53:39,375
Hurry!

807
00:53:41,708 --> 00:53:42,791
Sari!

808
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,333
Why are we not moving forward?

809
00:53:48,416 --> 00:53:49,416
Hurry up!

810
00:53:49,791 --> 00:53:51,458
Why are we going in circles?

811
00:53:55,208 --> 00:53:56,208
We meet again!

812
00:53:57,083 --> 00:54:00,416
You must stop trying to ruin
my happiness with Makmur!

813
00:54:02,375 --> 00:54:03,208
Promise me!

814
00:54:03,625 --> 00:54:04,583
We promise!

815
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:05,958
<i>Pwomish!</i>

816
00:54:07,708 --> 00:54:08,541
What?

817
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:10,291
<i>Pwomish!</i>

818
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:16,750
I told you.

819
00:54:25,041 --> 00:54:26,791
Here come the desserts!

820
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Where's everyone?

821
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:31,166
I got the durian.

822
00:54:32,166 --> 00:54:34,166
They said they wanted some coffee.

823
00:54:38,625 --> 00:54:40,250
They just left.

824
00:54:41,625 --> 00:54:42,666
They're scared.

825
00:54:43,208 --> 00:54:44,666
Scared of what?

826
00:54:45,916 --> 00:54:50,041
They believe what the villagers said,
that I'm a ghost.

827
00:54:57,916 --> 00:55:00,666
Because of Fajrul,
we had to speak like that.

828
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:03,583
I also don't want it.
Do you think I enjoy it?

829
00:55:08,333 --> 00:55:09,458
I can speak.

830
00:55:11,375 --> 00:55:12,416
You're healed!

831
00:55:16,166 --> 00:55:17,000
I'm healed!

832
00:55:17,958 --> 00:55:19,791
<i>Pwaise bee to Gud!</i>

833
00:55:20,208 --> 00:55:22,875
- I'm kidding.
- Let's go home.

834
00:55:32,125 --> 00:55:34,500
By the way, how about Makmur?

835
00:55:35,083 --> 00:55:36,125
What do you mean?

836
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:40,166
He doesn't know his wife is a ghost.

837
00:55:40,791 --> 00:55:42,458
Let's just go home.

838
00:55:46,166 --> 00:55:47,416
Who's that?

839
00:55:49,666 --> 00:55:50,750
What if it's Sari?

840
00:55:55,666 --> 00:55:56,791
Don't push me.

841
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,083
There's no one?

842
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,208
No one.

843
00:56:06,708 --> 00:56:08,750
- There's no one.
- Close it!

844
00:56:13,666 --> 00:56:14,916
You're all traitors.

845
00:56:15,833 --> 00:56:17,416
I thought you were my friends.

846
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:20,500
You're no different to those villagers
calling my wife a ghost!

847
00:56:20,583 --> 00:56:21,833
Sari is dead, Mur.

848
00:56:22,333 --> 00:56:24,083
The villagers are suspicious of us.

849
00:56:24,166 --> 00:56:27,041
So, you trust them more than you trust me?

850
00:56:27,375 --> 00:56:31,041
- This isn't about trust…
- They fooled you!

851
00:56:31,125 --> 00:56:34,333
You're the one being fooled.
You're blinded by love.

852
00:56:34,416 --> 00:56:36,791
- Your wife and son are ghosts!
- You're the ghost!

853
00:56:37,625 --> 00:56:38,875
Makmur!

854
00:56:40,125 --> 00:56:43,333
We're only like this
because we care about you, Makmur.

855
00:56:43,875 --> 00:56:46,291
Makmur, we're brothers.

856
00:56:46,833 --> 00:56:50,750
Brothers for life and death forever.

857
00:56:51,666 --> 00:56:52,500
Like that?

858
00:56:53,083 --> 00:56:54,166
Brothers.

859
00:56:55,458 --> 00:56:57,250
You can't even be my friends.

860
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
You all came here to ruin my happiness.

861
00:57:05,583 --> 00:57:07,375
I don't need friends like you.

862
00:57:08,791 --> 00:57:10,166
Leave.

863
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:15,916
- Mur!
- Makmur!

864
00:57:16,541 --> 00:57:17,625
Let him be.

865
00:57:18,666 --> 00:57:19,916
He's blinded by love.

866
00:57:23,208 --> 00:57:25,083
So, we're just leaving him?

867
00:57:28,375 --> 00:57:29,208
No.

868
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:33,875
We're brothers.

869
00:57:37,416 --> 00:57:38,875
I have another plan.

870
00:57:39,833 --> 00:57:41,291
What is it?

871
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:51,125
I don't have one.

872
00:57:51,458 --> 00:57:53,250
Jak, make a plan.

873
00:57:56,791 --> 00:57:58,125
How about this…

874
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,500
What? We'll see her?

875
00:58:11,291 --> 00:58:13,958
They crossed the line
thinking you're a ghost.

876
00:58:16,791 --> 00:58:20,041
You were so kind to them.
You made them food, you let them stay.

877
00:58:22,041 --> 00:58:23,750
I can't believe they changed.

878
00:58:25,833 --> 00:58:27,458
Even though they have left,

879
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,750
the villagers will
still talk behind our backs.

880
00:58:31,416 --> 00:58:33,666
Don't worry about it.

881
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,416
I believe you.

882
00:58:37,416 --> 00:58:39,208
Who cares about what they say?

883
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,125
What matters is us.

884
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,500
Let's go to the night market.

885
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:52,250
We'll show them that nothing changes.

886
00:58:52,791 --> 00:58:56,250
Makmur and Sari are still the same couple.

887
00:58:56,791 --> 00:58:57,875
What do you think?

888
00:58:59,875 --> 00:59:01,166
What about Cipluk?

889
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:05,208
It's okay. We'll come home
before he wakes up.

890
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,250
Come on, let's change.

891
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:21,708
Look at that, honey.

892
00:59:21,791 --> 00:59:24,208
- Everything looks so fun.
- Wait for me!

893
00:59:24,291 --> 00:59:26,166
Let's ride this first!

894
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:30,916
My balloon.

895
00:59:31,458 --> 00:59:35,125
It's okay, we'll buy you a new one.

896
00:59:35,208 --> 00:59:36,333
Don't be sad.

897
00:59:36,916 --> 00:59:38,208
Here's your balloon.

898
00:59:40,541 --> 00:59:41,541
Thank you.

899
00:59:43,083 --> 00:59:44,250
You're so swift.

900
00:59:45,541 --> 00:59:48,000
You naughty boy, I told you not to run.

901
00:59:48,083 --> 00:59:51,333
You'll get kidnapped… by a ghost! Come on.

902
00:59:54,291 --> 00:59:56,958
That woman. How can there be ghosts
at the night market?

903
00:59:58,750 --> 00:59:59,708
Honey.

904
01:00:00,041 --> 01:00:03,083
- Are you still going to wear that mask?
- Why?

905
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:06,416
Nothing. You're still beautiful.

906
01:00:08,208 --> 01:00:09,041
Come.

907
01:00:19,833 --> 01:00:21,291
Once again!

908
01:00:22,666 --> 01:00:24,083
Come on!

909
01:00:24,166 --> 01:00:25,541
It's hard!

910
01:00:25,625 --> 01:00:27,791
It's okay, honey.

911
01:00:47,416 --> 01:00:50,958
Sir, stop the ride!

912
01:00:51,041 --> 01:00:53,333
Do you want to stop?

913
01:00:55,791 --> 01:00:57,250
Honey!

914
01:00:58,791 --> 01:00:59,958
Honey!

915
01:01:01,041 --> 01:01:03,708
Watch, I'll hit all of them.

916
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:08,333
It's okay, honey.

917
01:01:36,416 --> 01:01:37,500
Fireworks!

918
01:01:40,583 --> 01:01:41,833
So beautiful!

919
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:53,250
Honey!

920
01:01:54,125 --> 01:01:56,791
I did it!

921
01:01:57,375 --> 01:02:00,708
I got a doll! It's so cute!
Thank you, sir!

922
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:03,666
- It's for Cipluk!
- Yeah!

923
01:02:11,875 --> 01:02:14,125
See, there's too many people here.

924
01:02:14,791 --> 01:02:16,833
We might not be able to ride it.

925
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,875
Let's ride something else
before it gets too late.

926
01:02:21,625 --> 01:02:22,625
Fireworks!

927
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:25,583
Where, honey?

928
01:02:26,458 --> 01:02:27,583
There aren't any.

929
01:02:28,333 --> 01:02:29,500
- Sari!
- Run!

930
01:02:32,083 --> 01:02:37,333
We're being lied to.

931
01:02:39,541 --> 01:02:41,541
Honey, it's not crowded anymore.

932
01:02:42,208 --> 01:02:43,166
Let's go.

933
01:02:44,041 --> 01:02:44,875
Let's go.

934
01:02:47,583 --> 01:02:50,250
- Just like old times, right?
- Yes.

935
01:03:00,541 --> 01:03:01,375
Honey.

936
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:06,541
You know that I love you, right?

937
01:03:09,375 --> 01:03:10,750
Yes, honey.

938
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,958
Do you still love me?

939
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:16,791
Why would you ask that?

940
01:03:18,041 --> 01:03:20,333
You know how I feel about you.

941
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:23,583
How do you feel about me?

942
01:03:24,041 --> 01:03:26,041
I love you so much.

943
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:31,541
How much?

944
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:34,791
Very, very much.

945
01:03:36,125 --> 01:03:37,750
I love you too.

946
01:03:39,125 --> 01:03:40,333
Even more than that.

947
01:03:40,958 --> 01:03:43,416
Very, very, very much.

948
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:51,083
Kang Mak.

949
01:03:53,083 --> 01:03:53,916
We…

950
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:57,291
made a promise

951
01:03:58,583 --> 01:04:00,500
not to keep secrets between us.

952
01:04:01,041 --> 01:04:01,958
That's right.

953
01:04:04,958 --> 01:04:05,958
The truth is…

954
01:04:09,833 --> 01:04:11,666
there's something I want to tell you.

955
01:04:13,458 --> 01:04:15,708
What? Just tell me.

956
01:04:16,958 --> 01:04:18,125
But can you promise me?

957
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:20,791
Promise you what?

958
01:04:21,833 --> 01:04:22,833
Promise me…

959
01:04:25,125 --> 01:04:26,583
that if I die first,

960
01:04:28,083 --> 01:04:30,541
you'll carry on with your life.

961
01:04:31,125 --> 01:04:33,875
You can fall in love with another woman.

962
01:04:34,375 --> 01:04:36,416
You can marry another woman.

963
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:37,333
No.

964
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:39,208
I can't promise you that.

965
01:04:39,875 --> 01:04:42,458
- Why not?
- What are you talking about?

966
01:04:44,791 --> 01:04:47,250
You know I can't live without you.

967
01:04:48,166 --> 01:04:51,375
We promised to be together
in life and in death.

968
01:04:52,625 --> 01:04:54,375
With Makmur comes Sari.

969
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,791
Where there's Sari, there's Makmur.

970
01:05:06,041 --> 01:05:07,916
You can't die first.

971
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:13,416
Listen, Kang.

972
01:05:13,708 --> 01:05:14,583
Fireworks.

973
01:05:16,125 --> 01:05:17,291
Where?

974
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,250
In your eyes.

975
01:05:26,708 --> 01:05:27,541
Stop it.

976
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:30,750
Let's stop talking about death.

977
01:05:32,916 --> 01:05:35,333
Let's focus on the present. We're alive.

978
01:05:37,875 --> 01:05:40,750
We can still go on ferris wheels together.

979
01:05:45,083 --> 01:05:47,375
Why don't we enjoy the moment

980
01:05:49,583 --> 01:05:51,625
so we can have wonderful memories?

981
01:05:52,583 --> 01:05:54,708
Memories that will last forever.

982
01:06:25,375 --> 01:06:27,625
Finally.

983
01:06:28,291 --> 01:06:30,208
You all made it here.

984
01:06:35,958 --> 01:06:38,250
{\an8}Mbak Yu Supi, you're amazing.

985
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:40,375
So you're of royal descent.

986
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:46,708
This… Kang Mas Pusi. Who is he?

987
01:06:46,791 --> 01:06:49,583
He's my twin brother.

988
01:06:51,791 --> 01:06:52,958
He's also a shaman.

989
01:06:53,541 --> 01:06:56,291
You're here because
you have a request, right?

990
01:07:00,541 --> 01:07:02,208
You seek my help, yes?

991
01:07:04,458 --> 01:07:05,416
Yes.

992
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:06,583
To get rid of a ghost?

993
01:07:06,666 --> 01:07:07,833
Yes.

994
01:07:14,166 --> 01:07:15,166
What's with her?

995
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:17,708
Inside that pouch is black sticky rice.

996
01:07:17,791 --> 01:07:18,750
Grab it.

997
01:07:18,958 --> 01:07:20,125
- Ka.
- Jak.

998
01:07:20,208 --> 01:07:21,083
You do it, Ka.

999
01:07:22,375 --> 01:07:23,458
Black sticky rice.

1000
01:07:24,416 --> 01:07:25,583
Excuse me, Mbah Yu.

1001
01:07:28,833 --> 01:07:31,666
Not that! That's a lizard rice cake!

1002
01:07:31,916 --> 01:07:33,000
Lizard rice cake?

1003
01:07:35,041 --> 01:07:35,875
That one.

1004
01:07:40,333 --> 01:07:42,958
When you pass by the ghost,

1005
01:07:43,458 --> 01:07:44,375
throw it!

1006
01:07:44,458 --> 01:07:46,125
It will hurt the ghost.

1007
01:07:46,958 --> 01:07:48,833
Yes. Thank you, Mbah Yu.

1008
01:07:50,541 --> 01:07:51,375
Hey.

1009
01:07:52,041 --> 01:07:53,958
Wait a moment.

1010
01:07:54,041 --> 01:07:57,541
Nothing comes for free in this world.

1011
01:07:57,625 --> 01:07:59,291
Wouldn't you agree?

1012
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:02,208
We don't have any money, Mbah Yu.

1013
01:08:02,291 --> 01:08:05,875
Not everything has to be paid with money.

1014
01:08:06,458 --> 01:08:07,291
So…

1015
01:08:08,583 --> 01:08:09,750
How should we pay you?

1016
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:11,750
With a kiss.

1017
01:08:28,458 --> 01:08:29,708
With you.

1018
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,333
With you.

1019
01:08:33,916 --> 01:08:36,583
Yes, you. A kiss with you.

1020
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:54,583
Was it good?

1021
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,375
There. Now you may go.

1022
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:02,875
Thank you, Mbah Yu.

1023
01:09:07,958 --> 01:09:08,791
Come on.

1024
01:09:16,125 --> 01:09:17,958
Are you sure you want to go in?

1025
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,708
You're scared of ghosts.

1026
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:24,541
That was before I went to war.

1027
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:26,833
But things have changed.

1028
01:09:27,958 --> 01:09:29,958
Soldiers aren't afraid of ghosts.

1029
01:09:32,375 --> 01:09:33,375
No way.

1030
01:09:34,791 --> 01:09:36,750
- Come on.
- Okay.

1031
01:09:36,833 --> 01:09:38,458
HAUNTED HOUSE

1032
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:48,250
A ghost!

1033
01:09:48,666 --> 01:09:51,250
Calm down, Sari!

1034
01:09:51,333 --> 01:09:52,833
Don't panic!

1035
01:09:57,708 --> 01:09:59,583
Don't panic, honey.

1036
01:10:10,416 --> 01:10:11,833
You startled me!

1037
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:14,625
The organizers are insane!
It shouldn't be this scary!

1038
01:10:15,208 --> 01:10:17,083
My poor wife has a weak heart!

1039
01:10:17,541 --> 01:10:18,375
You're mad!

1040
01:10:20,791 --> 01:10:21,666
Are you okay?

1041
01:10:22,916 --> 01:10:23,750
Yes.

1042
01:10:27,166 --> 01:10:29,875
I know if we go near this pocong,

1043
01:10:29,958 --> 01:10:31,458
it will jump at us.

1044
01:10:45,041 --> 01:10:46,250
It's a pillow.

1045
01:10:47,083 --> 01:10:48,500
I'm not scared of this.

1046
01:10:50,833 --> 01:10:52,125
Have mercy, Cong!

1047
01:10:52,208 --> 01:10:54,458
Have mercy, Cong!

1048
01:11:00,041 --> 01:11:01,250
Why did he run away?

1049
01:11:02,875 --> 01:11:05,000
He even tumbled and crashed…

1050
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:07,333
into the wall.

1051
01:11:09,041 --> 01:11:11,541
He must've been startled
because of my shouting.

1052
01:11:14,583 --> 01:11:16,333
Don't be afraid, Sari.

1053
01:11:31,916 --> 01:11:33,000
Where did he go?

1054
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:35,958
He's afraid of me.

1055
01:11:47,208 --> 01:11:49,416
- Stop crying.
- She's scared.

1056
01:11:50,916 --> 01:11:52,125
You're bothering us.

1057
01:11:53,166 --> 01:11:54,208
What's that now?

1058
01:12:05,083 --> 01:12:06,833
She's scared. What a dumbass.

1059
01:12:08,416 --> 01:12:11,500
What's this doing in a haunted house?

1060
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:16,625
Trying to scare me? It's not working.

1061
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:30,833
Why'd they keep the little one
for the end?

1062
01:12:31,541 --> 01:12:33,708
Come on, you can do it.

1063
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:36,958
You can do it, come on.

1064
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:44,833
All good.

1065
01:12:46,166 --> 01:12:47,416
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1066
01:12:48,416 --> 01:12:49,416
The last one.

1067
01:12:49,875 --> 01:12:51,125
A forest setup.

1068
01:12:51,583 --> 01:12:53,416
There's no reason to be scared.

1069
01:12:53,833 --> 01:12:55,250
We live in a forest.

1070
01:12:55,791 --> 01:12:57,583
It'll just be snakes at worst.

1071
01:12:58,083 --> 01:13:01,041
I'll go check and make sure
it's safe for you.

1072
01:13:20,291 --> 01:13:21,833
Let's go!

1073
01:13:26,583 --> 01:13:27,416
Kang?

1074
01:13:29,541 --> 01:13:30,375
Kang Mak?

1075
01:13:34,375 --> 01:13:35,208
Kang?

1076
01:13:35,833 --> 01:13:36,708
Kang Mak?

1077
01:13:41,458 --> 01:13:42,291
Kang!

1078
01:13:48,083 --> 01:13:49,041
Don't hurt me.

1079
01:13:52,791 --> 01:13:54,750
Knock him out so we can carry him easily.

1080
01:14:00,166 --> 01:14:01,541
You guys again?

1081
01:14:02,541 --> 01:14:04,416
Why did you follow me here?

1082
01:14:05,958 --> 01:14:07,333
What are you doing now?

1083
01:14:08,625 --> 01:14:09,458
Stop!

1084
01:14:10,166 --> 01:14:11,666
Leave me and Sari alone.

1085
01:14:12,458 --> 01:14:14,166
Go back to your own villages.

1086
01:14:15,125 --> 01:14:16,500
You're getting on my nerves.

1087
01:14:28,708 --> 01:14:30,708
- Hurry up.
- Tie him up.

1088
01:14:37,875 --> 01:14:39,833
Hey. The door is locked.

1089
01:14:39,916 --> 01:14:41,333
Are you sure?

1090
01:14:46,416 --> 01:14:47,750
Seriously? Let me try.

1091
01:14:48,791 --> 01:14:50,458
Crap! What do we do?

1092
01:14:52,375 --> 01:14:55,708
We have to resort to using strategy 21.

1093
01:14:57,416 --> 01:14:59,833
Shed the insect's skin.

1094
01:14:59,916 --> 01:15:02,333
Isn't it dangerous? It's a haunted house.

1095
01:15:05,291 --> 01:15:06,541
There's no other way.

1096
01:16:23,375 --> 01:16:25,500
Mommy.

1097
01:16:48,666 --> 01:16:49,500
Who are you?

1098
01:16:53,458 --> 01:16:55,333
I'm…

1099
01:16:56,458 --> 01:16:57,875
Suprawati.

1100
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:00,458
Hadiningrum.

1101
01:17:23,791 --> 01:17:27,916
There's absolutely no way
I'm trying this strategy again.

1102
01:17:29,833 --> 01:17:31,833
And you call yourself a soldier?

1103
01:17:32,916 --> 01:17:34,291
Use your normal voice.

1104
01:17:35,125 --> 01:17:36,791
And you call yourself a soldier?

1105
01:17:39,875 --> 01:17:41,708
Hey, where's Fajrul?

1106
01:17:41,791 --> 01:17:42,791
Right.

1107
01:17:44,208 --> 01:17:45,958
Where's she? Is she gone?

1108
01:17:52,875 --> 01:17:53,750
Sorry.

1109
01:17:54,041 --> 01:17:55,916
Now we have to get Makmur.

1110
01:17:56,708 --> 01:17:58,750
- Over there?
- Yeah.

1111
01:17:59,583 --> 01:18:00,416
Come on.

1112
01:18:26,541 --> 01:18:28,166
Have mercy, Sari.

1113
01:18:28,708 --> 01:18:30,333
Forgive us, Sari.

1114
01:18:30,875 --> 01:18:32,333
Forgive us.

1115
01:18:34,791 --> 01:18:35,666
Sari, who?

1116
01:18:36,166 --> 01:18:37,250
I'm Wewe Gombel!

1117
01:18:38,125 --> 01:18:38,958
Why?

1118
01:18:39,458 --> 01:18:40,875
I've been here all week,

1119
01:18:41,625 --> 01:18:43,958
but I couldn't scare anyone.

1120
01:18:46,083 --> 01:18:47,666
I beg you!

1121
01:18:47,958 --> 01:18:49,958
Can you please be afraid or startled?

1122
01:18:53,375 --> 01:18:54,291
I'm scared…

1123
01:18:54,375 --> 01:18:55,708
So scary.

1124
01:18:55,791 --> 01:18:56,958
You're faking it.

1125
01:18:59,875 --> 01:19:01,333
Please be afraid!

1126
01:19:03,416 --> 01:19:05,583
You're exaggerating, Solah.

1127
01:19:05,666 --> 01:19:08,000
- I'm trying to get this over with.
- Too dramatic.

1128
01:19:08,416 --> 01:19:09,541
I'm going home.

1129
01:19:09,625 --> 01:19:10,875
She's scarier anyway.

1130
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:13,916
"She"?

1131
01:19:18,833 --> 01:19:21,583
Give me back my husband
or you'll be sorry.

1132
01:19:23,833 --> 01:19:27,333
The black sticky rice!

1133
01:19:27,416 --> 01:19:29,958
- It's in the pouch!
- The black sticky rice!

1134
01:19:30,041 --> 01:19:31,375
The black sticky rice!

1135
01:19:53,416 --> 01:19:54,250
Are we clear?

1136
01:20:04,416 --> 01:20:05,833
Where are you taking me?

1137
01:20:08,583 --> 01:20:09,416
Sari?

1138
01:20:09,916 --> 01:20:10,833
Where's Sari?

1139
01:20:11,583 --> 01:20:12,458
Where is she?

1140
01:20:13,541 --> 01:20:14,458
Where is she?

1141
01:20:15,583 --> 01:20:16,416
Honey!

1142
01:20:18,083 --> 01:20:19,291
Where is she, guys?

1143
01:20:19,375 --> 01:20:21,416
Calm down. We're getting you out of here.

1144
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:24,375
- Are you trying to separate me from Sari?
- Sari is a ghost.

1145
01:20:25,125 --> 01:20:26,000
Yesterday, I…

1146
01:20:29,541 --> 01:20:30,708
It's Sari.

1147
01:20:31,416 --> 01:20:32,333
Honey?

1148
01:20:32,416 --> 01:20:34,208
- Sari! Help…
- Stop!

1149
01:20:36,958 --> 01:20:41,041
Can you quiet down? I'm trying to pee.

1150
01:20:43,125 --> 01:20:45,125
It's a huge forest and you're peeing here?

1151
01:20:45,208 --> 01:20:47,416
It's a huge forest
and you're chatting here?

1152
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:50,375
You can't tell me what to do. Go away!

1153
01:20:50,458 --> 01:20:52,166
- Try me!
- You try me!

1154
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:53,708
- Try me!
- You try me!

1155
01:20:53,791 --> 01:20:54,708
Stop it!

1156
01:20:55,416 --> 01:20:56,458
I'm going home.

1157
01:20:56,875 --> 01:20:57,875
- Hey.
- Mur!

1158
01:20:58,375 --> 01:20:59,250
Mur!

1159
01:20:59,333 --> 01:21:01,750
We're trying to help you.

1160
01:21:01,833 --> 01:21:03,875
He's right. You're living with a ghost.

1161
01:21:03,958 --> 01:21:05,375
Sari is not a ghost.

1162
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:07,416
You're so stubborn.

1163
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:08,333
Makmur.

1164
01:21:09,541 --> 01:21:11,625
I found her skeleton in the bushes.

1165
01:21:11,708 --> 01:21:13,750
How would you know it's her?

1166
01:21:13,833 --> 01:21:16,666
The skeleton had a wedding ring on it.

1167
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:18,875
Some skeletons are dressed in suits.

1168
01:21:18,958 --> 01:21:21,500
Some in wedding dresses
or traditional outfits.

1169
01:21:22,041 --> 01:21:23,166
Give it a rest.

1170
01:21:24,083 --> 01:21:25,750
I know I'm not the smartest,

1171
01:21:26,208 --> 01:21:28,041
but don't make a fool of me.

1172
01:21:29,541 --> 01:21:31,041
I love her.

1173
01:21:33,041 --> 01:21:34,416
No matter what happens,

1174
01:21:35,041 --> 01:21:36,541
I will never leave her.

1175
01:21:37,583 --> 01:21:39,125
If you're gonna keep doing this,

1176
01:21:39,208 --> 01:21:40,958
please stay away from me.

1177
01:21:45,166 --> 01:21:46,708
You said we were brothers.

1178
01:21:48,583 --> 01:21:51,333
What kind of brothers
would split a husband from his wife?

1179
01:21:53,791 --> 01:21:54,916
You guys are cruel.

1180
01:21:55,958 --> 01:21:56,791
Makmur!

1181
01:21:57,166 --> 01:21:58,916
Makmur!

1182
01:21:59,666 --> 01:22:00,500
Makmur!

1183
01:22:08,416 --> 01:22:10,083
He hasn't changed at all.

1184
01:22:10,166 --> 01:22:11,500
Stubborn as ever.

1185
01:22:13,791 --> 01:22:15,375
We have to come up with a plan.

1186
01:22:18,666 --> 01:22:21,291
Jaka, you're the closest person to him.

1187
01:22:21,625 --> 01:22:24,583
In the barracks,
you're the one he slept with the most.

1188
01:22:26,791 --> 01:22:27,625
Solah.

1189
01:22:28,291 --> 01:22:31,500
You're from the village closest to Makmur.

1190
01:22:37,041 --> 01:22:37,958
And you, Supra.

1191
01:22:40,916 --> 01:22:43,375
You've been the group's leader
for the longest time.

1192
01:22:44,833 --> 01:22:47,625
I don't care what it takes,

1193
01:22:48,041 --> 01:22:49,333
we must save Makmur.

1194
01:22:50,708 --> 01:22:51,791
Do you understand?

1195
01:22:55,041 --> 01:22:55,875
Supra.

1196
01:22:58,041 --> 01:23:01,541
Before, during, and after
I recovered from the wasp sting,

1197
01:23:01,625 --> 01:23:03,125
Makmur is still stubborn.

1198
01:23:03,458 --> 01:23:04,500
What do we do?

1199
01:23:04,958 --> 01:23:07,750
Listen up! This is no time
to be messing around.

1200
01:23:11,791 --> 01:23:14,375
No matter how deep our wounds are,

1201
01:23:14,791 --> 01:23:18,875
nothing can separate us as brothers.

1202
01:23:19,250 --> 01:23:21,125
Remember who we are.

1203
01:23:23,583 --> 01:23:25,083
We are true soldiers!

1204
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:26,083
Help!

1205
01:23:26,166 --> 01:23:27,708
- Makmur!
- Makmur!

1206
01:23:34,333 --> 01:23:35,791
You're supposed to say,

1207
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:38,208
"Yessir!"

1208
01:23:42,166 --> 01:23:43,500
Makmur! What's the matter?

1209
01:23:43,583 --> 01:23:44,583
My stomach hurts.

1210
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:46,083
Constipation?

1211
01:23:53,958 --> 01:23:55,125
What's wrong with him?

1212
01:23:56,541 --> 01:23:58,083
His gunshot wound hasn't healed.

1213
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Give this to Makmur.

1214
01:24:09,916 --> 01:24:10,791
Mur.

1215
01:24:14,166 --> 01:24:17,041
- Will that work?
- Yes. It's a remedy from when I was a kid.

1216
01:24:17,125 --> 01:24:21,583
- You got shot when you were a kid?
- No. It's for scabs.

1217
01:24:21,666 --> 01:24:25,458
Once applied,
it heals within five minutes.

1218
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:37,166
If Makmur thinks Sari is still alive,

1219
01:24:37,791 --> 01:24:41,000
whose skeleton did Fajrul find?

1220
01:24:42,666 --> 01:24:46,875
But Fajrul said the skeleton was wearing
the same wedding ring as Sari.

1221
01:24:47,958 --> 01:24:48,958
That's strange.

1222
01:24:49,583 --> 01:24:51,083
I thought when someone dies,

1223
01:24:51,166 --> 01:24:53,958
they wouldn't be wearing rings,
necklaces, or any jewelry.

1224
01:24:54,041 --> 01:24:55,041
Right.

1225
01:24:56,041 --> 01:24:57,958
Kuntilanak don't wear earrings.

1226
01:25:00,041 --> 01:25:02,250
If the skeleton had a wedding ring,

1227
01:25:02,333 --> 01:25:05,750
then Makmur should have
the same ring as Sari.

1228
01:25:08,083 --> 01:25:09,541
Check his fingers.

1229
01:25:15,875 --> 01:25:16,708
Makmur.

1230
01:25:17,875 --> 01:25:20,083
Let me see your right hand for a sec.

1231
01:25:35,666 --> 01:25:36,583
He doesn't have it.

1232
01:25:36,666 --> 01:25:37,708
What?

1233
01:25:39,333 --> 01:25:40,208
That means…

1234
01:25:43,791 --> 01:25:45,708
What? You startled me.

1235
01:25:45,791 --> 01:25:46,916
What are you doing?

1236
01:25:47,458 --> 01:25:48,541
Sari is not the ghost.

1237
01:25:49,041 --> 01:25:50,250
The ghost is Makmur.

1238
01:25:51,375 --> 01:25:52,500
Nonsense.

1239
01:25:53,375 --> 01:25:54,916
Makmur is dead.

1240
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,208
The skeleton you found is Makmur.

1241
01:25:57,291 --> 01:25:58,291
- Right.
- What?

1242
01:26:00,250 --> 01:26:01,791
If you believe me… Jak!

1243
01:26:02,416 --> 01:26:04,125
Throw the black sticky rice at him.

1244
01:26:04,875 --> 01:26:05,750
You're right.

1245
01:26:24,041 --> 01:26:26,041
A ghost!

1246
01:26:42,541 --> 01:26:46,541
I can't believe Makmur is the ghost.

1247
01:26:48,083 --> 01:26:50,333
We've been with a ghost all this time.

1248
01:26:51,583 --> 01:26:53,333
We also accepted him as our brother.

1249
01:26:54,458 --> 01:26:58,333
So Makmur was already
a ghost during the war?

1250
01:26:58,791 --> 01:27:00,708
The body I found was already a skeleton.

1251
01:27:01,125 --> 01:27:02,125
Perhaps.

1252
01:27:02,583 --> 01:27:03,708
I feel sorry for Sari.

1253
01:27:04,166 --> 01:27:07,375
She's… been accused of being a ghost.

1254
01:27:08,375 --> 01:27:09,208
Sari.

1255
01:27:12,291 --> 01:27:13,125
Sari.

1256
01:27:18,083 --> 01:27:20,083
That means Sari is innocent.

1257
01:27:21,583 --> 01:27:23,083
We have to get her out of here.

1258
01:27:23,625 --> 01:27:25,375
And I will protect her

1259
01:27:26,041 --> 01:27:27,541
until death do us part.

1260
01:27:28,083 --> 01:27:29,083
What the heck?

1261
01:27:29,166 --> 01:27:30,125
Are you serious?

1262
01:27:30,208 --> 01:27:32,166
Are you seriously thinking about

1263
01:27:32,583 --> 01:27:35,000
replacing Makmur in this situation?

1264
01:27:37,083 --> 01:27:39,083
It's about humanity.

1265
01:27:39,166 --> 01:27:40,500
Humanity, my foot!

1266
01:27:40,583 --> 01:27:42,375
Sari is a beautiful woman.

1267
01:27:42,458 --> 01:27:44,291
We can't leave her alone.

1268
01:27:44,750 --> 01:27:47,541
She needs a man willing
to take on the responsibility

1269
01:27:48,375 --> 01:27:49,541
of protecting her.

1270
01:27:50,791 --> 01:27:51,875
And that would be…

1271
01:27:55,875 --> 01:27:58,541
Solah Vicenzio.

1272
01:28:00,958 --> 01:28:01,791
Sari.

1273
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:05,041
I'm coming for you.

1274
01:28:05,125 --> 01:28:06,208
Sari!

1275
01:28:06,791 --> 01:28:07,791
Solah, wait.

1276
01:28:08,791 --> 01:28:10,208
You sure she's not the ghost?

1277
01:28:10,791 --> 01:28:14,000
She served us worms and insects
the other day.

1278
01:28:14,083 --> 01:28:15,041
I'm sure.

1279
01:28:15,541 --> 01:28:16,916
I'm sure she's not a ghost.

1280
01:28:17,458 --> 01:28:18,458
You just don't know.

1281
01:28:19,041 --> 01:28:21,083
That kind of food is common in Thailand.

1282
01:28:21,708 --> 01:28:23,166
Worms are a source of protein.

1283
01:28:24,416 --> 01:28:27,333
Besides, Sari's father is from Thailand.

1284
01:28:28,333 --> 01:28:29,166
Really?

1285
01:28:31,416 --> 01:28:33,666
I'm not sure. But he could be.

1286
01:28:37,583 --> 01:28:38,416
Maybe.

1287
01:28:38,916 --> 01:28:39,791
Come on.

1288
01:28:47,166 --> 01:28:51,000
Sari. I've come here with my friends

1289
01:28:51,083 --> 01:28:53,250
to apologize because we accused you

1290
01:28:55,166 --> 01:28:56,666
of being a ghost.

1291
01:28:57,041 --> 01:29:00,750
But it appears we were mistaken.
You're simply a charming woman.

1292
01:29:03,083 --> 01:29:04,875
We must leave, Sari.

1293
01:29:05,541 --> 01:29:07,291
- Where?
- To a new place.

1294
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:09,250
Start a new life

1295
01:29:10,125 --> 01:29:11,250
with a new partner.

1296
01:29:14,041 --> 01:29:15,625
Where's Kang Makmur?

1297
01:29:15,708 --> 01:29:17,333
Makmur is waiting upstream.

1298
01:29:17,416 --> 01:29:20,500
As for us… we're going to the officiant.

1299
01:29:23,166 --> 01:29:24,375
What he's saying is…

1300
01:29:24,708 --> 01:29:27,625
Let's go upstream
because Makmur is waiting there.

1301
01:29:27,708 --> 01:29:29,083
- Really?
- Yes.

1302
01:29:29,166 --> 01:29:30,416
You should get ready

1303
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:31,708
and bring our child.

1304
01:29:31,791 --> 01:29:32,750
Hey!

1305
01:29:34,291 --> 01:29:35,416
I mean, your child.

1306
01:29:36,125 --> 01:29:36,958
Cipluk.

1307
01:29:41,333 --> 01:29:42,625
Where's Makmur?

1308
01:29:44,416 --> 01:29:46,375
He's just up ahead. Right, guys?

1309
01:29:46,458 --> 01:29:48,250
- Yeah.
- Up ahead.

1310
01:29:50,083 --> 01:29:51,250
The boat's leaking.

1311
01:29:52,041 --> 01:29:53,458
I think we're too heavy.

1312
01:29:54,791 --> 01:29:57,041
Here, the bags! Toss out all the bags.

1313
01:29:59,125 --> 01:30:00,250
There's more.

1314
01:30:01,041 --> 01:30:02,833
- What about now?
- It's still leaking.

1315
01:30:02,916 --> 01:30:04,708
Drop everything we're holding.

1316
01:30:09,166 --> 01:30:10,000
That's all of it!

1317
01:30:10,791 --> 01:30:11,625
Good.

1318
01:30:12,458 --> 01:30:13,791
"Good" my foot!

1319
01:30:14,541 --> 01:30:17,000
How can we move? You tossed the paddle.

1320
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:18,458
Jaka!

1321
01:30:18,958 --> 01:30:20,791
Jrul, you go.

1322
01:30:21,125 --> 01:30:22,916
No. I can't swim.

1323
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:23,958
There's Makmur!

1324
01:30:25,416 --> 01:30:29,083
- Where are you taking my wife and kid?
- We're getting them out of here.

1325
01:30:29,166 --> 01:30:32,416
- You can't live with them, Mur!
- Yeah, you died, Makmur!

1326
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:33,416
You're the ghost!

1327
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:35,125
How could he be the ghost?

1328
01:30:36,375 --> 01:30:37,916
Makmur died in the war.

1329
01:30:38,791 --> 01:30:41,208
But he didn't realize it. None of us did.

1330
01:30:41,791 --> 01:30:43,541
His body was already sent back here

1331
01:30:43,625 --> 01:30:46,500
and secretly buried
behind your house, Sari.

1332
01:30:46,583 --> 01:30:47,916
But don't worry, Sari.

1333
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,583
I will protect you.

1334
01:30:49,666 --> 01:30:51,041
Give me back my family!

1335
01:30:54,208 --> 01:30:55,541
Mur! Don't come here!

1336
01:30:55,625 --> 01:30:57,583
- Mur, stop!
- Use your hands!

1337
01:30:58,291 --> 01:30:59,125
Hurry!

1338
01:31:01,541 --> 01:31:02,416
Kang Makmur!

1339
01:31:03,375 --> 01:31:04,208
Kang!

1340
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,208
- Kang Makmur!
- Mur!

1341
01:31:10,375 --> 01:31:11,666
Where is he?

1342
01:31:17,333 --> 01:31:18,416
Help!

1343
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:20,750
- My legs are cramping!
- Come on up.

1344
01:31:22,416 --> 01:31:23,708
Help!

1345
01:31:33,916 --> 01:31:36,125
Why did you run away from me?

1346
01:31:36,208 --> 01:31:38,208
We all thought you were the ghost.

1347
01:31:39,666 --> 01:31:41,625
None of us thought that.

1348
01:31:42,583 --> 01:31:44,708
But Jaka did.

1349
01:31:44,791 --> 01:31:47,416
He screamed
when I threw the sticky rice at him.

1350
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:50,625
The sticky rice went into my wound,
it really hurt.

1351
01:31:50,708 --> 01:31:52,125
What about your wedding ring?

1352
01:31:53,916 --> 01:31:55,208
- Here's my ring.
- He has it.

1353
01:31:55,291 --> 01:31:57,541
I made it into a necklace
before I left for war.

1354
01:31:57,625 --> 01:32:00,166
Can we stop talking about ghosts?
Focus on the boat.

1355
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:01,791
The boat's almost full of water.

1356
01:32:02,416 --> 01:32:04,833
Come on, paddle with your hands.

1357
01:32:06,750 --> 01:32:07,625
Careful.

1358
01:32:09,875 --> 01:32:11,583
- Hold on!
- What?

1359
01:32:11,666 --> 01:32:15,250
First we assumed Sari was the ghost,
then it turned out to be Makmur.

1360
01:32:15,333 --> 01:32:18,208
Now that Makmur is not the ghost,
who's the real ghost?

1361
01:32:18,291 --> 01:32:20,791
We'll turn into ghosts if this boat sinks.

1362
01:32:21,083 --> 01:32:22,458
Makmur's here too.

1363
01:32:22,541 --> 01:32:23,875
It's getting heavier.

1364
01:32:24,541 --> 01:32:26,541
Let's get the boat to shore first.

1365
01:32:27,458 --> 01:32:31,000
How? Using our hands to paddle
isn't working.

1366
01:32:31,083 --> 01:32:32,208
Use this.

1367
01:32:33,791 --> 01:32:34,625
Thanks, Sari.

1368
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,500
What now, Jak?

1369
01:32:41,583 --> 01:32:43,166
What are you waiting for?

1370
01:32:52,750 --> 01:32:54,500
Supra! Move aside.

1371
01:32:54,583 --> 01:32:55,416
Where?

1372
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:56,750
Doesn't matter.

1373
01:32:56,833 --> 01:32:57,875
Yup, like that.

1374
01:32:57,958 --> 01:32:59,625
- You next, Mur.
- What you doing?

1375
01:32:59,708 --> 01:33:01,375
Just listen to me this once.

1376
01:33:01,458 --> 01:33:03,500
Fajrul, you go left.

1377
01:33:03,583 --> 01:33:06,208
- I prefer to lean right.
- That way is fine too.

1378
01:33:06,291 --> 01:33:08,625
Fajrul, you move aside too.

1379
01:33:08,708 --> 01:33:11,583
Supra! Who told you to sit straight?

1380
01:33:11,666 --> 01:33:13,041
My back hurts, Jaka.

1381
01:33:13,125 --> 01:33:14,791
Just bear with it for a sec.

1382
01:33:15,625 --> 01:33:17,000
Solah, you move!

1383
01:33:17,083 --> 01:33:18,916
- Where?
- Anywhere!

1384
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:22,375
- Just do it, Solah.
- Just lean sideways.

1385
01:33:22,458 --> 01:33:23,833
Don't make this harder.

1386
01:33:23,916 --> 01:33:26,375
Supra lean left, Makmur lean right.

1387
01:33:27,708 --> 01:33:28,666
I'll go left?

1388
01:33:28,750 --> 01:33:29,833
- Okay.
- I'm going left.

1389
01:33:29,916 --> 01:33:31,833
Hold on. What are we doing?

1390
01:33:31,916 --> 01:33:33,416
Just do it, Solah.

1391
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:34,791
True soldiers!

1392
01:33:34,875 --> 01:33:36,750
Yessir!

1393
01:33:36,833 --> 01:33:41,125
<i>Good morning, noon, and night</i>
<i>We are true soldiers</i>

1394
01:33:41,208 --> 01:33:47,000
<i>Soldiers of this land</i>
<i>Fighting for our country</i>

1395
01:33:49,291 --> 01:33:51,083
<i>This is our spirit</i>

1396
01:33:53,416 --> 01:33:58,791
<i>Forever brothers, in life and death</i>

1397
01:34:01,333 --> 01:34:03,000
Sari is the ghost!

1398
01:34:03,416 --> 01:34:04,375
She's the ghost!

1399
01:34:04,791 --> 01:34:05,791
I saw it!

1400
01:34:07,458 --> 01:34:09,000
Can't ghosts wear rings?

1401
01:34:10,708 --> 01:34:12,750
Ghost!

1402
01:34:12,833 --> 01:34:13,708
Ghost!

1403
01:34:13,791 --> 01:34:15,208
She's a ghost!

1404
01:34:15,916 --> 01:34:16,750
Sari?

1405
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:18,083
Kang Mak.

1406
01:34:18,625 --> 01:34:20,083
Jump! All of you!

1407
01:34:20,166 --> 01:34:21,291
Jump off!

1408
01:34:22,708 --> 01:34:24,833
Let's go, Mur!

1409
01:34:26,958 --> 01:34:28,750
- Let's get out of here!
- Sari!

1410
01:34:30,125 --> 01:34:31,041
Sari!

1411
01:34:37,125 --> 01:34:37,958
Wait.

1412
01:34:38,625 --> 01:34:39,708
We're missing one.

1413
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:41,458
Where's Fajrul?

1414
01:34:41,625 --> 01:34:42,541
Sari!

1415
01:34:43,166 --> 01:34:44,500
Fajrul, jump!

1416
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:45,833
Rul, hurry up!

1417
01:34:49,416 --> 01:34:50,250
How?

1418
01:34:50,833 --> 01:34:51,958
I can't swim!

1419
01:34:55,208 --> 01:34:56,041
Sari.

1420
01:34:56,916 --> 01:34:58,625
Let's just have a chat.

1421
01:34:59,958 --> 01:35:01,208
Peace be upon you.

1422
01:35:03,333 --> 01:35:04,375
Not gonna answer?

1423
01:35:04,916 --> 01:35:07,708
You look pale. Are you anemic?

1424
01:35:08,375 --> 01:35:10,000
You should eat more fruits.

1425
01:35:11,833 --> 01:35:13,458
They increase blood levels.

1426
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:15,333
You don't like fruits?

1427
01:35:15,750 --> 01:35:18,458
I don't think you want to talk to me.

1428
01:35:20,041 --> 01:35:20,875
Help.

1429
01:35:22,791 --> 01:35:25,791
I think you're not in the mood to talk.

1430
01:35:33,458 --> 01:35:34,958
He's so fast!

1431
01:35:40,583 --> 01:35:42,416
You said you couldn't swim.

1432
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:44,000
You swam like a champion.

1433
01:35:44,791 --> 01:35:45,833
Honey.

1434
01:35:45,916 --> 01:35:46,791
Sari!

1435
01:35:48,666 --> 01:35:49,750
We have to go now.

1436
01:35:49,833 --> 01:35:50,916
No, I can't.

1437
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,416
I promised her,

1438
01:35:52,791 --> 01:35:54,500
I would never leave her.

1439
01:35:57,791 --> 01:35:59,000
What was that for?

1440
01:36:02,333 --> 01:36:03,416
It wasn't me. Him.

1441
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:04,500
Right.

1442
01:36:04,583 --> 01:36:05,791
What was that for?

1443
01:36:15,333 --> 01:36:16,166
Sari…

1444
01:36:17,375 --> 01:36:18,875
I will never leave you.

1445
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:25,458
He knocks himself out a lot, huh?

1446
01:36:27,541 --> 01:36:29,208
Sari's angry!

1447
01:36:30,916 --> 01:36:31,916
Come on! Hurry!

1448
01:36:39,666 --> 01:36:40,833
Where are we going?

1449
01:36:40,916 --> 01:36:42,500
Let's go to Mbak Yu Supi's place.

1450
01:36:44,916 --> 01:36:45,750
Let's go.

1451
01:36:46,250 --> 01:36:47,166
Wait!

1452
01:36:47,250 --> 01:36:49,083
Wait. Isn't that Mbak Yu Supi?

1453
01:36:50,125 --> 01:36:52,500
She's dead. Sari must've killed her.

1454
01:36:52,583 --> 01:36:53,875
- Help her out.
- Wait.

1455
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:55,958
Makmur might wake up soon.

1456
01:36:56,333 --> 01:36:58,125
What if people think we killed her?

1457
01:36:59,375 --> 01:37:00,458
Where do we go?

1458
01:37:01,791 --> 01:37:02,833
I know a place.

1459
01:37:03,791 --> 01:37:05,000
- Come with me.
- Okay.

1460
01:37:13,583 --> 01:37:14,750
Of course…

1461
01:37:15,750 --> 01:37:18,041
I will not just stand still

1462
01:37:19,125 --> 01:37:22,000
after my twin sister was murdered.

1463
01:37:23,458 --> 01:37:25,416
I will help you

1464
01:37:26,041 --> 01:37:28,875
fight that ghost.

1465
01:37:29,333 --> 01:37:30,458
How, Kang Mas?

1466
01:37:30,708 --> 01:37:34,833
I will try to summon the spirit of my twin

1467
01:37:34,916 --> 01:37:36,916
to enter my body.

1468
01:37:48,583 --> 01:37:50,458
Rames rice…

1469
01:38:00,125 --> 01:38:04,125
There are four ways to defeat this ghost.

1470
01:38:04,541 --> 01:38:05,541
Number one.

1471
01:38:06,791 --> 01:38:09,000
Prepare black sticky rice.

1472
01:38:16,250 --> 01:38:17,125
Number two.

1473
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,208
A garden of flowers.

1474
01:38:19,291 --> 01:38:20,666
A carton flower?

1475
01:38:22,208 --> 01:38:23,166
A garden of flowers.

1476
01:38:34,708 --> 01:38:35,875
Number three.

1477
01:38:35,958 --> 01:38:40,708
I've imbued this wooden sword with spells

1478
01:38:40,791 --> 01:38:44,875
to send that ghost
to the afterlife forever.

1479
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,041
Don't let this sword fall into the hands

1480
01:38:49,125 --> 01:38:51,208
of irresponsible people.

1481
01:38:51,291 --> 01:38:52,333
Yes, Kang Mas.

1482
01:38:52,416 --> 01:38:53,750
It could be dangerous.

1483
01:38:54,083 --> 01:38:55,333
Exploited.

1484
01:38:57,958 --> 01:38:58,958
Give it here!

1485
01:39:00,666 --> 01:39:02,333
Lastly.

1486
01:39:04,541 --> 01:39:05,666
This rope…

1487
01:39:06,666 --> 01:39:10,708
has been coated with Cemani chicken blood.

1488
01:39:10,791 --> 01:39:17,000
This acts as a guard
and a barrier between you.

1489
01:39:17,291 --> 01:39:19,458
Thus, I call this

1490
01:39:20,208 --> 01:39:22,041
the bond of kinship.

1491
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:25,333
Hold on.

1492
01:39:25,958 --> 01:39:29,625
You've given tasks to the three of us,
but what about Supra?

1493
01:39:33,166 --> 01:39:34,000
Just curious.

1494
01:39:37,958 --> 01:39:40,083
Don't let the baldie slip away.

1495
01:39:41,291 --> 01:39:42,458
Mister Supra.

1496
01:39:42,541 --> 01:39:44,625
You should stay with me.

1497
01:39:45,541 --> 01:39:46,375
Go for it.

1498
01:39:53,625 --> 01:39:57,166
Make sure no one
steps outside this barrier.

1499
01:39:58,416 --> 01:40:03,750
As long as we're inside here,
the ghost won't come near.

1500
01:40:05,375 --> 01:40:07,208
You're the best, Kang Mas Pusi.

1501
01:40:14,833 --> 01:40:15,666
She left.

1502
01:40:16,291 --> 01:40:17,291
What did you say?

1503
01:40:17,375 --> 01:40:18,750
I said you're the best.

1504
01:40:18,833 --> 01:40:20,166
Don't say that.

1505
01:40:20,791 --> 01:40:21,791
Supi is sulking.

1506
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:24,000
We had no idea, Kang Mas.

1507
01:40:24,083 --> 01:40:24,916
Yeah.

1508
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:28,625
Give it another try before Sari shows up.

1509
01:40:28,708 --> 01:40:32,125
Okay. I don't think
I'm strong enough by myself.

1510
01:40:32,916 --> 01:40:34,041
What about us?

1511
01:41:02,291 --> 01:41:03,125
Delivery!

1512
01:41:05,166 --> 01:41:06,000
Delivery?

1513
01:41:08,458 --> 01:41:09,458
Leave it outside.

1514
01:41:12,791 --> 01:41:13,750
Let's try again.

1515
01:41:30,833 --> 01:41:32,791
Padang rice…

1516
01:41:37,666 --> 01:41:39,125
What else did you order?

1517
01:41:39,791 --> 01:41:40,791
Nothing.

1518
01:41:53,250 --> 01:41:56,916
Don't take a single step back.

1519
01:41:57,416 --> 01:41:58,875
Don't step back!

1520
01:41:58,958 --> 01:42:00,583
- Step forward!
- Don't step back.

1521
01:42:00,708 --> 01:42:02,750
- You're moving back!
- I'm getting my stance ready.

1522
01:42:02,833 --> 01:42:04,000
Stop pushing me.

1523
01:42:04,750 --> 01:42:06,041
Don't step back!

1524
01:42:07,333 --> 01:42:08,458
You're moving back!

1525
01:42:09,875 --> 01:42:11,416
Don't be afraid. Stand up.

1526
01:42:13,416 --> 01:42:14,625
Arm yourselves.

1527
01:42:16,416 --> 01:42:17,416
Chicken porridge!

1528
01:42:18,666 --> 01:42:19,666
Chicken porridge!

1529
01:42:19,750 --> 01:42:21,125
- No porridge.
- That one.

1530
01:42:21,541 --> 01:42:23,166
- Sticky black rice.
- Yes, that one.

1531
01:42:25,416 --> 01:42:26,250
Here.

1532
01:42:26,666 --> 01:42:27,708
You do it.

1533
01:42:28,333 --> 01:42:29,166
Not me.

1534
01:42:35,625 --> 01:42:36,625
Did I get her?

1535
01:42:36,708 --> 01:42:37,666
We did it!

1536
01:42:39,708 --> 01:42:40,875
That's amazing.

1537
01:42:40,958 --> 01:42:42,541
- Honey?
- Kang Makmur!

1538
01:42:42,625 --> 01:42:43,666
Sari?

1539
01:42:43,750 --> 01:42:45,166
- Kang Makmur.
- Sari!

1540
01:42:45,250 --> 01:42:46,875
- Makmur, stop!
- Sari!

1541
01:42:46,958 --> 01:42:47,833
Sari!

1542
01:42:47,916 --> 01:42:50,250
Second weapon! The garden of flowers!

1543
01:42:50,333 --> 01:42:52,000
- You have it!
- Stop!

1544
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,291
Sari! Stop! You're hurting her!

1545
01:42:58,750 --> 01:42:59,750
Don't hurt her!

1546
01:43:00,250 --> 01:43:01,458
Mak! Get a grip!

1547
01:43:01,541 --> 01:43:03,375
That's a ghost! An evil spirit!

1548
01:43:03,458 --> 01:43:07,708
A demon! Cursed! She belongs in hell!
She has no good values!

1549
01:43:07,791 --> 01:43:09,208
- Open your eyes!
- Enough.

1550
01:43:09,291 --> 01:43:12,000
- That's too much.
- But she killed Mbak Yu Supi!

1551
01:43:12,666 --> 01:43:14,250
You demon! Devil!

1552
01:43:14,333 --> 01:43:16,333
You belong in hell! You wretch!

1553
01:43:16,416 --> 01:43:18,041
- Pharaoh's crony.
- Pharaoh's crony!

1554
01:43:18,125 --> 01:43:19,583
- Pale skinned.
- Pale skinned!

1555
01:43:19,666 --> 01:43:21,541
- Banished in hell…
- Go say it yourself.

1556
01:43:21,625 --> 01:43:22,833
No! I'm too scared.

1557
01:43:22,916 --> 01:43:25,250
I never killed anyone.

1558
01:43:25,333 --> 01:43:26,958
Liar! We don't believe you!

1559
01:43:27,041 --> 01:43:29,791
As I said, I didn't kill anyone!

1560
01:43:29,875 --> 01:43:31,708
Sari! Let me go!

1561
01:43:31,791 --> 01:43:33,125
The sword!

1562
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,916
You do it. I'm just here to cast spells.

1563
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:36,833
Go!

1564
01:43:38,375 --> 01:43:40,000
No! Sari!

1565
01:43:41,208 --> 01:43:42,458
Hurry up!

1566
01:43:47,708 --> 01:43:48,708
Makmur!

1567
01:43:52,291 --> 01:43:53,625
Makmur, stop!

1568
01:43:53,708 --> 01:43:54,958
Hold him!

1569
01:43:55,041 --> 01:43:56,791
- Sari!
- What's next?

1570
01:43:57,375 --> 01:43:58,750
Only one way left.

1571
01:44:00,166 --> 01:44:02,125
This is a forbidden technique.

1572
01:44:03,375 --> 01:44:05,875
Don't! Sari!

1573
01:44:05,958 --> 01:44:08,375
- Mak, calm down! Makmur!
- Sari! Run!

1574
01:44:08,458 --> 01:44:09,958
Don't sacrifice yourself.

1575
01:44:10,041 --> 01:44:11,958
- Don't hurt Sari!
- Kang Mas Pusi!

1576
01:44:12,041 --> 01:44:13,041
Enough!

1577
01:44:13,708 --> 01:44:16,208
- Calm down.
- Let him handle it as best he can.

1578
01:44:16,750 --> 01:44:18,875
Sari. Listen to me.

1579
01:44:19,208 --> 01:44:20,416
Do you have any idea

1580
01:44:21,791 --> 01:44:25,833
what the most dangerous
occupation in the world is?

1581
01:44:27,041 --> 01:44:29,000
A shaman. Why?

1582
01:44:29,083 --> 01:44:31,458
They fight ghosts. Take me, for example.

1583
01:44:31,541 --> 01:44:33,708
I don't want to be hostile towards ghosts

1584
01:44:33,791 --> 01:44:34,791
or be mean to them.

1585
01:44:34,875 --> 01:44:38,250
- What's the point of yelling, threatening?
- What is he talking about?

1586
01:44:38,333 --> 01:44:41,291
I just want to have a chat,

1587
01:44:41,375 --> 01:44:44,000
heart-to-heart, peaceful.

1588
01:44:44,416 --> 01:44:45,458
What do you say, Sar?

1589
01:44:46,791 --> 01:44:49,041
Could we perhaps

1590
01:44:49,333 --> 01:44:52,000
have a chat over some delicious coffee?

1591
01:44:55,458 --> 01:44:57,333
I guess that's a no? It's okay.

1592
01:44:58,125 --> 01:44:59,541
Perhaps you're busy.

1593
01:45:01,916 --> 01:45:02,791
Excuse me.

1594
01:45:08,416 --> 01:45:09,250
I'm heading out.

1595
01:45:09,333 --> 01:45:10,750
What about us?

1596
01:45:12,083 --> 01:45:13,916
This is your domestic affair,

1597
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,083
you sort it out.

1598
01:45:15,166 --> 01:45:18,166
I'm an outsider,
it's not my place to intervene.

1599
01:45:18,250 --> 01:45:19,250
Okay?

1600
01:45:28,250 --> 01:45:29,666
Makmur, no!

1601
01:45:29,750 --> 01:45:30,708
Sari, run away!

1602
01:45:30,791 --> 01:45:31,833
Stop!

1603
01:45:36,958 --> 01:45:38,500
My package is outside.

1604
01:45:42,250 --> 01:45:44,041
Excuse me. Just grabbing my package.

1605
01:45:49,291 --> 01:45:50,625
Makmur!

1606
01:45:50,708 --> 01:45:52,750
Run, Sari! Save yourself!

1607
01:46:09,208 --> 01:46:11,083
Why are we tied up?

1608
01:46:11,166 --> 01:46:14,166
Now it's your turn to feel pain.

1609
01:46:14,250 --> 01:46:16,625
Sari. Please don't hurt me.

1610
01:46:16,708 --> 01:46:20,708
You should've stayed out of my life
with Kang Makmur.

1611
01:46:20,791 --> 01:46:21,958
Sar! Get a grip!

1612
01:46:22,666 --> 01:46:24,958
- You don't belong here!
- I don't care!

1613
01:46:25,041 --> 01:46:26,291
She doesn't care?

1614
01:46:26,375 --> 01:46:29,791
I just want to be together again
with the person I love.

1615
01:46:29,875 --> 01:46:32,375
That's not love. That's toxic.

1616
01:46:32,958 --> 01:46:33,958
Sari.

1617
01:46:34,041 --> 01:46:36,958
Think about Makmur's life.

1618
01:46:37,416 --> 01:46:40,875
If Makmur stays with you,
the villagers will shun him.

1619
01:46:41,333 --> 01:46:42,166
Shut up!

1620
01:46:42,875 --> 01:46:44,708
You've made me even angrier.

1621
01:46:45,500 --> 01:46:46,708
We're sorry, Sari.

1622
01:46:46,791 --> 01:46:50,583
There's no need to be offended.
That's just the way they talk.

1623
01:46:50,666 --> 01:46:51,500
It's too late.

1624
01:46:51,583 --> 01:46:54,750
Now I'll make you go through
the pain I felt.

1625
01:46:54,833 --> 01:46:58,750
I will finish you off one by one,

1626
01:46:58,833 --> 01:47:02,166
until no one remains
to interfere with our lives.

1627
01:47:03,333 --> 01:47:04,208
No!

1628
01:47:06,125 --> 01:47:06,958
Honey.

1629
01:47:18,875 --> 01:47:19,750
Honey.

1630
01:47:20,083 --> 01:47:21,791
Honey, stop it.

1631
01:47:22,625 --> 01:47:23,666
Don't do it.

1632
01:47:24,291 --> 01:47:25,958
Please, don't do this.

1633
01:47:26,041 --> 01:47:29,458
They didn't mean any harm to you.

1634
01:47:31,541 --> 01:47:33,208
They just wanted to help me.

1635
01:47:34,083 --> 01:47:35,416
Because we promised

1636
01:47:36,083 --> 01:47:39,708
to fight together as brothers
in life and in death.

1637
01:47:40,291 --> 01:47:42,666
But as long as they're here,

1638
01:47:43,333 --> 01:47:45,416
they will interfere with our lives.

1639
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:49,125
But if you hurt them,
especially if you kill them,

1640
01:47:49,666 --> 01:47:51,583
then it only proves them right.

1641
01:47:52,041 --> 01:47:53,166
You're evil.

1642
01:48:12,875 --> 01:48:13,708
Honey.

1643
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,541
To live in the same world…

1644
01:48:21,250 --> 01:48:23,833
so that nobody bothers us,

1645
01:48:26,833 --> 01:48:27,875
including them,

1646
01:48:30,666 --> 01:48:31,791
it would be better…

1647
01:48:35,958 --> 01:48:37,458
for you to take me.

1648
01:48:38,083 --> 01:48:39,541
Do you mean it?

1649
01:48:41,875 --> 01:48:42,791
Yes.

1650
01:48:57,125 --> 01:48:58,000
Makmur!

1651
01:48:59,750 --> 01:49:00,708
Sari, no!

1652
01:49:02,791 --> 01:49:03,625
Sari!

1653
01:49:25,416 --> 01:49:26,416
You know…

1654
01:49:28,166 --> 01:49:31,000
I couldn't possibly hurt you,

1655
01:49:32,916 --> 01:49:34,791
much less kill you.

1656
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:39,791
You promised me.

1657
01:49:42,083 --> 01:49:43,916
To be together in life and in death.

1658
01:49:47,041 --> 01:49:49,125
I've always kept that promise.

1659
01:49:53,458 --> 01:49:54,541
I always remember.

1660
01:49:58,250 --> 01:50:02,000
That's why I've stayed with you
from the start.

1661
01:50:04,958 --> 01:50:06,375
Even though I knew that…

1662
01:50:08,833 --> 01:50:09,708
You…

1663
01:50:29,333 --> 01:50:30,750
You were gone.

1664
01:50:34,625 --> 01:50:36,416
You knew from the start?

1665
01:50:43,583 --> 01:50:45,458
Did they say anything about me?

1666
01:51:56,625 --> 01:51:58,500
I'm so sorry.

1667
01:51:58,583 --> 01:51:59,916
I came home too late.

1668
01:52:02,375 --> 01:52:03,708
I was too late.

1669
01:52:04,625 --> 01:52:07,125
<i>Even if all the villagers shun me,</i>

1670
01:52:12,083 --> 01:52:14,041
and nobody wants to be my friend.

1671
01:52:17,541 --> 01:52:20,583
Even if they think I'm crazy.

1672
01:52:21,125 --> 01:52:23,166
I will stay with you.

1673
01:52:23,916 --> 01:52:25,750
I'm not going anywhere.

1674
01:52:26,666 --> 01:52:28,041
I will never leave you.

1675
01:52:33,125 --> 01:52:34,416
And even if I have to

1676
01:52:37,416 --> 01:52:39,083
eat dried leaves every day

1677
01:52:42,708 --> 01:52:44,708
<i>with centipedes and maggots,</i>

1678
01:52:46,333 --> 01:52:47,791
<i>I'm really happy.</i>

1679
01:52:51,375 --> 01:52:53,125
<i>I'm genuinely happy.</i>

1680
01:52:56,708 --> 01:52:59,083
Because I get to be together with you.

1681
01:53:03,833 --> 01:53:06,375
Did I make things hard for you?

1682
01:53:08,291 --> 01:53:09,125
No.

1683
01:53:17,625 --> 01:53:19,750
When have you ever given me a hard time?

1684
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,041
You're my everything.

1685
01:53:30,541 --> 01:53:31,958
What's wrong? Too spicy?

1686
01:53:34,500 --> 01:53:36,208
It is. But it's good.

1687
01:53:36,791 --> 01:53:37,666
Delicious.

1688
01:53:37,750 --> 01:53:39,416
<i>If God wills,</i>

1689
01:53:39,791 --> 01:53:42,541
we must stay together.

1690
01:53:42,625 --> 01:53:44,291
In life and in death.

1691
01:53:46,833 --> 01:53:49,500
With Makmur comes Sari.

1692
01:53:50,875 --> 01:53:52,958
Where there's Sari, there's Makmur.

1693
01:53:54,958 --> 01:53:55,791
Promise?

1694
01:53:56,916 --> 01:53:57,791
I promise.

1695
01:54:02,791 --> 01:54:04,583
<i>I'll be home before Cipluk is born.</i>

1696
01:54:22,083 --> 01:54:23,083
I'm off.

1697
01:54:34,250 --> 01:54:35,125
<i>Dear God.</i>

1698
01:54:35,500 --> 01:54:37,708
Please let me see my wife and child.

1699
01:54:38,833 --> 01:54:41,375
I'm not ready to die today.

1700
01:54:41,833 --> 01:54:45,041
Please let my husband
see his wife and child.

1701
01:54:46,208 --> 01:54:47,916
Kang Mak.

1702
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:52,958
<i>Your prayers saved me on the battlefield.</i>

1703
01:54:54,500 --> 01:54:56,375
That's why I'm here today.

1704
01:55:04,125 --> 01:55:05,125
Thanks to you,

1705
01:55:06,250 --> 01:55:08,666
I'm no longer afraid
to enter a haunted house.

1706
01:55:09,666 --> 01:55:11,541
But I'm a ghost.

1707
01:55:14,708 --> 01:55:18,208
Aren't you scared of ghosts?

1708
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:20,041
I am.

1709
01:55:21,916 --> 01:55:25,500
But I'm more scared of living without you.

1710
01:55:35,541 --> 01:55:39,875
I love you, Sari.

1711
01:55:42,541 --> 01:55:43,541
Forever.

1712
01:55:45,791 --> 01:55:47,375
I love you too.

1713
01:55:47,458 --> 01:55:49,583
I love you.

1714
01:56:15,666 --> 01:56:16,916
Will you let them go?

1715
01:56:21,791 --> 01:56:22,666
Please.

1716
01:56:31,041 --> 01:56:32,416
Is this weird?

1717
01:56:33,750 --> 01:56:35,208
Seeing my arms do this?

1718
01:56:38,583 --> 01:56:39,791
A little bit.

1719
01:56:42,875 --> 01:56:44,708
But I'll get used to it.

1720
01:56:46,208 --> 01:56:47,916
In fact…

1721
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,250
I think it's sexy.

1722
01:56:52,833 --> 01:56:54,291
Kang Mak.

1723
01:56:54,375 --> 01:56:55,541
Neng Sari.

1724
01:56:55,625 --> 01:56:56,708
Kang Mak.

1725
01:56:56,791 --> 01:56:57,791
Sari.

1726
01:56:58,500 --> 01:56:59,541
Kang Makmur.

1727
01:57:00,125 --> 01:57:01,208
Sari.

1728
01:57:02,125 --> 01:57:03,333
Fajrul.

1729
01:57:03,416 --> 01:57:04,500
Kang Mak!

1730
01:57:04,583 --> 01:57:05,416
Jaka.

1731
01:57:05,916 --> 01:57:07,083
Supra.

1732
01:57:07,875 --> 01:57:09,041
Solah.

1733
01:57:09,583 --> 01:57:11,666
How long should
we keep calling each other?

1734
01:57:12,875 --> 01:57:15,875
Your friends can handle
being tied up till morning.

1735
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:19,708
Yeah. We may look like bacang,
but we're strong enough.

1736
01:57:20,416 --> 01:57:21,666
It's fine.

1737
01:57:22,166 --> 01:57:24,041
Enjoy being lovey-dovey over there.

1738
01:57:24,125 --> 01:57:25,916
We enjoy being tied up here.

1739
01:57:36,375 --> 01:57:37,375
Thank you, honey.

1740
01:57:41,041 --> 01:57:42,458
- Mur.
- Mur.

1741
01:57:54,416 --> 01:57:55,250
Sorry, Mur.

1742
01:58:13,958 --> 01:58:15,583
Who's holding you?

1743
01:58:15,666 --> 01:58:17,041
Is it Uncle Doyok?

1744
01:58:17,125 --> 01:58:18,833
It's Uncle Fajrul.

1745
01:58:18,916 --> 01:58:20,958
The handsome Uncle Fajrul.

1746
01:58:21,750 --> 01:58:24,083
Apparently, ghosts aren't that scary.

1747
01:58:24,166 --> 01:58:27,000
After all, it's Sari and Cipluk.

1748
01:58:27,083 --> 01:58:28,958
Introduce us to your friends.

1749
01:58:29,041 --> 01:58:30,500
I might see someone I like.

1750
01:58:30,583 --> 01:58:32,291
I'd like one too.

1751
01:58:33,041 --> 01:58:35,791
- You want one?
- Do you want to see them?

1752
01:58:35,875 --> 01:58:36,958
- Yeah!
- Sure.

1753
01:58:37,625 --> 01:58:39,333
- You have friends?
- Of course.

1754
01:58:40,416 --> 01:58:41,250
There.

1755
01:58:46,250 --> 01:58:48,000
Baldie.

1756
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,625
Mbak Yu Supi!

1757
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,041
- Baldie.
- Get her!

1758
01:58:54,125 --> 01:58:56,250
Give it a shot, Supra. You might like her.

1759
01:58:56,333 --> 01:58:57,166
Go for it.

1760
01:58:58,208 --> 01:58:59,333
Enjoy it.

1761
01:58:59,416 --> 01:59:00,750
Mbak Yu Supi.

1762
01:59:01,458 --> 01:59:02,875
How did you die?

1763
01:59:02,958 --> 01:59:05,125
I drowned.

1764
01:59:05,208 --> 01:59:06,375
You couldn't swim?

1765
01:59:06,708 --> 01:59:07,958
I can.

1766
01:59:08,625 --> 01:59:11,375
But I was drunk.

1767
01:59:12,791 --> 01:59:14,041
She was drunk.

1768
01:59:14,125 --> 01:59:17,625
- No wonder her mouth reeks of garbage.
- Baldie.

1769
01:59:18,583 --> 01:59:20,625
Baldie!

1770
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:22,041
Help!

1771
01:59:22,375 --> 01:59:24,125
My hair will fall out! No!

1772
01:59:37,250 --> 01:59:39,916
{\an8}Slowly, be careful not to fall.
It's slippery.

1773
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:41,000
{\an8}50 YEARS LATER

1774
01:59:41,083 --> 01:59:42,791
{\an8}- Mr. San?
- Mr. Mamat?

1775
01:59:43,041 --> 01:59:44,125
Mr. San!

1776
01:59:44,208 --> 01:59:46,333
How are you?

1777
01:59:46,666 --> 01:59:48,583
I missed you!

1778
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:52,458
Did you bring tourists from Thailand here?

1779
01:59:52,541 --> 01:59:54,625
They came all the way from Thailand

1780
01:59:54,708 --> 01:59:56,958
to see this museum.

1781
01:59:59,041 --> 02:00:00,291
Come on in.

1782
02:00:00,375 --> 02:00:01,708
Right now?

1783
02:00:01,791 --> 02:00:03,208
Okay, come in everyone!

1784
02:00:03,291 --> 02:00:04,958
- Let's take pictures!
- Hello.

1785
02:00:05,041 --> 02:00:08,458
{\an8}My honored guests. Ladies and gentlemen.

1786
02:00:08,541 --> 02:00:10,625
This is the legendary

1787
02:00:10,708 --> 02:00:12,416
Kang Mak and Sari's house.

1788
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,375
This portrait tells the story

1789
02:00:15,458 --> 02:00:17,458
of Makmur and Sari.

1790
02:00:17,875 --> 02:00:19,916
They were a couple

1791
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:21,916
separated by worlds.

1792
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
But by overcoming their struggles,

1793
02:00:24,083 --> 02:00:26,458
their story becomes an inspiration

1794
02:00:26,541 --> 02:00:28,375
for all those in love.

1795
02:00:29,666 --> 02:00:31,000
For all those in love.

1796
02:00:31,083 --> 02:00:32,958
May our love be

1797
02:00:33,041 --> 02:00:35,083
strong and timeless.

1798
02:00:35,958 --> 02:00:37,708
Just like how Makmur and Sari were.

1799
02:00:37,791 --> 02:00:40,083
You may take pictures.

1800
02:00:40,541 --> 02:00:43,333
Okay. Everyone, smile!

1801
02:00:43,416 --> 02:00:45,958
One, two, three.

1802
02:00:47,083 --> 02:00:48,708
That was so cute! Okay.

1803
02:00:57,083 --> 02:00:58,666
Let's take another one.

1804
02:01:00,541 --> 02:01:03,083
One, two, three.

1805
02:01:03,750 --> 02:01:04,583
Okay.

1806
02:01:10,958 --> 02:01:16,125
HERITAGE MUSEUM
HOUSE OF MAKMUR SARI

1807
02:01:21,625 --> 02:01:23,958
Yessir!

3
00:04:30,966 --> 00:04:33,142
<i>Thank you
for riding with us.</i>

4
00:05:48,086 --> 00:05:49,349
Paul, open this door.

5
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,089
I know what you're
doing in there!

6
00:05:52,221 --> 00:05:53,353
Paul!

7
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,139
Why are you doing this?

8
00:05:58,053 --> 00:06:00,055
Paul, come out here
and talk to me.

9
00:06:01,056 --> 00:06:02,623
You're shit!

10
00:06:02,623 --> 00:06:03,928
So I don't know
anything about wine,

11
00:06:03,928 --> 00:06:08,585
but the guy at the store
said this was very good.

12
00:06:09,673 --> 00:06:10,848
You asked?

13
00:06:10,848 --> 00:06:13,503
I did. I didn't
know what to get.

14
00:06:16,506 --> 00:06:19,640
Cheers.

15
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,728
To us.

16
00:06:20,728 --> 00:06:23,121
Ooh, wine store guy nailed it.

17
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:24,384
Yeah?

18
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,255
Is that good? I like it.

19
00:06:28,866 --> 00:06:30,955
I love you.

20
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:35,917
You make me feel
really safe [echoes].

21
00:06:38,702 --> 00:06:41,226
I would never do
anything to hurt you.

22
00:06:43,098 --> 00:06:44,099
I know.

23
00:06:46,754 --> 00:06:48,756
I think Danny's
warming up to you, too.

24
00:06:48,756 --> 00:06:50,714
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

25
00:06:50,714 --> 00:06:53,717
But it'll be even better
now you guys are here.

26
00:06:53,717 --> 00:06:54,718
I think so, too.

27
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:57,068
Paul?

28
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,115
Paul!

29
00:07:52,254 --> 00:07:54,386
Hey Cook,
you got a minute?

30
00:07:55,257 --> 00:07:58,695
All right, ladies and
gents, little announcement.

31
00:07:58,695 --> 00:08:01,350
We have 50-50 raffle
tickets on sale

32
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,221
for Frank's daughter's
soccer team.

33
00:08:03,221 --> 00:08:04,832
Little Kickers.

34
00:08:04,832 --> 00:08:06,442
We love some Little Kickers
'cause they kick a little ass.

35
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:10,359
So your degenerate gambling can
actually go to a good cause.

36
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:11,316
All right?
- Thanks.

37
00:08:11,316 --> 00:08:12,840
Oh, you're welcome.

38
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,191
All right now, so another
day in Paradise awaits us.

39
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:17,540
Before you hit the streets,

40
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,934
I'd like to introduce
our newest team member.

41
00:08:19,934 --> 00:08:22,502
This is Detective Angela Dutton.

42
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,505
Get acquainted, say hello,
welcome her like family,

43
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,332
which means we insult
her to her face

44
00:08:27,332 --> 00:08:29,596
and talk about her
mama behind her back.

45
00:08:29,596 --> 00:08:31,598
Angela comes from Atlanta,

46
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:33,991
and she was accidentally
dropped off in the Bronx,

47
00:08:33,991 --> 00:08:36,777
which I'm amazed
you're not murdered,

48
00:08:36,777 --> 00:08:39,170
and she's gonna be with
us for the long haul.

49
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:41,346
And the best person to
bring her up to speed

50
00:08:41,346 --> 00:08:44,828
is our very own
Detective Deo Russo.

51
00:08:44,828 --> 00:08:47,527
Russo, meet your new partner.

52
00:08:48,876 --> 00:08:51,052
All right, everybody,
be safe out there.

53
00:08:52,662 --> 00:08:54,838
Wal... Walden! Lieutenant?

54
00:08:54,838 --> 00:08:56,666
Lieutenant, can I...

55
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,320
Can I talk to you for a sec?

56
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,802
Just a
second. Keep up, man.

57
00:09:01,802 --> 00:09:04,065
What happened to your face?
What, you can't shave?

58
00:09:04,065 --> 00:09:05,370
Yeah, I
got a skin thing.

59
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,198
I was gonna put in for
a medical exemption.

60
00:09:07,198 --> 00:09:10,027
A medical exemption 'cause
you allergic to a razor?

61
00:09:10,027 --> 00:09:11,028
Man.

62
00:09:11,028 --> 00:09:12,769
Russo, I don't wanna hear that.

63
00:09:13,857 --> 00:09:16,817
Seriously, you
blindside me like this?

64
00:09:16,817 --> 00:09:19,210
What is this,
karmic retribution?

65
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,821
Did I do something to
you or your loved ones

66
00:09:20,821 --> 00:09:21,822
in another life?

67
00:09:21,822 --> 00:09:23,171
Because last I checked,

68
00:09:23,171 --> 00:09:24,868
me and your significant
other get along great.

69
00:09:24,868 --> 00:09:27,349
We both find you to be
equally intolerable.

70
00:09:27,349 --> 00:09:30,918
Listen, man, I was
fine with you goin' solo

71
00:09:30,918 --> 00:09:32,354
when you worked on cold cases,

72
00:09:32,354 --> 00:09:34,878
but now on homicide,
I want you with a partner.

73
00:09:34,878 --> 00:09:36,706
Then put me back on cold case.

74
00:09:38,926 --> 00:09:40,884
Deo, it's been five years.

75
00:09:40,884 --> 00:09:42,494
I know how long it's been.

76
00:09:44,105 --> 00:09:45,759
Probably down to the minute.

77
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:06,997
Look, I got a good
thing goin' here.

78
00:10:09,043 --> 00:10:12,176
I get up alone.
I go to work alone.

79
00:10:13,308 --> 00:10:15,615
I eat alone. I'm like
Macaulay Culkin, man.

80
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,095
I go home alone, I sleep alone.

81
00:10:18,095 --> 00:10:20,445
I don't have to care
about another human being.

82
00:10:20,445 --> 00:10:22,926
It is a sad, sad,
beautiful thing.

83
00:10:22,926 --> 00:10:24,406
I don't want a partner.

84
00:10:24,406 --> 00:10:26,713
Well, you got a partner.
Her name is Angela.

85
00:10:26,713 --> 00:10:28,628
Go out there and
show her around.

86
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:32,283
- She's taking a selfie.
- Oh, come--

87
00:10:32,283 --> 00:10:33,633
So she's taking a selfie.

88
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,678
Man, she needs someone like you,

89
00:10:35,678 --> 00:10:37,332
and you need someone like her.

90
00:10:37,332 --> 00:10:38,420
I need someone?

91
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,813
I need her like I need an enema.

92
00:10:39,813 --> 00:10:41,902
What's she gonna do,
teach me about pop culture?

93
00:10:41,902 --> 00:10:43,904
You're so full of
shit you don't even know

94
00:10:43,904 --> 00:10:45,601
when you need an enema.

95
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:47,081
Come on, you don't socialize.

96
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:49,126
You need more human contact.

97
00:10:49,126 --> 00:10:52,652
And if you won't do it in your
private life, hey, thank me.

98
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,305
Now you can do it at work.

99
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:56,133
Is this a precinct
or a dating app?

100
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:58,179
'Cause I can't tell
the difference.

101
00:10:59,746 --> 00:11:02,923
Look, why don't you just
take the evidence box,

102
00:11:02,923 --> 00:11:05,447
take it across the bridge,
and give it to the DA.

103
00:11:05,447 --> 00:11:06,666
- Is this...
- Yeah, I mean, what?

104
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,145
This the guy? We got him?

105
00:11:08,145 --> 00:11:09,930
It's moving forward. Well,
at least that's good news.

106
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:13,020
Yes, maybe you'll have
a little more good news,

107
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,805
if you, you know, take your
partner across the bridge,

108
00:11:15,805 --> 00:11:17,807
a little scenic
something and, you know,

109
00:11:17,807 --> 00:11:20,984
maybe a nice bagel at Luigi's.

110
00:11:20,984 --> 00:11:23,508
You know, bond
with your partner.

111
00:11:26,468 --> 00:11:27,469
Yay.

112
00:11:31,516 --> 00:11:32,692
What?

113
00:11:34,171 --> 00:11:35,346
Is this because I put the
embarrassing photo of you

114
00:11:35,346 --> 00:11:36,957
up in the precinct and
got everyone to play

115
00:11:36,957 --> 00:11:38,828
"Where's Walden?" for a month?

116
00:11:40,308 --> 00:11:42,049
You're cute, and no.

117
00:11:43,398 --> 00:11:45,008
It's just 'cause I hate you.

118
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:46,531
Get the fuck outta my office.

119
00:11:47,576 --> 00:11:48,969
Tell Bob I said hi.

120
00:11:48,969 --> 00:11:50,884
I ain't tellin' Bob shit!

121
00:11:54,148 --> 00:11:56,933
See, these people don't
realize I know where they live.

122
00:11:56,933 --> 00:11:58,979
Does anybody got some snacks?

123
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:02,983
It's my first day on the job

124
00:12:02,983 --> 00:12:05,986
and I cannot wait to get in
the car with my new partner.

125
00:12:05,986 --> 00:12:08,728
He seems, okay.

126
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,382
Experienced, maybe
a little bit grumpy,

127
00:12:11,382 --> 00:12:13,210
but you know, I mean, I guess

128
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,430
what are you gonna do?

129
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,279
Guess it's you and me?

130
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:39,715
Yeah. Angela.

131
00:12:39,715 --> 00:12:40,934
Deo. Let's go.

132
00:12:44,241 --> 00:12:45,590
Okay.

133
00:12:51,074 --> 00:12:53,120
Your chariot awaits.

134
00:12:53,947 --> 00:12:56,079
And, where are we going?

135
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,995
We need to drive to Manhattan,
take this box to the DA.

136
00:12:59,474 --> 00:13:00,475
Can you drive?

137
00:13:01,693 --> 00:13:02,694
Of course.

138
00:13:07,612 --> 00:13:08,657
Nice catch.

139
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:10,137
Thanks.

140
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,489
Off to a great start, partner.

141
00:13:20,451 --> 00:13:21,452
Know the way?

142
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:24,542
No. No, I do not.

143
00:13:25,761 --> 00:13:27,545
Get outta here
and turn left.

144
00:13:28,503 --> 00:13:29,591
And don't kill me.

145
00:13:31,158 --> 00:13:33,682
I'm not gonna kill you.
Least not today.

146
00:13:34,988 --> 00:13:36,511
Ooh, I'm so excited!

147
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:42,212
All right, makin' a left.

148
00:14:30,695 --> 00:14:31,871
Okay, this is really weird.

149
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,176
Are we just supposed
to drive in silence?

150
00:14:33,176 --> 00:14:34,177
I mean, I thought this
is when we were supposed

151
00:14:34,177 --> 00:14:35,483
to be getting to
know each other.

152
00:14:35,483 --> 00:14:38,703
You know like, bonding,
like gettin' tight.

153
00:14:38,703 --> 00:14:40,314
No, this is the
part where we drive

154
00:14:40,314 --> 00:14:42,707
the evidence box to the DA.

155
00:14:42,707 --> 00:14:43,970
And why am I driving?

156
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,145
Equity.

157
00:14:45,145 --> 00:14:47,016
Why do you think?
To get used to the city.

158
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:51,455
Okay. Hey, first
breakfast on me, partner.

159
00:14:53,457 --> 00:14:55,720
Oh, money bags
over there, huh?

160
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,636
Is that from all your
click clack followers?

161
00:14:58,636 --> 00:15:00,203
Okay, that's not
what it's called.

162
00:15:00,203 --> 00:15:01,509
Whatever.

163
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:04,381
I have 1,297 followers,
thank you very much.

164
00:15:04,381 --> 00:15:05,643
Can you monetize that?

165
00:15:05,643 --> 00:15:07,558
Let's just say
there's room for growth.

166
00:15:09,517 --> 00:15:11,606
But I really just like doing
those challenges, you know?

167
00:15:11,606 --> 00:15:13,869
Like the lip syncing
and the dancing,

168
00:15:13,869 --> 00:15:15,305
you know the--
- Hey, what do you say

169
00:15:15,305 --> 00:15:17,003
we maybe, like, table this
conversation, you know,

170
00:15:17,003 --> 00:15:19,396
give it a rest until after I
get a cup of coffee in my hand.

171
00:15:19,396 --> 00:15:20,920
What do ya think?

172
00:15:21,442 --> 00:15:23,096
Okay. Shavasana.

173
00:15:23,748 --> 00:15:24,924
Gesundheit.

174
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:29,624
No, no, no, no.
That means rest in yoga.

175
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:33,280
So you just...

176
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,767
Okay, so we're gonna stop
at Luigi's and get a coffee

177
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:45,118
and whatever else
you want to eat,

178
00:15:45,118 --> 00:15:46,989
on you of course, moneybags.

179
00:15:47,816 --> 00:15:48,860
Luigi's?

180
00:15:49,122 --> 00:15:50,601
Best bagels in the city.

181
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,126
Well, I'm, uh...

182
00:15:55,171 --> 00:15:56,346
I can't have gluten.

183
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:02,309
Well, have a tomato.

184
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:05,965
No, it's fine.
I'll get a kombucha.

185
00:16:06,878 --> 00:16:07,967
What?

186
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,620
So they're this
really healthy drink

187
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,188
that has live bacteria
and probiotics in it.

188
00:16:12,188 --> 00:16:13,798
You're paying
for bacteria?

189
00:16:13,798 --> 00:16:15,409
Because you know your
intestinal tract

190
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:18,020
is full of bacteria but it's
like really healthy bacteria.

191
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,979
It helps with the--
- I don't wanna know anymore.

192
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,023
I'm sorry, I asked.

193
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:23,199
Okay.

194
00:16:25,071 --> 00:16:27,334
So, they tell me you
usually drive solo.

195
00:16:28,204 --> 00:16:29,989
Sorry if I'm
messing up your chi.

196
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,123
No, no, no, I'm serious.

197
00:16:34,123 --> 00:16:35,951
I mean like, okay,
so I practice yoga,

198
00:16:35,951 --> 00:16:38,649
but I only like to
practice by myself

199
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:40,825
because everybody else's energy

200
00:16:40,825 --> 00:16:42,479
just really throws off my chi.

201
00:16:46,918 --> 00:16:49,095
People really like honking
in this city, don't they?

202
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:51,532
Deo, huh?

203
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:55,579
Like the "Banana Boat" song?

204
00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:58,017
Do not even do it.

205
00:16:58,582 --> 00:17:00,193
What does it mean?

206
00:17:00,193 --> 00:17:02,543
Godlike.

207
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,895
No way.

208
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:07,983
- Yeah.
- No way.

209
00:17:07,983 --> 00:17:08,984
Yeah, I know.

210
00:17:08,984 --> 00:17:10,290
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

211
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,552
You don't, you don't. No.

212
00:17:11,552 --> 00:17:13,902
Angela, it means angel.

213
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:17,601
Gods and angels
protecting and serving.

214
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:19,734
I mean, I cannot
make this shit up.

215
00:17:19,734 --> 00:17:21,127
That is amazing!

216
00:17:21,127 --> 00:17:24,391
Yeah, well, I'm
definitely no god.

217
00:17:26,871 --> 00:17:29,874
Well, I am
definitely an angel.

218
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:37,360
Okay, so this is
Williamsburg Bridge.

219
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,710
What is that bridge over there?

220
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,147
The Queensboro Bridge.

221
00:17:41,147 --> 00:17:43,845
Queens. So does
that go to, like, Queens?

222
00:17:43,845 --> 00:17:45,064
What do you think?

223
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,108
I don't know.

224
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:47,544
Well, Queens is a borough.

225
00:17:47,544 --> 00:17:49,372
It's the Queensboro Bridge.

226
00:17:49,807 --> 00:17:52,767
The Queensboro Bridge
connects Queens to Manhattan.

227
00:17:55,987 --> 00:17:56,945
Sassy.

228
00:17:58,251 --> 00:17:59,904
Let's see, Queens.

229
00:17:59,904 --> 00:18:00,992
Yeah.

230
00:18:00,992 --> 00:18:03,386
We got, now is
Manhattan a borough?

231
00:18:03,386 --> 00:18:05,910
- Yes.
- Okay. What about the Bronx?

232
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,086
It's a borough.

233
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,130
Uh, Harlem.

234
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,305
- Not a borough.
- Not a borough.

235
00:18:09,305 --> 00:18:11,090
Got it. I think
that's all I got.

236
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,091
Staten Island.

237
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,745
Look at you.

238
00:18:14,745 --> 00:18:16,617
- Oh my God.
- You're learning quickly.

239
00:18:16,617 --> 00:18:19,185
Look at me. I'm like a native.

240
00:18:19,185 --> 00:18:20,360
Good job, hayseed.

241
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,101
I'm like I'm from New York.

242
00:18:22,971 --> 00:18:26,583
- Don't do that. Anywhere.
- Don't do what? New York?

243
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:29,412
Is that offensive?

244
00:18:30,718 --> 00:18:31,588
You're gonna love me.

245
00:18:31,588 --> 00:18:33,112
At some point, you will love me.

246
00:18:33,982 --> 00:18:35,157
Maybe not today.

247
00:18:36,985 --> 00:18:38,769
So are we gonna go
near Times Square?

248
00:18:38,769 --> 00:18:40,380
No, it's a shit hole.

249
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,164
Oh! I thought they
like got rid of all the porn

250
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:43,774
and now it's all
nice and fabulous.

251
00:18:43,774 --> 00:18:45,863
Yeah, it's nice
and tourist central,

252
00:18:45,863 --> 00:18:47,213
which is a shit hole.

253
00:18:47,213 --> 00:18:49,128
They were better off when
they had all the porn.

254
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,999
Oh.

255
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:57,005
Okay, the ADA is
out front waiting for us.

256
00:18:57,005 --> 00:18:59,007
Okay, here we are.

257
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,052
It's up here on your right.

258
00:19:01,052 --> 00:19:02,445
You're just gonna find
a place to pull over.

259
00:19:02,445 --> 00:19:03,490
There he is.

260
00:19:08,843 --> 00:19:10,149
Derek!

261
00:19:18,244 --> 00:19:19,593
Thanks so much, man.

262
00:19:19,593 --> 00:19:20,942
Thanks for meeting me out here.

263
00:19:20,942 --> 00:19:22,291
Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

264
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:23,814
- Glad we got the guy.
- Glad we do, too.

265
00:19:23,814 --> 00:19:25,642
With this we'll be
able to nail him.

266
00:19:25,642 --> 00:19:27,035
You get him.

267
00:19:37,915 --> 00:19:38,873
Let's go.

268
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,239
All right? Okay.

269
00:19:57,892 --> 00:20:00,590
We're gonna step over, come on.

270
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,506
Here we go, boy.

271
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,378
Here we go.

272
00:20:07,728 --> 00:20:09,904
Love you, buddy.

273
00:20:09,904 --> 00:20:11,166
Be right back!

274
00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:23,787
Hey, thank you.

275
00:20:26,399 --> 00:20:28,052
Hey, Bill. How you doin'?

276
00:20:28,052 --> 00:20:30,011
- Good, Willy. How you doing?
- I'm good, good. You?

277
00:20:30,011 --> 00:20:31,360
I'm stayin' outta trouble.

278
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,014
Good, good. You do that, man.

279
00:20:33,014 --> 00:20:35,059
I will. You, too.
Pickles are on sale.

280
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:36,539
Pickles. Are they kosher?

281
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:38,367
- They're always kosher, man.
- Oh, okay.

282
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:39,716
'Cause I don't
look at the label.

283
00:20:39,716 --> 00:20:41,022
I hear ya.

284
00:21:03,392 --> 00:21:05,742
Hey. Took ya long enough.

285
00:21:05,742 --> 00:21:07,875
I had to find you something
with bacteria in it.

286
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,790
Oh, okay. Thank you.

287
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,182
Oh, this is good.

288
00:21:11,661 --> 00:21:13,924
Oh!

289
00:21:13,924 --> 00:21:15,926
You do not know
what you're missing.

290
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:17,450
What?

291
00:21:19,408 --> 00:21:22,063
Oh. Yeah, I got a gluten
allergy, I'm afraid.

292
00:21:22,063 --> 00:21:23,151
I do not care.

293
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:26,633
Oh.

294
00:21:27,808 --> 00:21:29,810
Mm, sweet baby Jesus.

295
00:21:33,596 --> 00:21:34,684
"You know what, Angela,

296
00:21:34,684 --> 00:21:36,817
you seem like a
really cool person."

297
00:21:36,817 --> 00:21:38,079
I'd never say that.

298
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:41,038
That is so kind of
you to say. Thank you.

299
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:44,259
Well, you know what, I was
born in Marietta, Georgia.

300
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,306
I'm a Libra, so I get
along with everybody,

301
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,481
and I know what you're thinking.

302
00:21:48,481 --> 00:21:49,743
That you're ruining my bagel.

303
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:51,310
Extroverts do not
make good detectives,

304
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,225
but I have you fooled, darlin',
because I am an outlier.

305
00:21:55,226 --> 00:21:56,880
My dad was in the Air Force.

306
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,491
I wanted to follow
in his footsteps

307
00:21:58,491 --> 00:22:00,971
because he's really my hero,
but I didn't wanna go to war.

308
00:22:00,971 --> 00:22:02,756
So I joined the force,

309
00:22:02,756 --> 00:22:04,975
and I got promoted about a year
and a half ago to detective.

310
00:22:04,975 --> 00:22:06,194
Congratulations.

311
00:22:06,977 --> 00:22:08,457
Thank you.

312
00:22:08,457 --> 00:22:10,329
You know, that almost
sounded sincere.

313
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,463
Married 10 years, no kids,

314
00:22:14,463 --> 00:22:16,247
and I'm just gonna lay
everything out on the table.

315
00:22:16,247 --> 00:22:17,292
- Please don't.
- Put all the cards out there.

316
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:18,598
Prefer you didn't.

317
00:22:18,598 --> 00:22:19,990
He got his tubes tied
without telling me.

318
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,165
You're gonna do it anyway.

319
00:22:21,165 --> 00:22:22,384
And we weren't great
going into COVID,

320
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:23,994
and then after everything
opened back up,

321
00:22:23,994 --> 00:22:25,648
that included his
secretary's legs.

322
00:22:25,648 --> 00:22:26,649
- Wow.
- So I divorced

323
00:22:26,649 --> 00:22:27,911
his fucking cheating ass.

324
00:22:27,911 --> 00:22:29,826
His loss, not mine,
because I am a catch.

325
00:22:29,826 --> 00:22:32,133
I've got an ass like a
25-year-old, I'm great in bed,

326
00:22:32,133 --> 00:22:34,875
and I am so over that
fucking high school drama.

327
00:22:37,704 --> 00:22:38,748
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

328
00:22:40,097 --> 00:22:41,882
That why you moved to
a city 800 miles away

329
00:22:41,882 --> 00:22:43,362
that apparently hates cops?

330
00:22:47,104 --> 00:22:49,019
You know what,
that city is my past.

331
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,239
My family's gone.

332
00:22:52,022 --> 00:22:53,372
My brother lives here now.

333
00:22:54,938 --> 00:22:56,287
This city...

334
00:22:58,246 --> 00:23:00,117
This city is my future.

335
00:23:01,858 --> 00:23:02,729
Well...

336
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:07,429
Your future smells like piss.

337
00:23:09,562 --> 00:23:11,346
Okay, Detective,
what about you?

338
00:23:11,346 --> 00:23:13,696
What's with this lone
wolf mysterious thing

339
00:23:13,696 --> 00:23:14,741
you got goin' on?

340
00:23:14,741 --> 00:23:17,091
All right.
I don't like people.

341
00:23:19,528 --> 00:23:21,878
So I shouldn't
take it personally?

342
00:23:21,878 --> 00:23:24,228
Look around, bubblegum Barbie.

343
00:23:24,228 --> 00:23:27,362
Community is dead.
Journalism is dead.

344
00:23:27,362 --> 00:23:29,538
Narcissism's at
an all-time high.

345
00:23:29,538 --> 00:23:31,584
Flip on the news, if that's
what you wanna call it.

346
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,889
They tell the flocks
what they wanna hear

347
00:23:32,889 --> 00:23:34,500
the way they want
'em to hear it.

348
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,892
As long as it
confirms their bias,

349
00:23:35,892 --> 00:23:37,285
they go along like
good little sheep.

350
00:23:37,285 --> 00:23:39,156
Nobody can think for
themselves anymore.

351
00:23:39,156 --> 00:23:42,421
The politicians and the media
are doing everything they can

352
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,900
to divide the people.

353
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:47,948
Hypocrisy and entitlement
are like fuckin' epidemics.

354
00:23:49,297 --> 00:23:53,475
So I've learned to keep my
expectations for humanity low.

355
00:23:54,781 --> 00:23:56,783
People are generally disappointing.

356
00:23:58,001 --> 00:23:58,959
Maybe.

357
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:03,442
But there are some
really good ones as well.

358
00:24:05,748 --> 00:24:06,793
Life is a team sport.

359
00:24:06,793 --> 00:24:08,316
We are all in this together.

360
00:24:10,187 --> 00:24:11,362
You're gonna have to learn

361
00:24:11,362 --> 00:24:13,364
to trust somebody
eventually, Oscar.

362
00:24:15,976 --> 00:24:16,846
Oscar?

363
00:24:17,934 --> 00:24:18,848
The Grouch.

364
00:24:20,284 --> 00:24:22,461
Isn't that your home,
like, right over there?

365
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,723
- That's cute.
- It's a nice little trashcan.

366
00:24:23,723 --> 00:24:24,985
Yeah.

367
00:24:24,985 --> 00:24:26,334
<i>73.</i>

368
00:24:26,334 --> 00:24:27,291
<i>Central to 12 Squad.</i>

369
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:30,294
I swear, always
when I'm eating.

370
00:24:34,168 --> 00:24:35,082
This guy.

371
00:24:35,082 --> 00:24:36,910
12 Squad Central.

372
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,302
<i>Request a report.</i>

373
00:24:38,302 --> 00:24:40,566
<i>Possible stabbing
4th and Syracuse.</i>

374
00:24:40,566 --> 00:24:42,089
<i>Bus is rolling.</i>

375
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:44,744
- Uh-uh. I drive.
- Of course you do.

376
00:24:44,744 --> 00:24:46,963
12 Squad Central.
Show us responding.

377
00:24:46,963 --> 00:24:48,182
Copy that, 12 Squad.

378
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,280
And you leave all
your shit on the seat

379
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,890
for me?
- Oh, just get in the car.

380
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:02,979
You are so inconsiderate.
- Shut the fuck up.

381
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:23,522
This car
needs a tune-up.

382
00:25:25,001 --> 00:25:26,873
Hey guys, we're on our way
to a stabbing right now,

383
00:25:26,873 --> 00:25:28,614
and this one is
driving like a maniac.

384
00:25:28,614 --> 00:25:30,050
Are you fuckin'
kidding me right now?

385
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:31,399
But I kinda like it.

386
00:25:33,401 --> 00:25:35,403
Do not film me.

387
00:25:35,403 --> 00:25:36,839
Why? Are you camera shy?

388
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:38,188
- We're working.
- I know.

389
00:25:38,188 --> 00:25:40,669
You're doing your
little click clack videos.

390
00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:42,192
It's not called that.

391
00:25:56,424 --> 00:25:58,731
Come on, you gotta
be fuckin' kidding me.

392
00:25:58,731 --> 00:25:59,993
Welcome to New York.

393
00:25:59,993 --> 00:26:01,429
Yeah, seriously.

394
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:04,737
Although, it does remind me
of rush hour in Atlanta.

395
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:07,783
Atlanta?

396
00:26:07,783 --> 00:26:09,393
- Yeah.
- You're gonna sit here

397
00:26:09,393 --> 00:26:12,527
and try to compare
New York City to Atlanta.

398
00:26:12,527 --> 00:26:14,529
I'm just saying the
traffic is shit there, too.

399
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:16,313
Everything's shit there.

400
00:26:16,313 --> 00:26:18,402
What? What
you got against Atlanta?

401
00:26:18,402 --> 00:26:20,274
Atlanta sucks.

402
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:51,566
Sir? Sir?

403
00:26:51,566 --> 00:26:52,654
What's happening?

404
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:54,090
Are you okay?

405
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:55,744
He needs help. He needs help.

406
00:26:55,744 --> 00:26:56,789
I don't know what's going on.

407
00:26:56,789 --> 00:26:59,313
Sir, are you okay?
Can you breathe?

408
00:27:00,096 --> 00:27:01,924
- He needs help.
- Are you okay?

409
00:27:02,403 --> 00:27:03,578
I'm gonna...

410
00:27:03,578 --> 00:27:04,927
All right, sir, I'm
gonna get you help.

411
00:27:04,927 --> 00:27:05,928
Call 911.

412
00:27:08,235 --> 00:27:12,587
Yes, hi, I'm at the corner
of 94th and Denmore.

413
00:27:12,587 --> 00:27:13,936
We need an ambulance right away.

414
00:27:13,936 --> 00:27:17,200
An old man is passed
out on the ground.

415
00:27:19,768 --> 00:27:21,248
No one
listens to me!

416
00:27:21,248 --> 00:27:23,119
Look, oh
man. All right, look.

417
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:24,425
We don't wanna have to--

418
00:27:24,425 --> 00:27:25,861
- Stay the fuck back!
- Don't make us do that.

419
00:27:25,861 --> 00:27:27,123
Put the weapon down!

420
00:27:27,123 --> 00:27:29,909
Get on the ground now!

421
00:27:29,909 --> 00:27:30,910
Get on the ground.

422
00:27:31,911 --> 00:27:32,955
Relax.

423
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,088
- Get on the ground.
- On the ground!

424
00:27:35,088 --> 00:27:36,306
You piece of shit!

425
00:27:38,787 --> 00:27:40,484
We don't wanna hurt you, bro.

426
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,545
Hang back.

427
00:27:59,547 --> 00:28:00,679
10-84.

428
00:28:06,772 --> 00:28:07,947
Back up,
back up, back up.

429
00:28:07,947 --> 00:28:09,165
Let's go. Let's go.
- On the ground!

430
00:28:09,165 --> 00:28:10,384
All right, we got it.
Back up, back up.

431
00:28:11,646 --> 00:28:12,778
Man, we don't wanna
shoot you, all right?

432
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,695
Killed a fuckin'
dumbass today!

433
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,827
Don't make me
fuckin' have to shoot you.

434
00:28:18,827 --> 00:28:20,960
I'm fucking done. Stand back!

435
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,746
You fuckin' got no idea
what I can do.

436
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:29,055
Shut up!

437
00:28:31,753 --> 00:28:32,841
- Hey.
- Hey. What's up?

438
00:28:32,841 --> 00:28:34,016
Looks like you
got your hands full.

439
00:28:34,016 --> 00:28:34,887
Mm.

440
00:28:34,887 --> 00:28:36,279
Can I ask you a favor?

441
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:37,541
If you want to,
go ahead and do it.

442
00:28:37,541 --> 00:28:39,848
12 Squad behind you.

443
00:28:39,848 --> 00:28:40,893
What's up?
- Jesus Christ.

444
00:28:40,893 --> 00:28:42,329
I don't even fuckin' know.

445
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:44,200
This guy, this motherfucker,
he's just been doin',

446
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,680
yeah that shit.

447
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,334
He's been doing that shit.
- Is that a meat cleaver?

448
00:28:47,334 --> 00:28:48,335
You mind if I try?

449
00:28:49,249 --> 00:28:50,729
You know what, be my guest.

450
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,861
Ah!

451
00:28:52,861 --> 00:28:54,080
I'm Detective Deo Russo.

452
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,517
I'm gonna holster my
firearm here, okay?

453
00:28:56,517 --> 00:28:57,779
Just gonna have a talk.

454
00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:59,520
What's your name?

455
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,478
Go fuck your mother
and your sister!

456
00:29:01,478 --> 00:29:03,045
- Hope that's not a family name.
- Fuck off!

457
00:29:03,045 --> 00:29:04,568
Look, listen, man.

458
00:29:04,568 --> 00:29:06,222
Looks like you're just havin'
one of those days, pal.

459
00:29:06,222 --> 00:29:07,876
Hey, just me and you.

460
00:29:07,876 --> 00:29:09,486
You don't really wanna
hurt yourself, do you?

461
00:29:09,486 --> 00:29:11,401
You don't fuckin' know shit!
You don't know what I want.

462
00:29:11,401 --> 00:29:12,533
Know me!

463
00:29:12,533 --> 00:29:13,447
I know that a tough
guy like you,

464
00:29:13,447 --> 00:29:14,535
if you wanna do some damage,

465
00:29:14,535 --> 00:29:16,450
you could do some
real damage, yeah?

466
00:29:17,451 --> 00:29:19,235
Yeah, I might! Okay, okay.

467
00:29:19,235 --> 00:29:21,281
Yeah? Now listen,
listen to me.

468
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:25,154
We don't wanna hurt you
and we don't wanna see you

469
00:29:25,154 --> 00:29:27,548
hurt yourself anymore
than you already have.

470
00:29:28,941 --> 00:29:31,595
No woman, no cry.
No guns, no problems.

471
00:29:31,595 --> 00:29:32,814
No one listens to me!

472
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:35,599
Now, if you just
lower that meat cleaver,

473
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:37,776
you and I can have
a little chitchat.

474
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:38,864
Fuck you, you fucker.

475
00:29:38,864 --> 00:29:40,169
Don't fuckin' think
I won't do it.

476
00:29:40,169 --> 00:29:41,736
All I wanna do is
get you to the hospital

477
00:29:41,736 --> 00:29:42,606
and get you cleaned up.

478
00:29:42,606 --> 00:29:44,217
That looks like that hurts.

479
00:29:45,392 --> 00:29:47,046
Okay, your arm is
not a piece of pizza.

480
00:29:47,046 --> 00:29:48,090
We can do this all day.

481
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:50,049
But I think you
got things to do.

482
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:51,267
I got shit to do.

483
00:29:51,267 --> 00:29:52,747
You had a bad enough day, man.

484
00:29:52,747 --> 00:29:54,793
Yeah, well,
you don't know shit.

485
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,099
Ya know, I know I've
been there. How about that?

486
00:29:57,099 --> 00:29:58,361
Fuck off!

487
00:29:58,361 --> 00:29:59,623
Okay.

488
00:29:59,623 --> 00:30:02,061
Don't tell me what to do.

489
00:30:09,459 --> 00:30:10,983
Where'd you get the taser?

490
00:30:16,858 --> 00:30:18,425
Really feeling yourself, huh?

491
00:30:18,425 --> 00:30:19,643
Yeah, I am.

492
00:30:21,515 --> 00:30:22,603
What's your problem?

493
00:30:22,603 --> 00:30:24,997
You're my problem.
I said hang back.

494
00:30:24,997 --> 00:30:25,954
For no good reason.

495
00:30:25,954 --> 00:30:26,955
Plenty of good reasons.

496
00:30:26,955 --> 00:30:28,217
Bullshit. Name one.

497
00:30:28,217 --> 00:30:29,305
How about the only
one that matters?

498
00:30:29,305 --> 00:30:30,959
I'm your partner
and I asked you to.

499
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:32,526
But you showed me
when it comes to you,

500
00:30:32,526 --> 00:30:34,484
the only thing I can
trust is your damn ego.

501
00:30:34,484 --> 00:30:35,485
Oh, bullshit.

502
00:30:35,485 --> 00:30:37,096
You didn't ask me, you told me,

503
00:30:37,096 --> 00:30:38,662
like you were my fuckin'
superior or something.

504
00:30:38,662 --> 00:30:39,925
Here we go.

505
00:30:39,925 --> 00:30:41,013
You think I don't
know what this is about.

506
00:30:41,013 --> 00:30:42,318
You have been
butthurt ever since

507
00:30:42,318 --> 00:30:43,319
you got placed with a woman.

508
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:44,625
You don't know
shit about fuck.

509
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:46,018
Oh, tell me I'm wrong.

510
00:30:46,018 --> 00:30:47,541
Tell me this isn't some
stereotypical bullshit.

511
00:30:47,541 --> 00:30:48,716
But for the record,

512
00:30:48,716 --> 00:30:49,978
I don't have a problem
with stereotypes.

513
00:30:49,978 --> 00:30:51,850
Most of them are true and
a lot of them are funny,

514
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,068
and if you ask me,
this world could use

515
00:30:53,068 --> 00:30:54,853
some of that truth
and humor that we lost

516
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,245
somewhere along the way.

517
00:30:56,245 --> 00:30:58,813
Nobody fuckin' asked you!

518
00:30:58,813 --> 00:31:00,119
Generally speaking,

519
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:01,511
I think men do some
shit better than women,

520
00:31:01,511 --> 00:31:02,817
and generally speaking,

521
00:31:02,817 --> 00:31:04,471
I think women do some
shit better than men,

522
00:31:04,471 --> 00:31:07,343
neither of which has anything
to do with right the fuck now.

523
00:31:07,343 --> 00:31:10,346
So whatever wokey pokey,
misogynistic, virtue signaling,

524
00:31:10,346 --> 00:31:12,696
victimy horseshit
narrative you got rollin'

525
00:31:12,696 --> 00:31:15,525
through that hayseed brain
of yours, Detective Dutton,

526
00:31:15,525 --> 00:31:17,571
it is so fuckin' wrong,
it's not even funny.

527
00:31:17,571 --> 00:31:19,878
Why don't you two get a room!

528
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,575
Shut the fuck up!

529
00:31:21,575 --> 00:31:22,837
Get up.

530
00:31:25,492 --> 00:31:26,536
Get up.

531
00:31:33,413 --> 00:31:34,936
Clear the way.

532
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,900
Be careful.

533
00:32:05,271 --> 00:32:06,925
Fucking move.
Let's go.

534
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,057
Hey Sarge. Thank you.

535
00:32:09,057 --> 00:32:10,276
Thanks, Detective. Good job.

536
00:32:10,276 --> 00:32:12,234
Thank you. I appreciate that.

537
00:32:12,234 --> 00:32:13,757
Stay back.

538
00:32:16,064 --> 00:32:17,936
Hey. Are we good?

539
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:23,767
Clearly you're
good at what you do

540
00:32:23,767 --> 00:32:24,986
or you wouldn't be here.

541
00:32:26,596 --> 00:32:29,077
Hell, you're probably
better than me.

542
00:32:29,077 --> 00:32:30,905
I'm just an average
detective at best

543
00:32:30,905 --> 00:32:33,429
just trying to make it
through the damn day.

544
00:32:33,429 --> 00:32:34,953
So I highly doubt
Walden would put you

545
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,693
with the likes of me
if you were anything

546
00:32:36,693 --> 00:32:38,957
but fan-fuckin'-tastic
at what you do.

547
00:32:41,698 --> 00:32:42,961
Then what's up?

548
00:32:44,092 --> 00:32:45,964
It's your first shift.

549
00:32:46,921 --> 00:32:48,618
So sue me if I
didn't want anything

550
00:32:48,618 --> 00:32:50,185
to happen to you on day one.

551
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:53,058
I'm not your responsibility.

552
00:32:53,058 --> 00:32:54,711
The hell you aren't.

553
00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:57,845
Around 8 a.m. this morning,
you became mine, I became yours

554
00:32:57,845 --> 00:32:59,978
whether we like it or
not, that's the code.

555
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:04,547
<i>Negative.</i>

556
00:33:05,244 --> 00:33:08,595
Meet me at the hospital.
Keys are in the car.

557
00:33:08,595 --> 00:33:11,163
I'll ride with the
electric slide.

558
00:33:15,863 --> 00:33:16,864
Hey.

559
00:33:19,345 --> 00:33:22,304
Would you have asked me to
hang back if I wasn't a woman?

560
00:33:28,876 --> 00:33:29,920
Probably not.

561
00:33:33,054 --> 00:33:34,186
Let me ask you.

562
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,362
Is that so bad?

563
00:33:38,277 --> 00:33:39,756
<i>Negative.</i>

564
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:52,682
Hey, I'm gonna ride.

565
00:33:52,682 --> 00:33:53,727
You got it.

566
00:34:01,735 --> 00:34:03,824
Just follow the
ambulance. Yeah.

567
00:34:03,824 --> 00:34:06,174
Just breathe, buddy.
We're five minutes out.

568
00:34:06,174 --> 00:34:07,915
Hey, take it easy, pal.

569
00:34:07,915 --> 00:34:10,918
Avery here's gonna take
good care of ya, okay?

570
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:12,528
I'm just trying.

571
00:34:15,749 --> 00:34:17,142
I like it.

572
00:34:17,142 --> 00:34:18,665
Can I get anything outta
him? What do you think?

573
00:34:18,665 --> 00:34:20,232
He's got all kind
of shit in his system.

574
00:34:20,232 --> 00:34:21,929
It'll be a while before you
get any useful information.

575
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:23,148
No harm in trying.

576
00:34:23,148 --> 00:34:24,497
You ready to tell me
your real name, pal?

577
00:34:24,497 --> 00:34:25,715
What do you think?

578
00:34:25,715 --> 00:34:26,934
Oh, Bullet.

579
00:34:27,804 --> 00:34:28,892
Bullet?

580
00:34:30,459 --> 00:34:32,113
Don't you think Blade would
be more appropriate for you?

581
00:34:32,113 --> 00:34:33,245
What did you take?

582
00:34:34,637 --> 00:34:36,726
Everything.

583
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:42,732
Okay, Willy, take a nice
deep breath for me, please.

584
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,909
Good. Okay, one more.

585
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:48,782
Very good. We're almost there.

586
00:34:48,782 --> 00:34:50,218
Don't worry, buddy.

587
00:34:50,218 --> 00:34:52,699
What do you think,
that stabbing yourself,

588
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:54,614
a little bit of an
error in judgment?

589
00:34:55,615 --> 00:34:56,790
All right, I want you
to think about this.

590
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,096
When we get to the hospital,

591
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,401
you can talk to me,
you can talk to the DA.

592
00:34:59,401 --> 00:35:01,534
I promise you I'm
a lot nicer, okay?

593
00:35:01,534 --> 00:35:03,057
Help.

594
00:35:03,057 --> 00:35:05,320
Just breathe,
guy. I am helping you.

595
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,931
She's helping you, she's
giving you the good stuff.

596
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,793
Jesus.

597
00:35:55,718 --> 00:35:57,546
Easy, easy, easy.

598
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,375
And we're off.

599
00:36:04,336 --> 00:36:07,687
I got a perp, self-inflicted
wound, stabbing.

600
00:36:07,687 --> 00:36:10,472
His name's Bullet. I don't
know his real name yet.

601
00:36:10,472 --> 00:36:12,344
Oh yes, we have
him in the system.

602
00:36:17,044 --> 00:36:18,524
My first New York tase.

603
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,008
Comin' through!

604
00:36:25,705 --> 00:36:27,446
My dog.

605
00:36:27,446 --> 00:36:29,448
Please, it's tied up
outside the store.

606
00:36:29,448 --> 00:36:30,318
Hey.

607
00:36:30,318 --> 00:36:31,754
Denmore Street.

608
00:36:31,754 --> 00:36:33,016
Listen pops, I'd love to help.

609
00:36:33,016 --> 00:36:34,627
I'm right in the
middle of a tour.

610
00:36:34,627 --> 00:36:36,759
Please. He's all I have.

611
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,199
You have to help me.
Please get him.

612
00:36:42,722 --> 00:36:45,464
He's all alone.

613
00:36:45,464 --> 00:36:46,943
- What's your name?
- It's Willy.

614
00:36:46,943 --> 00:36:48,641
We'll
take care of him.

615
00:36:48,641 --> 00:36:49,859
Please.

616
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:51,513
Did you see his dog?

617
00:36:51,513 --> 00:36:52,862
Nope. No dog.

618
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:58,303
Oh my God,
will you stop whining?

619
00:36:59,347 --> 00:37:00,696
Listen, what's
your dog's name?

620
00:37:00,696 --> 00:37:02,568
Tango. Tango.

621
00:37:02,568 --> 00:37:04,222
Thank you.
- Tango.

622
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:12,665
Angela, you got the keys?

623
00:37:12,665 --> 00:37:13,883
Why? What are you doing?

624
00:37:13,883 --> 00:37:15,363
I'm gonna go get his dog.

625
00:37:15,363 --> 00:37:17,713
Okay, Dr. Doolittle,
just in case you forgot,

626
00:37:17,713 --> 00:37:19,324
we still have an arrest
we have to complete.

627
00:37:19,324 --> 00:37:21,239
Thought you were an angel.
Where's your sense of heroism?

628
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,632
Okay, I love dogs just
as much as the next person,

629
00:37:23,632 --> 00:37:26,722
but dog heroism is
the ASPCA's job.

630
00:37:26,722 --> 00:37:28,637
And what about you Mr.
I don't like people?

631
00:37:28,637 --> 00:37:30,030
Dogs aren't people.
They're loyal.

632
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,640
Besides, I thought we
were all in this together,

633
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,903
or was that just part of your
after school special speech?

634
00:37:33,903 --> 00:37:36,254
Look, post a video
of a dog rescue,

635
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:39,257
I bet you double your followers
on your little click clack.

636
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,823
Again, it's not called that.

637
00:37:40,823 --> 00:37:43,130
Again, I do not care.
Please process it for me.

638
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:44,697
Here's the keys to the cuffs.

639
00:37:45,785 --> 00:37:47,569
If he shits or pisses
in the back of the car,

640
00:37:47,569 --> 00:37:48,918
you're cleaning it up.

641
00:37:48,918 --> 00:37:50,964
Funny, I told Walden
the same thing about you.

642
00:37:50,964 --> 00:37:53,488
You're
such a comedian.

643
00:37:53,488 --> 00:37:55,098
Gods and angels protecting
and serving, right?

644
00:37:55,098 --> 00:37:56,448
You are definitely not a god.

645
00:37:56,448 --> 00:37:58,101
And you're
definitely no angel.

646
00:37:58,101 --> 00:37:59,146
Beg to differ.

647
00:38:19,514 --> 00:38:21,603
- Hey, Logan.
- Hey.

648
00:38:21,603 --> 00:38:23,213
- Let's have a chat.
- Yeah.

649
00:38:23,953 --> 00:38:24,998
Come on in.

650
00:38:26,782 --> 00:38:27,914
It's a nice place you got.

651
00:38:27,914 --> 00:38:30,177
Yeah. Fuckin'
Valenti send you?

652
00:38:31,526 --> 00:38:32,658
Huh?

653
00:38:32,658 --> 00:38:34,181
Let's have a seat.
Let's have a seat.

654
00:38:34,181 --> 00:38:35,269
Yep.

655
00:38:35,269 --> 00:38:37,184
Yeah, get
comfortable all right.

656
00:38:38,664 --> 00:38:39,621
Thanks.

657
00:38:40,535 --> 00:38:41,493
Jack.

658
00:38:42,624 --> 00:38:44,322
Just gonna sit
down and relax a bit.

659
00:38:45,148 --> 00:38:46,759
Dad, what the fuck?

660
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,897
Sit your fuckin'
ass down. Go ahead.

661
00:38:56,029 --> 00:38:56,986
Sit down.

662
00:38:56,986 --> 00:38:58,858
- That's my son, man.
- Sit.

663
00:39:00,207 --> 00:39:01,208
Sit down.

664
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:02,514
Leave my son alone.

665
00:39:02,514 --> 00:39:03,428
Go ahead, sit down.
He's good, he's good.

666
00:39:03,428 --> 00:39:04,603
- Yeah?
- Yeah, he's good.

667
00:39:04,603 --> 00:39:06,039
Right? Come on.

668
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,873
Daddy's a fuckin' troublemaker.

669
00:39:13,873 --> 00:39:15,527
Pal, you're okay.

670
00:39:17,746 --> 00:39:18,921
He's good.

671
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:29,192
So look, I don't
wanna waste time.

672
00:39:29,192 --> 00:39:32,065
I don't wanna look around
this shit hole. Where is it?

673
00:39:36,896 --> 00:39:37,897
Where's what?

674
00:39:38,898 --> 00:39:40,334
Hands behind your back.

675
00:39:40,334 --> 00:39:41,422
Where is it?

676
00:39:41,422 --> 00:39:42,728
It's not here [chuckles],
I'm--

677
00:39:42,728 --> 00:39:44,207
Where is it, then?

678
00:39:44,207 --> 00:39:46,166
How about you let me
talk to your boss, Jack.

679
00:39:46,166 --> 00:39:49,299
If the boss wanted to talk
to you, he'd be here right now.

680
00:39:52,346 --> 00:39:53,956
- I got you.
- It's not here.

681
00:39:53,956 --> 00:39:55,958
- Where is it?
- It's gone.

682
00:40:00,093 --> 00:40:02,835
Throw my fuckin' kid around
my fuckin' house?

683
00:40:02,835 --> 00:40:06,186
All right, Logan. Logan.

684
00:40:07,274 --> 00:40:09,015
Logan, here's what
we're gonna do.

685
00:40:09,015 --> 00:40:10,712
I'm just gonna ask you questions

686
00:40:10,712 --> 00:40:13,889
and you're gonna either nod
or shake your head, okay?

687
00:40:13,889 --> 00:40:16,414
So, okay?

688
00:40:17,937 --> 00:40:18,938
You say it's not here.

689
00:40:18,938 --> 00:40:22,550
Did you move it somewhere?

690
00:40:26,032 --> 00:40:26,989
No.

691
00:40:28,469 --> 00:40:31,254
Logan, did you sell
it to someone else?

692
00:40:37,347 --> 00:40:38,653
Because they paid more?

693
00:40:40,742 --> 00:40:41,743
Yeah.

694
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:46,705
Logan.

695
00:40:54,408 --> 00:40:56,628
All right,
buddy boy, come on up.

696
00:40:58,238 --> 00:40:59,282
Relax.

697
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:07,769
I'm just, I don't understand

698
00:41:07,769 --> 00:41:09,467
what you thought
was gonna happen.

699
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,772
What did you think
was gonna happen?

700
00:41:10,772 --> 00:41:12,513
Did you think the boss would,

701
00:41:12,513 --> 00:41:13,906
what did you think he would say?

702
00:41:13,906 --> 00:41:15,473
What do you think the boss--

703
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,039
Hey, hey, hey.

704
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:19,651
Okay...

705
00:41:21,653 --> 00:41:22,741
We're having a conversation.

706
00:41:23,785 --> 00:41:26,309
Hey, make it
easy for us, okay?

707
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:29,182
You did what you did,

708
00:41:29,878 --> 00:41:32,185
so now you gotta accept
the consequences.

709
00:41:33,229 --> 00:41:34,579
Yeah?

710
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:39,279
Okay, so let's
talk rationally.

711
00:41:39,279 --> 00:41:42,630
What do you think he would
say to you, congratulations?

712
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:44,676
"Logan, you're a champ.
You're a good capitalist.

713
00:41:44,676 --> 00:41:46,112
You know how to work the market.

714
00:41:46,112 --> 00:41:48,723
Well done, you made a profit."

715
00:41:48,723 --> 00:41:49,855
I mean fuck.

716
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:53,511
So strange. Take this shit off.

717
00:41:56,165 --> 00:41:57,863
Shh. It's okay.

718
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,562
I needed money.

719
00:42:05,697 --> 00:42:07,046
I owed people money.

720
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:10,049
- That's it?
- Jack, you know me.

721
00:42:10,049 --> 00:42:11,703
You've known me a long time.

722
00:42:11,703 --> 00:42:13,095
I'm not gonna fuck you over.

723
00:42:13,095 --> 00:42:15,271
You guys are at the top
of my priority list, man.

724
00:42:15,271 --> 00:42:18,579
We go back. I'm good for it.

725
00:42:18,579 --> 00:42:20,189
I'm gonna get the
money back to you.

726
00:42:20,189 --> 00:42:21,669
Just let me and my kid go,

727
00:42:21,669 --> 00:42:23,671
and I'll go out and
I'll get the money.

728
00:42:23,671 --> 00:42:25,847
So, okay.

729
00:42:28,197 --> 00:42:30,809
I got no product,
I got no money,

730
00:42:30,809 --> 00:42:33,202
but I have your fuckin' word?

731
00:42:33,202 --> 00:42:36,379
My word, bro.
I'm fuckin' good for this.

732
00:42:36,379 --> 00:42:38,512
Just tape him up.

733
00:42:38,512 --> 00:42:39,861
Man, I swear to you.

734
00:42:39,861 --> 00:42:41,820
It's not like before, I'm
not gonna fuckin' do it.

735
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:44,474
Jesus.

736
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:46,781
Shh. Shh.

737
00:42:48,261 --> 00:42:51,394
My hands are tied,
like yours.

738
00:42:51,394 --> 00:42:53,745
That was
good. That's funny.

739
00:42:54,093 --> 00:42:56,051
I know. It's true.

740
00:42:56,051 --> 00:42:58,967
His hands are tied.

741
00:42:58,967 --> 00:43:00,708
My hands are tied, too.

742
00:43:03,493 --> 00:43:06,192
Fuck, you stupid asshole.

743
00:43:06,192 --> 00:43:09,456
Somebody has to pay 'cause
that's the way this shit works.

744
00:43:09,456 --> 00:43:11,893
I didn't fuckin' invent
the fuckin' order,

745
00:43:11,893 --> 00:43:14,592
but that's the way it works,
and that's the bad news.

746
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:16,898
But here's the good news.

747
00:43:16,898 --> 00:43:18,987
I'm gonna give you options

748
00:43:20,467 --> 00:43:23,252
'cause we've known each
other a while, you're right.

749
00:43:23,252 --> 00:43:25,124
Okay, Option A, you die.

750
00:43:25,124 --> 00:43:28,910
Your son, he lives, fuckin'
jerk off every day he wants to,

751
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:30,738
and skateboard, do
whatever the fuck he does

752
00:43:30,738 --> 00:43:32,740
the rest of his life.

753
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:35,134
To be a fuck-up like
you or not, maybe not.

754
00:43:36,265 --> 00:43:37,615
Most likely.

755
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,747
Option B, your son
pays your debt for you.

756
00:43:39,747 --> 00:43:41,619
- No. No!
- No, but listen.

757
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:42,837
No, but listen.

758
00:43:42,837 --> 00:43:43,925
- No. Just fuckin' kill me.
- I get it.

759
00:43:43,925 --> 00:43:45,927
Shh, shh, shh, but listen.

760
00:43:45,927 --> 00:43:47,625
Think of it this way. Listen.

761
00:43:49,017 --> 00:43:50,584
You go to therapy, you cry,

762
00:43:50,584 --> 00:43:53,282
and you go back to
your own fuckin' life.

763
00:43:53,282 --> 00:43:56,938
Do whatever the fuck it
is you wanna do. Clean.

764
00:43:56,938 --> 00:43:58,461
- No. No.
- No, but listen.

765
00:43:58,461 --> 00:44:01,464
We put him in there so you
didn't have to look at him,

766
00:44:01,464 --> 00:44:02,770
or he doesn't have
to look at you

767
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:05,773
while you're makin'
this choice, all right?

768
00:44:05,773 --> 00:44:07,949
I did that for you. Okay?

769
00:44:07,949 --> 00:44:11,692
So just relax, and I need you
to pull your fuckin' pants up,

770
00:44:11,692 --> 00:44:14,129
your big boy pants,
put your thinking cap on,

771
00:44:14,129 --> 00:44:17,698
and I need you to
think hard, okay?

772
00:44:17,698 --> 00:44:22,572
Listen, I promise if
you choose the kid,

773
00:44:22,572 --> 00:44:25,532
I'm gonna make it as quick
as possible. I promise.

774
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,709
Okay? So go ahead.

775
00:44:28,709 --> 00:44:31,320
You're gonna think about it,
and I'm gonna give you...

776
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,714
- Please, man.
- ...30 seconds.

777
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:37,239
Shh.

778
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:39,546
Just you say the word
and it'll be quick, okay?

779
00:44:52,907 --> 00:44:54,387
Logan, Logan.

780
00:44:55,475 --> 00:44:56,345
Logan.

781
00:44:56,345 --> 00:44:58,173
- What?
- Look at me.

782
00:44:58,696 --> 00:44:59,697
Logan.

783
00:45:01,742 --> 00:45:05,224
You want your kid growing up
in this fuckin' world anyway?

784
00:45:10,359 --> 00:45:11,534
15.

785
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,715
You want me
to kill my fuckin' kid.

786
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,455
- Shh.
- Seven,

787
00:45:19,934 --> 00:45:21,022
Six,

788
00:45:21,022 --> 00:45:23,242
Don't make me to
kill my fuckin'...

789
00:45:23,242 --> 00:45:24,896
- Five.
- Shh.

790
00:45:24,896 --> 00:45:26,593
- Four.
- Shh.

791
00:45:27,159 --> 00:45:28,421
Three.

792
00:45:29,465 --> 00:45:30,553
Okay.

793
00:45:49,703 --> 00:45:51,183
What the--

794
00:45:55,361 --> 00:45:57,711
Give up your own fuckin' kid.

795
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,651
Let's fuckin' go.

796
00:47:37,376 --> 00:47:39,073
You must be Tango.

797
00:47:39,073 --> 00:47:41,119
You're not gonna bite
my hand off, are ya?

798
00:47:42,685 --> 00:47:45,210
All right, so I want
that on whole wheat,

799
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:49,083
but I want only one
of the slices toasted.

800
00:47:51,912 --> 00:47:53,218
Oh, look at you.

801
00:47:53,218 --> 00:47:56,177
You're a handsome
fella. You're all wet.

802
00:47:56,177 --> 00:47:59,006
Oh, let me get you some
water. I'll be right back.

803
00:48:02,488 --> 00:48:06,013
I'll have the,
the Muenster.

804
00:48:06,013 --> 00:48:07,885
The mayonnaise on the
side that's not toasted

805
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,016
'cause it like sinks in.

806
00:48:09,016 --> 00:48:11,627
Hey, man, I got
my dog outside.

807
00:48:11,627 --> 00:48:14,848
You don't happen to have a bowl
of water or a cup of water?

808
00:48:14,848 --> 00:48:16,894
- No.
- Anything back there?

809
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:19,505
Anything else?

810
00:48:19,505 --> 00:48:21,202
You could put
bacon on it, too.

811
00:48:21,202 --> 00:48:23,683
- Bacon on it too?
- Yep. Lettuce, tomato's good.

812
00:48:23,683 --> 00:48:25,032
Lettuce, tomato's always good.

813
00:48:25,032 --> 00:48:27,121
- Thank you. I appreciate it.
- There you go.

814
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,866
Let me get on a spinach wrap,

815
00:48:32,866 --> 00:48:35,303
chipotle mayo on there
with the smoked Gouda.

816
00:48:38,959 --> 00:48:40,743
Want some water? You thirsty?

817
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:50,623
<i>Central requesting units,</i>

818
00:48:50,623 --> 00:48:51,929
<i>in the vicinity of Denmore
and Cornerstone.</i>

819
00:48:54,801 --> 00:48:56,194
Central 12 Squad,

820
00:48:56,194 --> 00:48:57,586
you're not gonna believe this,
but I'm in the area.

821
00:48:57,586 --> 00:48:59,545
I could be there in three.

822
00:48:59,545 --> 00:49:00,850
<i>Well, it's your lucky day.</i>

823
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:04,680
Report of shots fired
at 420 East Cornerstone.

824
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:05,855
<i>Unit 312.</i>

825
00:49:05,855 --> 00:49:07,945
All right, dispatch,
show me on scene.

826
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,555
Central, send additional units.

827
00:49:09,555 --> 00:49:10,817
Copy that, 12 Squad.

828
00:49:12,297 --> 00:49:13,951
Hey, what do you think, pal?

829
00:49:14,647 --> 00:49:17,345
Wanna go on a little
adventure? Come on.

830
00:49:19,434 --> 00:49:21,959
Wanna hop in there? Good boy.

831
00:49:54,513 --> 00:49:56,863
Tango, I'll be right back.

832
00:51:09,588 --> 00:51:11,068
That's a good boy.

833
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:20,251
Hey!

834
00:51:21,904 --> 00:51:23,732
Got here as fast as I could.

835
00:51:23,732 --> 00:51:24,951
What's with this weather?

836
00:51:24,951 --> 00:51:26,083
It'll pass.

837
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:28,563
You process our collar?

838
00:51:28,563 --> 00:51:30,087
Yeah, all taken care of.

839
00:51:31,914 --> 00:51:33,394
Killed a father and a son.

840
00:51:33,394 --> 00:51:35,918
Looks like a double
homicide, but I don't know.

841
00:51:38,965 --> 00:51:40,749
Well, I checked on his dad.

842
00:51:40,749 --> 00:51:43,143
He's gonna be in a couple
weeks, but he'll be okay.

843
00:51:44,188 --> 00:51:45,145
Oh.

844
00:51:45,145 --> 00:51:47,887
Huh, buddy? Huh?

845
00:51:47,887 --> 00:51:49,106
- <i>Hey.</i>
- Yeah?

846
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:51,760
Meet me for lunch
at our place in 10.

847
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,240
Why?

848
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,894
Because I wanna know how
the honeymooners are doing

849
00:51:54,894 --> 00:51:56,591
and because I said so.

850
00:52:00,204 --> 00:52:02,119
Did he just hang up?

851
00:52:06,819 --> 00:52:08,255
I should poison him.

852
00:52:09,169 --> 00:52:12,433
Boss is makin' us
eat with her. Let's go.

853
00:52:12,433 --> 00:52:13,608
Okay.

854
00:52:42,507 --> 00:52:44,552
Open this door.
Paul? Paul?

855
00:52:45,988 --> 00:52:47,251
Open this door.

856
00:52:48,469 --> 00:52:51,037
Open this door! Paul?

857
00:52:52,691 --> 00:52:55,302
Feels like we're a
family now, ya know?

858
00:52:55,302 --> 00:52:58,871
Yeah. We've never had that.

859
00:52:58,871 --> 00:53:00,481
No?

860
00:53:00,481 --> 00:53:05,007
No, I mean, his dad left
when he was so little, ya know?

861
00:53:05,007 --> 00:53:09,534
He's never really known a dad.

862
00:53:12,798 --> 00:53:13,799
No pressure.

863
00:53:13,799 --> 00:53:15,844
Okay. Okay.

864
00:53:15,844 --> 00:53:18,195
Paul, I know what you're
fucking doing in there!

865
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,327
Paul, open this fucking door.

866
00:53:24,549 --> 00:53:27,378
Danny, get your backpack,
baby. We gotta go to school.

867
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:33,122
I got us a new apartment.

868
00:53:33,122 --> 00:53:35,212
We're gonna be leaving
at the end of the month.

869
00:53:43,959 --> 00:53:45,091
Why?

870
00:53:47,267 --> 00:53:48,225
Why?

871
00:53:51,793 --> 00:53:53,578
Are you fucking kidding? Why?

872
00:53:56,537 --> 00:53:58,409
You know why.
You're using again?

873
00:54:00,759 --> 00:54:02,326
Good, I'm glad you're
not even gonna deny it.

874
00:54:02,326 --> 00:54:04,328
Maybe now you can get some help.

875
00:54:04,328 --> 00:54:06,460
I'm fine, Sandy. I'm fine.

876
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:09,246
Don't lie to me.
Don't do that.

877
00:54:10,899 --> 00:54:11,900
I love you.

878
00:54:16,035 --> 00:54:17,384
Don't do this, Sandy.

879
00:54:17,384 --> 00:54:19,821
I'm not doing
anything. You did this.

880
00:54:19,821 --> 00:54:21,823
I told you from
the very beginning

881
00:54:21,823 --> 00:54:24,826
that I would never ever
put myself or my kid

882
00:54:24,826 --> 00:54:26,915
in this position ever again,

883
00:54:26,915 --> 00:54:28,874
and you promised me
that I would never

884
00:54:28,874 --> 00:54:30,745
have to worry about that.

885
00:54:30,745 --> 00:54:31,920
- I've been--
- I don't even know

886
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:32,878
why we're talking about it.

887
00:54:32,878 --> 00:54:34,009
It's not a discussion.

888
00:54:34,009 --> 00:54:35,837
I put a deposit down.
We're leaving.

889
00:54:36,969 --> 00:54:38,579
No.

890
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:42,931
I'm sorry, what?

891
00:54:42,931 --> 00:54:47,762
You're not leaving.
I decided, no.

892
00:54:47,762 --> 00:54:48,981
I am leaving.

893
00:54:48,981 --> 00:54:50,591
I've put a deposit
down on an apartment.

894
00:54:50,591 --> 00:54:51,810
- We are leaving.
- Nobody

895
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:54,203
is fucking leaving me!

I have no idea
why, but this is...

906
00:55:26,497 --> 00:55:28,499
She loves to shit herself.

907
00:55:28,499 --> 00:55:30,196
Nice.

908
00:55:30,979 --> 00:55:32,329
- What...
- Heard that.

909
00:55:34,287 --> 00:55:36,463
You can't take
him anywhere, huh?

910
00:55:36,463 --> 00:55:37,899
- I try not to.
- Yeah.

911
00:55:38,465 --> 00:55:39,510
Mm-hmm.

912
00:55:42,164 --> 00:55:43,340
Hey,
how is everyone?

913
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,515
Good. How are you?

914
00:55:44,515 --> 00:55:46,081
Would
you like some menus?

915
00:55:46,821 --> 00:55:47,909
Go right ahead.

916
00:55:47,909 --> 00:55:48,997
One
cheeseburger, one philly.

917
00:55:48,997 --> 00:55:50,347
Okay.

918
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:53,088
- I'll have the usual.
- Usual. And?

919
00:55:53,088 --> 00:55:54,829
I'll just do a burger
and a salad, please.

920
00:55:54,829 --> 00:55:56,004
Gluten-free, please.

921
00:55:56,701 --> 00:55:57,745
Absolutely. Be right back.

922
00:55:57,745 --> 00:55:59,834
Thanks. Don't gimme that look.

923
00:55:59,834 --> 00:56:01,836
You gotta make sure
your water's gluten-free.

924
00:56:01,836 --> 00:56:02,924
- You know what?
- You should have told her.

925
00:56:02,924 --> 00:56:05,187
You and your sass
today? I cannot.

926
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:07,929
Oh boy.

927
00:56:07,929 --> 00:56:10,802
Hoping that you had
some bonding time.

928
00:56:10,802 --> 00:56:12,020
Oh yeah.

929
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:14,762
We're just, you
know, peas in a pod.

930
00:56:14,762 --> 00:56:16,373
Just really enjoying today.

931
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:17,417
Know what's funny?

932
00:56:17,417 --> 00:56:18,810
Now there's two
of us against him

933
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:20,942
and he's just gonna, ooh-wee.

934
00:56:22,248 --> 00:56:24,511
I cannot.
- Pray for him.

935
00:56:24,511 --> 00:56:26,644
You know, I do every day.

936
00:56:26,644 --> 00:56:30,561
Oh, and today being the
first day, startin' off strong.

937
00:56:30,561 --> 00:56:32,954
I am. Well, thank you so
much for treatin', Boss.

938
00:56:32,954 --> 00:56:33,868
I really appreciate it.
- Oh, not a problem.

939
00:56:33,868 --> 00:56:35,174
It's a business expense.

940
00:56:35,174 --> 00:56:37,263
- Ah, there it is.
- Oh, okay. Fair enough.

941
00:56:37,263 --> 00:56:38,699
- Thank you.
- Of course.

942
00:56:38,699 --> 00:56:39,874
Be right back.

943
00:56:39,874 --> 00:56:42,834
So, I spoke with the DA.

944
00:56:42,834 --> 00:56:46,707
He's confident that the
prosecution is going our way.

945
00:56:46,707 --> 00:56:48,100
One second.

946
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:49,710
Can I order another one
of these to go, please?

947
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:50,755
- Absolutely.
- Thank you. On her.

948
00:56:50,755 --> 00:56:51,712
Yeah. Thanks.

949
00:56:51,712 --> 00:56:52,539
So you were saying?

950
00:56:52,539 --> 00:56:54,193
I spoke with the DA.

951
00:56:54,193 --> 00:56:57,065
I just wanna make sure you're,
you know, sure on the motive.

952
00:56:58,197 --> 00:57:00,721
Twice convicted on possession
with intent to distribute?

953
00:57:00,721 --> 00:57:01,896
Yeah, I feel strong.

954
00:57:01,896 --> 00:57:04,116
Hm-mmm.
It was a fentanyl issue.

955
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:06,727
I don't know what
causes more deaths,

956
00:57:06,727 --> 00:57:09,295
the war on drugs or--
- Or the drug itself?

957
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:14,561
I'm sorry, today wasn't
exactly what I expected

958
00:57:14,561 --> 00:57:16,258
to be for you to bond.

959
00:57:16,258 --> 00:57:17,999
Oh no, we're gettin'
married next Tuesday.

960
00:57:17,999 --> 00:57:19,218
- Uh.
- Oh.

961
00:57:19,218 --> 00:57:20,437
Oh, I already
picked out my dress.

962
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:21,438
Oh, well you got

963
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:22,830
a flower girl.
- I'm so excited.

964
00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:24,484
Here is
your second burger.

965
00:57:24,484 --> 00:57:26,443
Thank you. I appreciate that.
Can I have another box, too?

966
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:27,748
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

967
00:57:29,968 --> 00:57:31,926
- I guess he's hungry. Oh!
- Thanks for lunch.

968
00:57:31,926 --> 00:57:34,102
In the 11 years that
we've done this together,

969
00:57:34,102 --> 00:57:35,539
it's only happened what, twice?

970
00:57:35,539 --> 00:57:36,540
Thank you.
- Come on, man.

971
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:37,845
There's been plenty of dinners

972
00:57:37,845 --> 00:57:39,760
that I have bought
for everybody.

973
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:44,286
Lunch, dinner, drinks. Okay.

974
00:57:44,286 --> 00:57:45,766
I mean, would
you like mine, too?

975
00:57:45,766 --> 00:57:46,767
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh!

976
00:57:46,767 --> 00:57:48,465
I'll just take that.

977
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,031
Thank you so much.

978
00:57:50,031 --> 00:57:52,773
- Well, I am so glad--
- You're so generous.

979
00:57:52,773 --> 00:57:54,035
Thank you.

980
00:57:54,035 --> 00:57:56,473
Well, I'm glad I could
help at my expense,

981
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:59,476
but at least you guys
are getting along.

982
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:00,868
You owe me a chicken, man.

983
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:04,306
I guess we're leaving now.

984
00:58:04,306 --> 00:58:05,786
Yeah.
And you know what?

985
00:58:05,786 --> 00:58:07,179
Thank you for lunch.

986
00:58:09,137 --> 00:58:11,879
Well, I think he likes you.

987
00:58:12,619 --> 00:58:15,013
I am terrified to see
the people he doesn't like.

988
00:58:15,666 --> 00:58:18,451
Well, just give him some
time and he'll grow on you.

989
00:58:18,451 --> 00:58:21,628
Yeah, like
a fuckin' cold sore.

990
00:58:21,628 --> 00:58:22,847
I'll see ya later.

991
00:58:43,868 --> 00:58:45,609
That asshole has

992
00:58:45,609 --> 00:58:46,827
a dog?

993
00:58:56,228 --> 00:58:57,359
Give him some
slack for a second,

994
00:58:57,359 --> 00:58:58,491
I wanna see something.

995
00:58:58,491 --> 00:58:59,927
- Okay.
- Stay.

996
00:59:00,928 --> 00:59:02,016
Will you roll?

997
00:59:02,016 --> 00:59:03,104
Can you roll?

998
00:59:03,104 --> 00:59:05,933
Oh my God.

999
00:59:07,718 --> 00:59:09,763
He's just
like [grunts].

1000
00:59:12,461 --> 00:59:14,072
You got cheese on you.

1001
00:59:14,899 --> 00:59:17,031
Stay. Relax.

1002
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,384
I think he just nodded.

1003
00:59:23,603 --> 00:59:24,822
Sit. Sit.

1004
00:59:24,822 --> 00:59:25,866
He's a good boy.

1005
00:59:25,866 --> 00:59:27,868
Relax. Yeah.

1006
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:32,394
You're so smart. You're
smarter than my partner.

1007
00:59:32,394 --> 00:59:34,353
You know what,
I resent that remark.

1008
00:59:34,353 --> 00:59:35,572
- Uh-huh.
- But you did

1009
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:36,921
just call me partner.

1010
00:59:37,661 --> 00:59:39,706
- It was a slip of the tongue.
- Oh, was it?

1011
00:59:39,706 --> 00:59:40,925
- Freudian slip.
- I see.

1012
00:59:40,925 --> 00:59:42,056
Yeah.

1013
00:59:42,796 --> 00:59:43,841
Okay.

1014
00:59:43,841 --> 00:59:45,364
Yes you are,
you're a pretty boy.

1015
00:59:45,364 --> 00:59:46,713
I think you're in love.

1016
00:59:46,713 --> 00:59:48,628
He's so handsome.

1017
00:59:59,291 --> 01:00:00,771
Come on, buddy.

1018
01:00:28,363 --> 01:00:29,800
I know, buddy.

1019
01:00:52,823 --> 01:00:54,259
You droppin' off?

1020
01:00:54,259 --> 01:00:55,608
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1021
01:00:55,608 --> 01:00:57,784
So, you're gonna have
to fill out a AHS form,

1022
01:00:57,784 --> 01:01:01,483
a surrender consent,
proof of vaccinations,

1023
01:01:01,483 --> 01:01:04,312
dietary restrictions, and...

1024
01:01:04,312 --> 01:01:05,792
His owner's in the hospital.

1025
01:01:05,792 --> 01:01:07,620
He'll be out in
like three weeks.

1026
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:10,362
Dog's name is Tango,
but that's all I got for ya.

1027
01:01:12,146 --> 01:01:13,365
Well, he just left.

1028
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:18,892
- Gimme a second.
- Mm-hmm.

1029
01:01:22,853 --> 01:01:24,681
Why'd they even come in here?

1030
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:27,945
It's okay, buddy.

1031
01:01:27,945 --> 01:01:29,947
Cruella here promises
not to do it again.

1032
01:01:29,947 --> 01:01:31,513
Isn't that right, de Vil?

1033
01:01:31,513 --> 01:01:33,690
'Mkay. You know what?

1034
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,996
If I can give the
dog a second chance,

1035
01:01:35,996 --> 01:01:37,824
you can give humans
a second chance.

1036
01:01:37,824 --> 01:01:39,913
I don't think that's
a fair exchange.

1037
01:01:39,913 --> 01:01:41,349
Oh my God, you
are so stubborn.

1038
01:01:41,349 --> 01:01:43,656
Just take the deal.

1039
01:01:43,656 --> 01:01:45,092
If I take the deal,
will you shut up?

1040
01:01:45,092 --> 01:01:47,094
No. No, I will not shut up.

1041
01:01:47,094 --> 01:01:48,530
But I will change the subject,

1042
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:51,055
or I could just keep asking
you personal questions

1043
01:01:51,055 --> 01:01:52,317
and annoy the shit outta you.

1044
01:01:52,317 --> 01:01:53,840
Fine!

1045
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:54,885
Repeat after me.

1046
01:01:54,885 --> 01:01:56,451
I will give humans
a second chance.

1047
01:01:56,451 --> 01:01:58,845
So dumb. So dumb.

1048
01:01:58,845 --> 01:02:00,586
- Just say it.
- So dumb.

1049
01:02:00,586 --> 01:02:02,501
I will give humans
a second chance.

1050
01:02:02,501 --> 01:02:05,417
I will give humans a
second chance. There.

1051
01:02:05,417 --> 01:02:07,724
See? So godlike of you.

1052
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:09,073
See, now that's why
I don't do this shit.

1053
01:02:09,073 --> 01:02:10,727
So, how does it feel?
You're gonna give humans

1054
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,206
a second chance,
- Feels idiotic.

1055
01:02:12,206 --> 01:02:13,555
and you're gonna stop
being such a pussy about it.

1056
01:02:13,555 --> 01:02:15,166
Excuse me, I am not
being a pussy about it.

1057
01:02:15,166 --> 01:02:16,515
You're kinda being a pussy.

1058
01:02:16,515 --> 01:02:17,734
You got a mouth on you.

1059
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:18,822
That's what she said.

1060
01:02:21,476 --> 01:02:22,564
That's good.

1061
01:02:22,564 --> 01:02:24,436
- Ah, thank you.
- Actually good.

1062
01:02:24,436 --> 01:02:26,481
- I got you to smile.
- I didn't see that comin'.

1063
01:02:26,481 --> 01:02:28,570
- Ah, well.
- That's what she said.

1064
01:02:28,570 --> 01:02:29,920
It's true.

1065
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:33,793
Oh man.

1066
01:02:33,793 --> 01:02:35,229
Till it hit her
right in the eye.

1067
01:02:35,229 --> 01:02:36,753
Oh!

1068
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,145
- She saw that.
- What do they call that?

1069
01:02:38,145 --> 01:02:39,320
She saw that.

1070
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,365
What do they... well,
she may not have,

1071
01:02:40,365 --> 01:02:41,758
depending on the angle.

1072
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,411
What do they call that?

1073
01:02:43,411 --> 01:02:44,891
It's not a cream pie, is it?

1074
01:02:49,809 --> 01:02:51,942
Nope. I don't know.

1075
01:02:51,942 --> 01:02:53,770
- I don't know.
- Is it?

1076
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:54,814
No.
- No, it's not.

1077
01:02:54,814 --> 01:02:57,338
I think a cream
pie is when they,

1078
01:02:57,338 --> 01:03:01,255
you fuck 'em in the rear, then
you pull out, and then you...

1079
01:03:01,255 --> 01:03:02,691
No?

1080
01:03:02,691 --> 01:03:05,738
Oh, I thought a cream pie
was when you come inside

1081
01:03:05,738 --> 01:03:07,435
and then suck it out.

1082
01:03:07,435 --> 01:03:09,437
Then why would you
think it was the--

1083
01:03:09,437 --> 01:03:12,266
I don't know. It's what
came out of my mouth.

1084
01:03:12,266 --> 01:03:13,790
See, look at you.

1085
01:03:14,921 --> 01:03:15,835
You're melting a little.

1086
01:03:15,835 --> 01:03:17,881
See, there you go.
- Good.

1087
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:20,013
Ah, you don't hate me.

1088
01:03:20,013 --> 01:03:21,798
You love me.
- Don't push it.

1089
01:03:23,974 --> 01:03:25,889
You know how I
feel about that.

1090
01:03:25,889 --> 01:03:26,846
I feel huge.

1091
01:03:26,846 --> 01:03:27,934
You still love me like this?

1092
01:03:27,934 --> 01:03:29,066
Yeah.

1093
01:03:29,066 --> 01:03:33,113
Well, now, maybe [indistinct].

1094
01:03:33,113 --> 01:03:34,114
Shut up.

1095
01:03:36,856 --> 01:03:38,292
But I love you, baby.

1096
01:03:38,292 --> 01:03:40,294
I love you, too.

1097
01:03:40,294 --> 01:03:42,819
Hey, real quick, I'm gonna
make this run, all right?

1098
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:45,038
I'm not going back to
jail, I promise you that.

1099
01:03:45,038 --> 01:03:46,518
I promise you that, honey.

1100
01:03:46,518 --> 01:03:47,606
How
are you gonna promise me that?

1101
01:03:47,606 --> 01:03:48,912
I'm not going back
to jail, just...

1102
01:03:48,912 --> 01:03:50,435
Are you the law?

1103
01:03:50,435 --> 01:03:52,829
Fuck
the law, all right?

1104
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:55,483
What good did the
law ever do for us?

1105
01:03:55,483 --> 01:03:56,920
- Nothin'.
- Okay then.

1106
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,399
Okay then.

1107
01:03:58,399 --> 01:04:02,360
If the law ain't never did
shit for us, fuck the law.

1108
01:04:05,319 --> 01:04:07,321
<i>Michael Crawford, 340.</i>

1109
01:04:07,321 --> 01:04:09,106
<i>Michael Crawford,
please call 340.</i>

1110
01:04:09,106 --> 01:04:10,063
Excuse me.

1111
01:04:11,369 --> 01:04:14,502
<i>Team to ICU, please. 17.</i>

1112
01:04:14,502 --> 01:04:18,332
<i>Michael Crawford, 340.</i>

1113
01:04:20,030 --> 01:04:22,859
Willy. Remember me?

1114
01:04:23,729 --> 01:04:24,730
Hey.

1115
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:25,992
What about this guy?

1116
01:04:27,994 --> 01:04:30,040
Hey, baby. Hey.

1117
01:04:31,519 --> 01:04:35,523
Oh.
Thank you so much.

1118
01:04:35,523 --> 01:04:37,090
Thank you.
- Here's my number.

1119
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:39,005
I'll watch him
until you recover.

1120
01:04:39,005 --> 01:04:40,485
Come on.

1121
01:04:40,485 --> 01:04:41,921
So you have to recover.

1122
01:04:43,836 --> 01:04:45,533
Take care of yourself.

1123
01:04:45,533 --> 01:04:46,752
Thank you.

1124
01:04:46,752 --> 01:04:48,885
Okay, Mr. Willy,
it's time for your...

1125
01:04:49,755 --> 01:04:50,843
What is this?

1126
01:04:50,843 --> 01:04:52,584
Animals are prohibited
in the hospital.

1127
01:04:52,584 --> 01:04:54,325
It's all good.
We were just leavin'.

1128
01:04:54,325 --> 01:04:55,935
- Okay.
- Take care.

1129
01:04:55,935 --> 01:04:58,155
- Go on boy. Go on, Tango.
- Come on, buddy.

1130
01:04:58,155 --> 01:04:59,547
Yeah.

1131
01:05:02,028 --> 01:05:04,335
Again, thank you so much.

1132
01:05:16,173 --> 01:05:17,739
Oh my...

1133
01:05:23,789 --> 01:05:25,573
I'm not going back to jail.

1134
01:05:36,758 --> 01:05:40,937
Run a New
York plate. JEC8522.

1135
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:43,069
It's all good, it's
all good, it's all good.

1136
01:05:43,069 --> 01:05:46,029
It's all good. I got this
handled, all right? Okay?

1137
01:05:46,029 --> 01:05:47,421
- Okay.
- Okay.

1138
01:05:49,206 --> 01:05:52,296
Okay, Central, show
12 Squad at a car stop

1139
01:05:52,296 --> 01:05:54,820
on 12th and West 29th.

1140
01:06:07,137 --> 01:06:08,355
They're coming.

1141
01:06:08,355 --> 01:06:10,140
There you go. Chill, chill.
Just relax.

1142
01:06:29,463 --> 01:06:30,812
How you doin'?

1143
01:06:30,812 --> 01:06:32,945
All right, Officer,
how you doin'?

1144
01:06:32,945 --> 01:06:34,816
License and
registration, please.

1145
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:56,490
Know why I pulled you over?

1146
01:06:56,490 --> 01:06:57,839
No. Why?

1147
01:06:57,839 --> 01:07:00,146
Stop sign back there.
You didn't see that?

1148
01:07:01,887 --> 01:07:03,149
Oh shit. For real?

1149
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,195
Nah, I didn't see it.

1150
01:07:06,109 --> 01:07:08,241
Congratulations.
How far along are you?

1151
01:07:09,068 --> 01:07:10,026
Very.

1152
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:13,377
I saw you two earlier.

1153
01:07:15,422 --> 01:07:16,728
For real?

1154
01:07:16,728 --> 01:07:19,035
It's a little dangerous
to be driving like this.

1155
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:21,733
Just being
curious, what was I wearing?

1156
01:07:23,082 --> 01:07:24,562
A wise guy, huh?

1157
01:07:24,562 --> 01:07:25,563
Nah.

1158
01:07:26,259 --> 01:07:27,260
Nah.

1159
01:07:28,783 --> 01:07:29,871
What do you think?
Your license in there, pal?

1160
01:07:29,871 --> 01:07:31,786
Man, I put all
kinds of shit in here.

1161
01:07:32,439 --> 01:07:33,571
Gun!

1162
01:07:34,224 --> 01:07:36,748
Hey,
stop it!

1163
01:07:37,227 --> 01:07:38,706
No, let him go!

1164
01:07:38,706 --> 01:07:42,797
Lemme see your hands!
Let me see your hands.

1165
01:07:44,234 --> 01:07:45,800
Fuck off me, man.

1166
01:07:47,585 --> 01:07:51,415
Get outta the car,
slowly. Let's go.

1167
01:07:56,507 --> 01:07:58,552
Turn around, put your
hands on the hood.

1168
01:08:01,729 --> 01:08:03,383
Let's go, asshole.

1169
01:08:26,276 --> 01:08:28,278
Two pounds of sweet
tarts in the trunk.

1170
01:08:28,278 --> 01:08:30,715
Oh [chuckles], the DA's
gonna love this one.

1171
01:08:31,629 --> 01:08:33,370
Look Frank, I got
a dog in the car.

1172
01:08:33,370 --> 01:08:34,458
Do you mind if...

1173
01:08:35,589 --> 01:08:37,809
Go ahead, Deo.
We'll process it.

1174
01:08:37,809 --> 01:08:39,419
Thanks for picking up
my bag of shit, Frank.

1175
01:08:39,419 --> 01:08:41,421
- No problem.
- Appreciate you.

1176
01:08:42,161 --> 01:08:44,468
Hey! You drive.

1177
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:49,864
Wait.

1178
01:08:52,954 --> 01:08:53,868
Thanks.

1179
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:02,138
Aww.

1180
01:09:03,748 --> 01:09:05,793
Oh, thank you.
I just got kissed.

1181
01:09:05,793 --> 01:09:07,404
You know, I could probably
drop you guys first

1182
01:09:07,404 --> 01:09:08,492
so everybody doesn't know

1183
01:09:08,492 --> 01:09:10,972
that we're the new
parents of a dog.

1184
01:09:10,972 --> 01:09:12,800
He's been in here for a while.

1185
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:15,629
Maybe we should take him to the
park first, give him a walk.

1186
01:09:15,629 --> 01:09:16,674
Sounds good.

1187
01:09:18,632 --> 01:09:19,633
What a day.

1188
01:09:20,939 --> 01:09:22,984
What a fuckin' day.

1189
01:09:41,046 --> 01:09:43,483
Wait, wait, wait. Okay, come on.

1190
01:09:44,528 --> 01:09:45,703
Come here.

1191
01:09:46,660 --> 01:09:48,009
Okay, go ahead.

1192
01:09:51,883 --> 01:09:53,319
You think we should get him?

1193
01:09:53,319 --> 01:09:55,016
I think you should get him.

1194
01:09:56,975 --> 01:09:58,019
- Right.
- Yeah.

1195
01:10:16,386 --> 01:10:18,344
<i>I failed, Sissy.</i>

1196
01:10:18,953 --> 01:10:19,867
Paul?

1197
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:21,521
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

1198
01:10:22,305 --> 01:10:23,262
I'm so sorry.

1199
01:10:24,394 --> 01:10:26,265
Slow down. What's goin' on?

1200
01:10:26,265 --> 01:10:28,049
She said she was gonna leave.

1201
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:37,929
This is your idea, isn't it?

1202
01:10:37,929 --> 01:10:39,670
Get away from me.
You're not my dad!

1203
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:41,280
We're leaving today.

1204
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:43,630
Oh, you're leaving today.
You think you're leaving, huh?

1205
01:10:43,630 --> 01:10:48,026
I give you clothes to wear,
I give you food to eat.

1206
01:10:48,026 --> 01:10:50,898
And this is how you repay
me, you little shit?

1207
01:10:50,898 --> 01:10:53,336
Huh? You're leavin' me?

1208
01:10:53,336 --> 01:10:55,816
Nobody's, nobody's,
nobody's leavin'.

1209
01:10:55,816 --> 01:10:57,078
You understand?
Leavin' me?

1210
01:11:00,778 --> 01:11:03,433
No. Nobody leaves me!
You're shit.

1211
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:08,742
Nobody, nobody's leaving me!

1212
01:11:30,547 --> 01:11:32,288
Paul, what the
fuck is happening?

1213
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:34,202
Paul?

1214
01:11:38,468 --> 01:11:39,425
Fuck.

1215
01:11:47,346 --> 01:11:48,695
It's my brother.

1216
01:11:51,481 --> 01:11:53,134
Okay, get in. I'll drive.

1217
01:11:58,357 --> 01:11:59,445
Where we goin'?

1218
01:11:59,445 --> 01:12:00,794
I'm trying
to find it now.

1219
01:12:00,794 --> 01:12:02,318
I know it's in Queens.

1220
01:12:03,667 --> 01:12:05,321
What the fuck did you do?

1221
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:07,801
What the fuck did you
fucking do?

1222
01:12:09,455 --> 01:12:10,804
Can you tell
me what's goin' on?

1223
01:12:10,804 --> 01:12:12,328
It's my brother.

1224
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:13,807
Apparently his girlfriend
wants to leave him.

1225
01:12:13,807 --> 01:12:15,156
Look, he's not well.

1226
01:12:15,156 --> 01:12:17,245
He began using to
cope with the PTSD

1227
01:12:17,245 --> 01:12:19,422
when he got back from
two tours in Iraq.

1228
01:12:19,422 --> 01:12:22,816
He was clean for a long
time, so I thought.

1229
01:12:22,816 --> 01:12:24,688
I'm pretty sure
he is using again,

1230
01:12:24,688 --> 01:12:26,733
and when he does,
it's really bad.

1231
01:12:28,387 --> 01:12:31,651
Paul?

1232
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:42,749
I love you.

1233
01:12:47,798 --> 01:12:49,147
All right,
we're almost there.

1234
01:12:49,147 --> 01:12:50,931
Turn right. Turn right here.

1235
01:12:50,931 --> 01:12:53,194
And it says about 800
feet on the right side.

1236
01:12:53,194 --> 01:12:55,022
Yeah, yeah, this
complex. Unit 404.

1237
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:04,031
Door's open.

1238
01:13:05,119 --> 01:13:07,252
You let me go in first.

1239
01:13:15,434 --> 01:13:16,392
Paulie?

1240
01:13:18,306 --> 01:13:19,264
Paulie?

1241
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:20,961
Oh.

1242
01:13:21,571 --> 01:13:22,572
Paulie?

1243
01:15:40,710 --> 01:15:42,799
Boss, we ain't
do nothin' wrong.

1244
01:15:42,799 --> 01:15:43,843
You didn't
do nothin' right.

1245
01:15:43,843 --> 01:15:45,845
What did you expect us to do?

1246
01:15:45,845 --> 01:15:49,806
Jackie, Jackie, Jackie.
What are the rules, Jackie?

1247
01:15:49,806 --> 01:15:53,549
No women, and above
all, no fuckin' kids.

1248
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,855
I sent you there to intimidate

1249
01:15:55,855 --> 01:15:59,163
and persuade Logan to
givin' up the goods.

1250
01:15:59,163 --> 01:16:01,034
I didn't tell you
to fuckin' kill him.

1251
01:16:01,034 --> 01:16:03,559
How am I supposed to get
paid back if he's dead?

1252
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:05,561
He sold the goods.

1253
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:07,650
He sold 'em. He made
a fuckin' profit.

1254
01:16:07,650 --> 01:16:10,000
The fuck was I supposed
to do, let him rip us off?

1255
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,873
What you were supposed to
do is maybe break his fingers.

1256
01:16:13,873 --> 01:16:15,571
How about chop off a thumb?

1257
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:18,748
But you gotta go to the
extreme? Kill his fuckin' kid?

1258
01:16:18,748 --> 01:16:19,879
The shit was gone.

1259
01:16:19,879 --> 01:16:21,272
What the fuck were we gonna do?

1260
01:16:21,272 --> 01:16:24,754
The biggest problem we
have is you two douchebags

1261
01:16:24,754 --> 01:16:27,887
got caught on the
security cameras.

1262
01:16:27,887 --> 01:16:30,629
So now the security
company has your footage,

1263
01:16:31,674 --> 01:16:34,764
which means the
cops have it also.

1264
01:16:34,764 --> 01:16:38,898
And my bet is that you
are both not willing

1265
01:16:38,898 --> 01:16:42,510
to do 25 to life for
killin' that kid.

1266
01:16:42,510 --> 01:16:45,078
Which means to me
that you're gonna sing

1267
01:16:45,078 --> 01:16:47,603
like the little canaries
that youse both are.

1268
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:48,734
No, no, Boss, we
would never do that.

1269
01:16:48,734 --> 01:16:50,214
That's right, you will never.

1270
01:17:10,756 --> 01:17:12,584
Clean up this
fuckin' mess, all right?

1271
01:17:12,584 --> 01:17:13,890
The sight of blood,

1272
01:17:13,890 --> 01:17:15,761
kinda makes me feel
a little hungry.

1273
01:17:15,761 --> 01:17:17,110
Do a nice job,

1274
01:17:17,110 --> 01:17:18,982
maybe go out and have a
couple of steaks, huh?

1275
01:17:23,508 --> 01:17:25,466
Did he just say
what I think he said?

1276
01:17:26,990 --> 01:17:30,297
He said hurry up and
clean up this mess.

1277
01:17:30,558 --> 01:17:32,778
When he see the
blood, he get hungry.

1278
01:17:32,778 --> 01:17:34,301
He gonna take us for steak.

1279
01:17:56,802 --> 01:17:57,977
Fuck you, Paul.

1280
01:17:59,457 --> 01:18:01,024
Is there someone
I should call?

1281
01:18:01,981 --> 01:18:05,376
Why do men always feel like
they have to fix everything?

1282
01:18:05,376 --> 01:18:06,420
It's our nature.

1283
01:18:09,989 --> 01:18:11,556
Your parents still alive?

1284
01:18:13,819 --> 01:18:17,344
Mm, look at that.
We're both orphans.

1285
01:18:19,216 --> 01:18:20,217
How'd they die?

1286
01:18:24,743 --> 01:18:27,485
Okay, you know what you could
do? You could talk to me.

1287
01:18:27,485 --> 01:18:28,878
You could talk to
me about anything

1288
01:18:28,878 --> 01:18:31,010
other than what the fuck
I'm feeling right now.

1289
01:18:31,010 --> 01:18:32,098
How about that?

1290
01:18:33,056 --> 01:18:35,841
You know what?
We're gonna play a game.

1291
01:18:35,841 --> 01:18:37,625
I'm not much of a games guy.

1292
01:18:38,844 --> 01:18:40,150
I wasn't asking.

1293
01:18:40,150 --> 01:18:41,673
I'm gonna ask you questions

1294
01:18:41,673 --> 01:18:43,762
and you're gonna
answer them honestly.

1295
01:18:43,762 --> 01:18:46,852
And if you don't, you
have to take a shot, okay?

1296
01:18:48,027 --> 01:18:49,768
My dad died when I was 19.

1297
01:18:51,639 --> 01:18:52,597
How?

1298
01:18:53,424 --> 01:18:57,254
Stabbed. Prison, all right?

1299
01:18:57,254 --> 01:18:58,342
He was a criminal.

1300
01:18:59,082 --> 01:19:02,389
Hmm, so you went
the other way. Nice.

1301
01:19:02,389 --> 01:19:03,826
What about your mother?

1302
01:19:03,826 --> 01:19:07,220
Good woman.
Passed three years ago.

1303
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:08,744
- How?
- Life.

1304
01:19:10,049 --> 01:19:10,963
Hmm.

1305
01:19:11,921 --> 01:19:13,270
It eventually kills you.

1306
01:19:14,924 --> 01:19:17,753
My dad died in
combat, Afghanistan.

1307
01:19:18,841 --> 01:19:21,408
My mother drank herself
to death after that.

1308
01:19:21,408 --> 01:19:24,890
And Paul, well, he just
went a little crazy.

1309
01:19:27,850 --> 01:19:29,199
And you know when
everything around you

1310
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:31,027
just starts to fall apart,

1311
01:19:31,027 --> 01:19:34,247
it feels like, the
only thing you can do

1312
01:19:34,247 --> 01:19:36,249
is just grab the
wheel and hold on.

1313
01:19:41,472 --> 01:19:42,778
Why'd you get divorced?

1314
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:45,911
You should crash here tonight.

1315
01:19:47,913 --> 01:19:49,306
Just answer the question.

1316
01:19:51,308 --> 01:19:52,352
I was a jerk.

1317
01:19:53,919 --> 01:19:54,920
Why?

1318
01:20:10,327 --> 01:20:11,850
I caught her
with someone else.

1319
01:20:12,982 --> 01:20:15,811
Like red-handed?
What did that look like?

1320
01:20:18,291 --> 01:20:21,512
Ooh. So why'd she cheat?

1321
01:20:22,905 --> 01:20:24,732
I was inadequate.

1322
01:20:24,732 --> 01:20:27,823
Bullshit. Why'd she cheat?

1323
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:30,173
- We grew apart.
- Why?

1324
01:20:30,173 --> 01:20:31,827
Because I wasn't around.

1325
01:20:32,479 --> 01:20:33,654
Why?

1326
01:20:33,654 --> 01:20:36,483
Threw myself into
my work, or escaped,

1327
01:20:36,483 --> 01:20:38,311
whatever you wanna call it.

1328
01:20:38,311 --> 01:20:41,619
I was never present, and when
I was, I was mostly drunk.

1329
01:20:41,619 --> 01:20:42,663
There.

1330
01:20:46,537 --> 01:20:47,494
Why?

1331
01:20:52,673 --> 01:20:53,849
We had a daughter.

1332
01:20:57,983 --> 01:20:58,897
Ava.

1333
01:21:00,333 --> 01:21:03,902
Ava Marie. She was only
supposed to live one year.

1334
01:21:07,036 --> 01:21:08,907
She made it 18 months.

1335
01:21:11,214 --> 01:21:12,868
Congenital heart disease.

1336
01:21:15,783 --> 01:21:16,872
I guess after that,

1337
01:21:19,483 --> 01:21:24,444
it just got hard to find
peace amidst the chaos.

1338
01:21:39,155 --> 01:21:40,199
Sorry.

1339
01:21:42,941 --> 01:21:44,247
Me too.

1340
01:21:47,467 --> 01:21:48,468
What a day.

1341
01:21:51,645 --> 01:21:53,299
What a fuckin' day.

1342
01:21:57,390 --> 01:22:02,091
You should take the bedroom.
I'll take the couch.

1343
01:22:02,091 --> 01:22:04,049
You don't have to do that.

1344
01:22:04,049 --> 01:22:05,137
Yes I do.

1345
01:22:08,271 --> 01:22:09,925
Thanks, partner.

1346
01:22:10,273 --> 01:22:13,450
I'll get you some towels
and, ya know, whatever.

1347
01:22:39,563 --> 01:22:41,304
Who's that? Who's that?

1348
01:22:41,826 --> 01:22:43,654
Who's that?
- Hey, Tango!

1349
01:22:43,654 --> 01:22:45,961
Tango, my good boy. Come here.

1350
01:22:46,657 --> 01:22:47,658
Hey.

1351
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:52,968
I cannot thank you enough.

1352
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:54,621
No, no, get that outta here.

1353
01:22:54,621 --> 01:22:57,102
Come on, no. Absolutely not.

1354
01:22:57,102 --> 01:22:58,843
But I'll give you this back.

1355
01:22:58,843 --> 01:23:01,106
This 75-pound ball of joy.

1356
01:23:01,106 --> 01:23:03,239
Okay. Thank you.

1357
01:23:03,239 --> 01:23:06,372
I just, ah, I just
have one request.

1358
01:23:07,112 --> 01:23:09,985
Let me walk him
from time to time?

1359
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:12,813
He's been, ah, he's been good
for me the last few weeks.

1360
01:23:12,813 --> 01:23:14,293
Anytime you want.

1361
01:23:17,514 --> 01:23:21,909
You know, when I was laying
there and nearly dying,

1362
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:23,868
the only thing I thought about

1363
01:23:23,868 --> 01:23:26,392
was what would happen to Tango.

1364
01:23:28,307 --> 01:23:30,135
So, I had to survive.

1365
01:23:30,135 --> 01:23:32,529
I couldn't leave
without knowing.

1366
01:23:32,529 --> 01:23:36,837
When you came back with
him, I knew he'd be okay.

1367
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:40,885
Everybody needs to
live for somebody

1368
01:23:40,885 --> 01:23:43,714
or something outside
of themselves.

1369
01:23:49,850 --> 01:23:51,243
Thank you.

1370
01:23:53,506 --> 01:23:54,899
That's my ride.

1371
01:23:56,944 --> 01:23:58,120
All right, this isn't goodbye.

1372
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:00,861
This is just a see
ya later, yeah?

1373
01:24:00,861 --> 01:24:03,821
Appreciate it.
Thank you so much.

1374
01:24:03,821 --> 01:24:05,040
Yeah, say goodbye, Tango.

1375
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,346
Say goodbye. Let's
go this way, baby.

1376
01:24:07,346 --> 01:24:08,913
Come on. Come on.

1377
01:24:09,392 --> 01:24:10,436
Why are you filmin' me?

1378
01:24:10,436 --> 01:24:11,785
Come on, no one
wants to see this.

1379
01:24:11,785 --> 01:24:13,135
Hey, you're the
one that told me dogs

1380
01:24:13,135 --> 01:24:16,181
bring followers, and cops.

1381
01:24:16,181 --> 01:24:20,403
Even cops with 40-year-old
asses.

1382
01:24:24,885 --> 01:24:26,713
Remember those contract
killers from a few weeks back

1383
01:24:26,713 --> 01:24:28,454
that killed the father and son?

1384
01:24:29,890 --> 01:24:31,196
Yeah.

1385
01:24:31,196 --> 01:24:33,894
We found 'em, chopped
into tiny little bits

1386
01:24:33,894 --> 01:24:35,070
in a garbage dump.

1387
01:24:36,723 --> 01:24:37,985
All right.

1388
01:24:37,985 --> 01:24:39,596
So that's where we're headed.

1389
01:24:40,553 --> 01:24:41,467
Wait.

1390
01:24:44,949 --> 01:24:46,255
Coffee and a bagel first.

1391
01:24:47,778 --> 01:24:49,562
You got it, partner.

1392
01:25:15,675 --> 01:25:16,937
Thanks for stopping.

1393
01:25:18,243 --> 01:25:19,462
Today's her birthday.

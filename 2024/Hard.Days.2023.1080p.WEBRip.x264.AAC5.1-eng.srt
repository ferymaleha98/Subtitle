3
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:02,458
Yeah?

4
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:03,958
Where are you now?

5
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:06,375
I told you, I'm on my way!

6
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:09,083
What's with the attitude?
Your mother doesn't have long.

7
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:10,708
I know!

8
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:12,250
How long will you be?

9
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:15,250
Almost there. I'm hurrying, okay?

10
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:17,041
Have you been drinking again?

11
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:18,625
What? No.

12
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:23,500
-Please don't. Not at a time like this.
-I haven't drunk anything. Not a drop!

13
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:25,666
Daddy, are you coming soon?

14
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,333
Hey, Mina. I'll be there soon. Just wait.

15
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:30,958
I'll call you back.

16
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:32,333
Hey, wait--

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,958
Yes?

18
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:36,083
Well, Kudo?

19
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:38,458
Where are you now?

20
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:40,333
Huh? Why?

21
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:42,125
We just heard from HQ.

22
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:47,250
The tabloids are going to write about
our station taking bribes.

23
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,083
What?

24
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:52,375
Have you met with
the Senba group recently?

25
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:55,583
Yeah, I met them.

26
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:57,625
Did they give you much?

27
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,291
-Wellâ€¦
-I'm asking what they gave you.

28
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:04,166
I only did it because you said so, Chief.

29
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,083
So it's you.

30
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,416
That's why they're on to us.

31
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:11,916
But obviously, we won't allow it
to get out, right?

32
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:13,541
I don't know.

33
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,416
I mean, this is all on you.

34
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,916
Wait a moment.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,791
It's not just me! Chief, you also--

36
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:21,000
An inspector from HQ
will come to our station.

37
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,333
Wait, it's not just me.

38
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:24,375
You can't just put everything on me!

39
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,333
Hey, Chief! Hey!

40
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,541
Shit! Goddamn it.

41
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:32,500
I told you, I'm on my way!

42
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:33,416
Your mother,

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,250
she just passed away.

44
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:39,625
Come quickly.

45
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:44,875
Shit.

46
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,625
Shit!

47
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:42,666
Hey.

48
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,416
Hey!

49
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,500
Why?

50
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,291
Why did all this happen?

51
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,875
MISAKO

52
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,291
Bloody hell!

53
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:46,875
Shit.

54
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:48,666
Shit!

55
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,208
Shit.

56
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:24,625
MISAKO

57
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:27,666
Shit.

58
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,166
Are you serious?

59
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:47,583
Good evening.

60
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,666
We're taking sobriety tests.

61
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,958
Keep up the good work.

62
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,125
Please blow here.

63
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:53,541
No, I'm good, thanks.

64
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,625
-I'm Kudo from Aihara station.
-Oh, sir.

65
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,791
A busy end of year for you all. See you.

66
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:02,708
Oh?

67
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,791
Look, it's Mr. Kudo.

68
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,666
Hey, it's Detective Kudo.

69
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:10,791
Thanks for your work.

70
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:11,875
Well,

71
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:14,458
the year's nearly over already.

72
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,416
How's your year been, Mr. Kudo?

73
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,666
Blow into it, please.

74
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,875
-I don't need to do that.
-Please blow.

75
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:22,000
Don't ask a colleague to do that.

76
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,958
Been drinking with girls at some bar?

77
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,041
You're joking.

78
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:26,791
As if.

79
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:27,791
Please blow.

80
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:33,333
Okay, I did drink.

81
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,875
Just a social drink. That's all.

82
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:38,708
Look, we're both police. Give me a break.

83
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:42,500
Mr. Kudo.

84
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,000
This is good timing.
Get out so we can chat.

85
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,750
Listen, I'm in a rush!

86
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:53,958
What's that?

87
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,875
It's nothing.

88
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,500
-What happened?
-Nothing.

89
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,541
-Really?
-It's nothing, I said.

90
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:01,708
What happened here?

91
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,333
I bumped into something.

92
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,666
-Was it an accident?
-Just a bump. Nothing major.

93
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,833
-What?
-Okay, fine!

94
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,958
You want me to get out, right?

95
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:21,958
Mr. Kudo.

96
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,333
You've overstepped.

97
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,875
Everyone knows you accepted Senba bribes.

98
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:33,916
Now you've had an accident.
Sorry, but we have to inspect your car.

99
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,291
That's going too far.

100
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,000
Hey, wait a minute!

101
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,375
Give me a break. I need to go!

102
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:45,708
Your phone's ringing.

103
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:46,833
That's not mine.

104
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,291
-Must be yours.
-That's not my ringtone.

105
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,333
What?

106
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,000
Wait a minute.

107
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,375
Wait!

108
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,958
Well, I just stuffed everything in there.

109
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,041
Whose is it?

110
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,166
-You said there's nothing in there.
-Exactly.

111
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,583
Let's open the trunk.

112
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,041
Hey, wait a minute!

113
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,708
Wait! I told you not to open it!

114
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:23,833
-Open it.
-Hey!

115
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,041
What the hell?

116
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,500
What's got into you?

117
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,666
What's this prick doing?

118
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,583
What the hell are you doing?

119
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,916
-Stop!
-Be still!

120
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,958
Stay still! Don't move!

121
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,250
Did something happen?

122
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,166
-Not your concern.
-Back to your car.

123
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,208
I'm Yazaki from the regional police HQ.

124
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,166
Are you okay?

125
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,125
What are you fighting about?

126
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,125
Evening, sir.

127
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:19,708
I'm Kaji from the traffic division
at Aihara station.

128
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:22,083
Detective Kudo from the same station.

129
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:24,750
Detective?

130
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,333
You're a detective from Aihara station?

131
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:33,291
Mr. Kudo,
I'm an Internal Affairs inspector.

132
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:37,458
Inspector?

133
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:38,875
Yeah. Perfect timing.

134
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,875
I'm on my way to your station now.
We've already been in touch.

135
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,333
Would you come with me?

136
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,416
I'm really sorry.

137
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,500
-What is it?
-My mother just died.

138
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,583
I'm hurrying to the hospital right now.

139
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,333
I planned to go to the station after that.

140
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:04,666
I see.

141
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,500
So you'll come to the station after?

142
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,208
Yes, I will.

143
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,416
Okay. I'll see you then.

144
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:22,416
Thank you.

145
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,250
Bloody hell.

146
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,583
AIHARA CENTRAL HOSPITAL

147
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,000
I was like, "Where did it go?"
And I looked up.

148
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,958
-A hawk was there.
-Whoa.

149
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:20,083
That's why you need to be really careful.

150
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:27,541
-Daddy!
-Mina.

151
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,333
Mina.

152
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,083
May I move her?

153
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,250
Oh, yeah.

154
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,208
Pardon me.

155
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,333
They have to move your mother right away.

156
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:00,500
Move her?

157
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:04,583
Yes. I'm very sorry,
but the hospital is not a morgue.

158
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:05,958
Yeah, but right away?

159
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,083
-Come on.
-I know.

160
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:14,541
What was it again?

161
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,208
Mr. Kudo, have you decided
on a funeral home?

162
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,125
Funeral home?

163
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:26,833
If you haven't chosen yet,
there's a company we use often.

164
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:28,791
I can contact them if you'd like.

165
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:29,875
Please.

166
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:32,125
We will be happy to arrange it.

167
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,333
No good. He's not picking up.

168
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,333
What the hell is he up to?

169
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,958
I'm Yazaki from Internal Affairs.

170
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,041
Thanks for coming.

171
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,333
Yes, especially this time of year.

172
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,416
Of course.

173
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,791
Congratulations on your marriage.

174
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,625
I'm not sure where the rumors came from.

175
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:07,041
It's not like you can accept bribes
these days when compliance is so strict.

176
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:12,708
I'll need accounts for the last decade
to check for any inappropriate expenses.

177
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,916
-Prepare them by tomorrow.
-Of course.

178
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,791
Also, there's a detective
named Kudo working here, right?

179
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:23,041
That's right. Is there something up?

180
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,791
I would like to talk to him.

181
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,500
I actually met him on the way here.

182
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,958
He said his mother just passed away.

183
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,500
I see.

184
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,875
So you hadn't been contacted yet.

185
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,458
Apparently, he was
rushing to the hospital.

186
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:42,083
He said he'd come here afterward,
so I'll wait for him here.

187
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:45,000
Oh, so that's why.

188
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:48,250
So is it something Kudo did?

189
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,708
Just something I need
to speak to him about.

190
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:06,083
Is the Kudo family there?

191
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,125
Yes.

192
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,333
Sorry to keep you waiting.

193
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:14,458
My name is Takehara from Heartful Aihara.

194
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,208
You have my deepest condolences.

195
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:27,666
We received your telephone inquiry
regarding your mother's resting place.

196
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,708
How about our own Aihara Hall?

197
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,041
If you choose our--

198
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:33,958
Sorry.

199
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,583
-Come on!
-Yep.

200
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:40,041
Kudo, did your mother pass away?

201
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:43,166
Yes. I'm at the hospital right now.

202
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,666
You said you'd come
to the station after, right?

203
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:49,916
Who did you hear that from?

204
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,208
The inspector is here.
He's waiting for you.

205
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,083
When are you coming?

206
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:04,750
First, we'll move her to Aihara Hallâ€¦

207
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:08,208
Aihara Hall! Sounds good. Let's do that.

208
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:12,125
I have to move my mother's body
to the venue now, so today will be tricky.

209
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:15,458
-Kudo, what are you doing?
-I'll be at the station in the morning.

210
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,666
-Sorry about that. Thanks a lot.
-Kudo!

211
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,375
I'm sorry. That was Kudo.

212
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,416
He can't come tonight
because of the funeral preparations.

213
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,500
He said he'll come tomorrow morning.

214
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:50,708
I see.

215
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:52,666
Tomorrow morning.

216
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,083
Yes.

217
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:57,458
I understand.

218
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,958
Until tomorrow, then.

219
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,583
This is bad.

220
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,125
Today we will keep your mother
in the mortuary.

221
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:25,750
Thank you.

222
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,416
We're going home.
We'll come again tomorrow.

223
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,416
You'll help with the funeral too?

224
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:51,958
I have to, right?

225
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,291
We're still "family," for now.

226
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,541
Get that thing to me soon, okay?

227
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:03,500
Yes, I know.

228
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,083
-Yes?
-Where are you now?

229
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:44,875
Now? Aihara Hall.

230
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:45,833
Right.

231
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,250
We'll be there soon. Wait at the entrance.

232
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,000
We need to agree on a story
about the bribes.

233
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,500
Wait a minute!

234
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:55,166
Can't we wait until tomorrow?

235
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,166
We're arriving now. Come outside.

236
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,083
That's it there.

237
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:20,541
Right.

238
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:36,250
Shit.

239
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,166
Hey!

240
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:43,958
Are you okay?

241
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,458
Totally fine.

242
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:49,000
Sorry to hear about your mother.

243
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,500
Thanks. What's this about the inspector?

244
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:55,833
The inspector wants
to speak to you tomorrow.

245
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,708
Come to the station first thing.

246
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,958
Maybe they know about
your dealings with Senba.

247
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:03,500
The boss was just
a customer at my mother's place.

248
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:04,666
That's enough.

249
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,291
Wait a second, Chief.

250
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,916
It's not just me
who received bribes, right?

251
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,875
-The leak was about something recent.
-But it goes way back, right?

252
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,000
What did you do with the money you got?

253
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:18,875
Chief.

254
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,250
Just heard from Kaji in traffic.

255
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,375
Heyâ€¦

256
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:25,708
Kudo was stopped at an inspection point
and didn't show them what was in his car.

257
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,333
What?

258
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:31,166
Better not be anything illegal in there.

259
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,666
Of course there isn't!

260
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:36,583
He drove away without being checked,
saying his mother had just died.

261
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,166
Come on, don't be ridiculous!

262
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,208
The traffic divisionâ€¦

263
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,083
They just started accusing me.

264
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,458
Hey. Open it.

265
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:55,541
Yes, sir.

266
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,916
Chief, my mother just died.

267
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,333
Give me a break, will you?

268
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,000
Really pisses me off.

269
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,416
Sorry I didn't believe you.

270
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,375
Calm down.

271
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:30,958
DIVORCE APPLICATION

272
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,458
Pull over to your left.

273
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:21,083
Hello.

274
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:22,666
So,

275
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:25,791
that was a red light. Didn't you notice?

276
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:32,791
Your mother died?

277
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:10,666
Bit of a dangerous place to park, no?

278
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:12,500
Well?

279
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:14,416
Stupid.

280
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,291
What?!

281
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:34,875
Excuse me. It's about Kudo.

282
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:36,500
What now?

283
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:40,166
He caused an accident somewhere,
but he's on his way.

284
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:43,500
What the hell is he doing?

285
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,625
Excuse me.

286
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:10,125
Hey!

287
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:11,458
Hurry up!

288
00:25:11,958 --> 00:25:13,375
What's with that car?

289
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:14,291
It's a rental.

290
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:16,250
Mine's being repaired.

291
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,208
Come on.

292
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:29,708
Excuse me.

293
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:38,458
Go on.

294
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:42,791
We'll leave you to it.

295
00:25:55,958 --> 00:25:59,916
Seems like you're the one
with links to the Senba group.

296
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,041
Well,

297
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:03,458
you seeâ€¦

298
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:04,416
It's okay.

299
00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:07,666
It happens.

300
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:10,125
What?

301
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:14,666
A bit of cash to turn a blind eye.
That's all it is, right?

302
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:17,416
Don't worry.

303
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:19,958
If that's it, then I'll cover it up.

304
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:25,791
In my view,

305
00:26:26,791 --> 00:26:29,666
you need people like that
in an organization.

306
00:26:30,875 --> 00:26:33,958
Many things in this world
can't be resolved "neatly."

307
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:36,875
Right.

308
00:26:38,791 --> 00:26:40,000
But, Mr. Kudoâ€¦

309
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:46,250
there's something else
you're hiding, isn't there?

310
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:51,041
Have you been dragged into something?

311
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:54,000
No.

312
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:56,791
The first thing we do in our line of work
is observe people's behavior.

313
00:26:56,875 --> 00:27:00,416
When I said I'd cover this up,
you didn't seem very relieved,

314
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,458
which means there's
some other issue, correct?

315
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,041
No, Iâ€¦

316
00:27:09,791 --> 00:27:10,666
No.

317
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,125
Mr. Kudo.

318
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,125
Please talk to me.

319
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,625
I can help you.

320
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:27,583
There's nothing, really.

321
00:27:27,666 --> 00:27:28,833
Really?

322
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,166
Yes.

323
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:40,208
I see.

324
00:27:40,708 --> 00:27:41,791
Well, I'm glad.

325
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:48,833
What's going on in there?

326
00:27:48,916 --> 00:27:50,416
They've been a while.

327
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,458
-What if he mentions you, Chief?
-Sorry to keep you waiting.

328
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,666
It's nothing that warrants
any fuss at this time of year.

329
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,500
I'll tell my superiors
there's nothing to worry about.

330
00:28:01,583 --> 00:28:03,708
I'll be off, then. Happy New Year.

331
00:28:04,541 --> 00:28:06,666
-Thanks for coming.
-Thank you.

332
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:13,458
What a relief.

333
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:20,375
What's with that guy?

334
00:28:20,458 --> 00:28:24,958
AIHARA HALL

335
00:28:34,708 --> 00:28:37,333
We will now close the coffin.

336
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:39,750
Would you like to see the face
one last time?

337
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:52,625
We will now close the coffin.

338
00:28:59,875 --> 00:29:04,166
Excuse me. It seems the ceremony
can be held at a Zenmyoji temple branch.

339
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:09,333
A funeral on New Year's Eve.

340
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:14,333
If left until the new year,
the funeral would have to be much later.

341
00:29:14,416 --> 00:29:18,000
After the funeral at Zenmyoji,

342
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:21,958
the body will be cremated
at the town crematorium.

343
00:29:24,125 --> 00:29:25,375
Crematedâ€¦

344
00:29:28,916 --> 00:29:31,083
Do you know where Zenmyoji is?

345
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:35,125
-There's a map on the other side.
-Thank you.

346
00:29:40,583 --> 00:29:43,208
Have you sent out invites
for people attending tomorrow?

347
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:55,041
Wait!

348
00:30:28,791 --> 00:30:30,541
That is wonderful to hear!

349
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:34,125
The chief mourner will keep
the wake candle burning

350
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:36,875
instead of holding an official ceremony.

351
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,750
You're going to stay here all night?

352
00:30:39,833 --> 00:30:42,791
She was a single mother,
and I was her only child.

353
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:43,791
It's nothing.

354
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:46,416
Daddy's not coming home, then?

355
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,083
Tonight Daddy's going to stay
with Grandma.

356
00:30:49,166 --> 00:30:50,625
Then I'm staying too!

357
00:30:50,708 --> 00:30:52,125
No, you can't.

358
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,958
Let Daddy take care of it tonight, okay?

359
00:30:55,958 --> 00:30:57,458
Okay, Mina, let's go.

360
00:30:58,458 --> 00:30:59,625
Don't be late tomorrow.

361
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:00,708
All right.

362
00:31:01,208 --> 00:31:02,083
Bye-bye.

363
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,833
Let's go.

364
00:33:57,916 --> 00:34:00,375
Sorry, Mom. I'm so sorry.

365
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:03,250
Sorry.

366
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:22,500
It's fine.

367
00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:27,833
Oh, Momâ€¦

368
00:34:29,875 --> 00:34:32,041
I'm so sorry.

369
00:34:38,166 --> 00:34:39,000
Excuse me.

370
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,333
Good evening.

371
00:35:14,916 --> 00:35:16,083
Yes, that's right.

372
00:35:18,541 --> 00:35:19,375
Crap!

373
00:35:32,125 --> 00:35:33,166
In here.

374
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:45,875
Why?

375
00:35:47,958 --> 00:35:49,500
It's too soon.

376
00:35:53,291 --> 00:35:54,125
Sorry.

377
00:35:54,708 --> 00:35:55,958
Thought I was alone.

378
00:35:56,041 --> 00:35:57,416
Oh, noâ€¦

379
00:35:58,041 --> 00:36:00,458
Sorry to have barged in like that.

380
00:36:00,541 --> 00:36:01,541
Sorry.

381
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:03,541
That's fine.

382
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:08,791
Weâ€¦ we've come to replace the dry ice.

383
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:11,083
The dry ice?

384
00:36:12,375 --> 00:36:14,750
The dry ice inside the coffin.

385
00:36:14,833 --> 00:36:15,666
Oh.

386
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:17,583
The dry ice.

387
00:36:18,916 --> 00:36:19,750
Well, then.

388
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:27,541
Would you let me change the dry ice?

389
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:28,541
What?

390
00:36:29,083 --> 00:36:30,791
As a final gesture for my mother.

391
00:36:32,208 --> 00:36:34,208
I want to be the one who does it.

392
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:39,791
We understand.

393
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:42,041
Please.

394
00:36:44,625 --> 00:36:45,458
There.

395
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:54,083
There's a special way--

396
00:36:54,166 --> 00:36:55,291
It's fine.

397
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:56,333
I've got this.

398
00:36:57,291 --> 00:36:58,333
Oh, right.

399
00:37:02,041 --> 00:37:03,333
-The placing--
-It's fine.

400
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:06,375
On the stomach and chest.

401
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:08,416
-On the stomach and chest.
-Yes.

402
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,375
Stomach andâ€¦

403
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:37,083
TOUCH ID OR ENTER PASSCODE

404
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:43,875
Good evening.

405
00:37:43,958 --> 00:37:46,291
Mr. Senba, why are you here?

406
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:50,791
It's not like I can come to the funeral.

407
00:37:56,083 --> 00:37:58,500
I shouldn't be meeting you right now.

408
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,666
Because some journalist
is sniffing around?

409
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,625
Let me pray for her.

410
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:14,166
Can I see her face?

411
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:22,833
It must be a weight off your shoulders.

412
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:28,916
Her medical and care costs
must have been no joke.

413
00:38:29,416 --> 00:38:31,500
I'm still in debt hell as a result.

414
00:38:33,125 --> 00:38:36,041
Kazue kept saying the same thing.

415
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:38,958
She didn't want to be stuck
in a place like this.

416
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:41,291
Her final days spent
as a barmaid in the boonies.

417
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:47,458
With a little more money,
she thought she'd live a better life.

418
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,500
Kept saying that until the end.

419
00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:52,708
Who cares.

420
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:55,583
Once you're dead, it's all over.

421
00:39:01,291 --> 00:39:04,041
There's a lizard that lives in the desert.

422
00:39:07,041 --> 00:39:07,916
Huh?

423
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:14,208
This desert is completely barren.

424
00:39:16,583 --> 00:39:20,291
During the day,
the lizard manages to stand on the sand

425
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:23,041
by hopping on its right and left leg.

426
00:39:24,583 --> 00:39:26,000
The sand is hot.

427
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:31,041
When it gets hot,
it hops to the opposite leg.

428
00:39:31,541 --> 00:39:33,666
Hopping back and forth.

429
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:39,916
It keeps its body still
and switches between legs

430
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,666
until the sun sets.

431
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,500
Better to go somewhere else, surely,

432
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,375
but it doesn't leave.

433
00:39:52,875 --> 00:39:57,000
It just keeps switching between its legs

434
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,416
from birth until death.

435
00:40:00,958 --> 00:40:02,500
What's your point?

436
00:40:06,541 --> 00:40:10,333
Do you want to get out of the desert?

437
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,333
What?

438
00:40:14,708 --> 00:40:16,625
For that, you'll need money.

439
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:20,291
An amount large enough
to change the way you live.

440
00:40:20,375 --> 00:40:23,250
Sure, and where would I find
that kind of money?

441
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:25,125
Zenmyoji.

442
00:40:27,541 --> 00:40:29,333
They're stacked to the rafters.

443
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:33,375
Zenmyoji.

444
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:37,708
We're having the funeral there tomorrow.

445
00:40:39,958 --> 00:40:45,000
Their main temple
is the biggest in this region.

446
00:40:47,166 --> 00:40:50,291
They have strong links
with politicians in central government.

447
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:53,583
High-ranking officials
make a special effort to visit.

448
00:40:55,583 --> 00:40:57,833
Why the fuss over a little rural temple?

449
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:04,833
They've been collecting large donations
from those officials.

450
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:06,500
I know.

451
00:41:07,458 --> 00:41:12,541
Apparently, all that cash
is kept in the temple's secret vault.

452
00:41:13,291 --> 00:41:14,125
That's right.

453
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:17,000
That would be fine

454
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:22,833
if they were managing it properly.

455
00:41:24,166 --> 00:41:25,000
What?

456
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:29,416
Those high-ranking officials
are using the temple

457
00:41:30,291 --> 00:41:33,416
to "purify" their dirty money.

458
00:41:37,541 --> 00:41:40,333
The temple receives a commission
for its services.

459
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:43,500
In other words, money laundering.

460
00:41:46,625 --> 00:41:47,541
Howeverâ€¦

461
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:52,708
a young guy named Oda
was supposed to guard the cash,

462
00:41:52,791 --> 00:41:54,833
but he stole some and ran away.

463
00:41:57,208 --> 00:41:58,041
How much?

464
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:01,208
Not sure, but over a hundred million.

465
00:42:05,583 --> 00:42:10,250
I know where that Oda punk is hiding.

466
00:42:13,291 --> 00:42:15,166
What are you telling me to do?

467
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:16,166
You catch him.

468
00:42:20,583 --> 00:42:25,625
Then the police follow the trail
and expose the temple,

469
00:42:25,708 --> 00:42:28,166
and I take over things.

470
00:42:29,166 --> 00:42:30,041
Interested?

471
00:42:30,125 --> 00:42:31,208
Oh man!

472
00:42:31,791 --> 00:42:34,125
My mother just died, you know.

473
00:42:34,208 --> 00:42:35,333
Be more sensitive.

474
00:42:39,041 --> 00:42:42,458
Don't you want to get out of the desert?

475
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:59,541
-Hello.
-Hey.

476
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:03,625
Look at this.

477
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:07,166
Hajime Oda, 29 years old.

478
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:09,541
He has a criminal record
for selling cannabis.

479
00:43:10,041 --> 00:43:11,625
-He's a young pup.
-Yep.

480
00:43:11,708 --> 00:43:13,500
Take a good look at his face.

481
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:32,125
That's Oda?

482
00:43:32,875 --> 00:43:34,958
Hey, do you know him?

483
00:43:36,333 --> 00:43:37,166
No.

484
00:43:37,666 --> 00:43:40,083
Hey, I got the search warrant.

485
00:43:41,083 --> 00:43:42,000
That was quick!

486
00:43:42,083 --> 00:43:44,791
It's the end of the year.
I bet you all want a break.

487
00:43:44,875 --> 00:43:46,208
Let's get this over with.

488
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:47,208
Yes, sir!

489
00:43:49,166 --> 00:43:51,000
Right, all set?

490
00:43:51,083 --> 00:43:51,958
-Yes!
-Yep!

491
00:44:00,708 --> 00:44:02,333
There it is. You can see it now.

492
00:44:02,416 --> 00:44:03,458
Oh, right.

493
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,416
Wait here, please.

494
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,958
Let's go. You guys go around.

495
00:44:34,041 --> 00:44:34,875
Sure.

496
00:44:43,666 --> 00:44:44,666
Hey, Kudo!

497
00:44:45,166 --> 00:44:46,666
Don't be so obvious!

498
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:47,583
Right.

499
00:44:48,125 --> 00:44:51,541
It just feels like he's not here.

500
00:44:51,625 --> 00:44:53,625
Why? It was your tip-off.

501
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:57,583
I've just got this feeling he's not here.

502
00:44:59,708 --> 00:45:00,833
-Come on.
-Yeah.

503
00:45:11,416 --> 00:45:12,833
-Well?
-He's not here.

504
00:45:14,416 --> 00:45:15,250
Crap.

505
00:45:16,041 --> 00:45:19,083
Looks like he left in a hurry.

506
00:45:19,166 --> 00:45:20,916
He must have known we were coming.

507
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:54,500
NEW MESSAGE

508
00:45:56,333 --> 00:45:58,833
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID

509
00:46:01,833 --> 00:46:03,500
YOU KILLED SOMEONE

510
00:46:11,958 --> 00:46:14,708
YOU KILLED ODA
YOU'RE A MURDERER

511
00:46:24,041 --> 00:46:27,125
WHO IS THIS?

512
00:46:30,375 --> 00:46:33,291
YOU CAN'T ESCAPE
I KNOW EVERYTHING

513
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:35,833
What are you doing here?

514
00:46:36,666 --> 00:46:37,583
Nothingâ€¦

515
00:46:38,416 --> 00:46:39,791
As I thought, nothing here.

516
00:46:40,625 --> 00:46:42,083
Right, yeah.

517
00:46:49,916 --> 00:46:53,375
Huh? Isn't that a security camera?

518
00:46:55,958 --> 00:46:56,791
Hey.

519
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,333
Look.

520
00:47:02,833 --> 00:47:03,833
Hey!

521
00:47:03,916 --> 00:47:04,791
-Yes?
-Yeah?

522
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,750
There's a security camera there.

523
00:47:08,833 --> 00:47:10,250
Maybe it caught something.

524
00:47:11,166 --> 00:47:14,000
Right. It could have caught Oda escaping.

525
00:47:14,083 --> 00:47:15,833
Right. Let's go and check it out.

526
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:16,875
Yes, sir.

527
00:47:17,625 --> 00:47:18,791
Excuse me.

528
00:47:18,875 --> 00:47:21,875
-Could we see footage from that camera?
-Sure.

529
00:47:23,625 --> 00:47:24,500
What the hell?

530
00:47:25,416 --> 00:47:26,833
The quality sucks.

531
00:47:27,416 --> 00:47:29,208
It's probably an old camera.

532
00:47:29,291 --> 00:47:31,041
Must have been set up ages ago.

533
00:47:34,625 --> 00:47:36,958
Isn't it your mother's funeral today?

534
00:47:37,041 --> 00:47:38,083
I've still got time.

535
00:47:38,166 --> 00:47:40,166
And? Did it show anything?

536
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:41,791
No, nothing.

537
00:47:41,875 --> 00:47:44,166
Hardly any cars or people pass by there.

538
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,416
Wait, something just passed by.

539
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:50,000
Pause it.

540
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:52,791
There.

541
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,625
-One more time.
-Okay.

542
00:48:02,708 --> 00:48:04,500
Huh? What was that?

543
00:48:04,583 --> 00:48:06,500
That car stopped abruptly.

544
00:48:07,583 --> 00:48:08,416
One more time.

545
00:48:14,333 --> 00:48:16,166
-When was this?
-Two days ago.

546
00:48:17,458 --> 00:48:18,791
It's raining pretty hard.

547
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,541
Get the car's plate.

548
00:48:21,625 --> 00:48:22,458
Sure.

549
00:48:28,708 --> 00:48:29,750
Zoom in.

550
00:48:29,833 --> 00:48:30,666
Okay.

551
00:48:31,625 --> 00:48:32,458
Zoom in more.

552
00:48:32,541 --> 00:48:33,375
Okay.

553
00:48:34,625 --> 00:48:36,250
Is that a three?

554
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:37,291
An eight?

555
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:40,000
-Eight, I think?
-That's a three.

556
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,833
-It doesn't join on the left.
-Yeah.

557
00:48:52,416 --> 00:48:54,708
Shit, I can't make it out!

558
00:48:54,791 --> 00:48:56,000
We can't go on that.

559
00:48:56,958 --> 00:48:58,458
-Damn.
-Okay, I'm going.

560
00:48:58,541 --> 00:48:59,541
I have the funeral.

561
00:49:00,208 --> 00:49:01,333
I'm the chief mourner.

562
00:49:18,875 --> 00:49:20,541
Sorry, it looks like he's arrived.

563
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:23,208
Why are you late?

564
00:49:23,291 --> 00:49:24,125
I had work.

565
00:49:24,208 --> 00:49:25,500
Hurry up!

566
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:28,125
What's with the car?

567
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,875
Where's Mina?

568
00:49:30,958 --> 00:49:32,833
Your colleague is looking after her.

569
00:49:32,916 --> 00:49:34,458
-What?
-Thank him afterward.

570
00:49:34,541 --> 00:49:35,375
Who?

571
00:49:35,458 --> 00:49:36,666
Come on, hurry!

572
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:37,583
What?

573
00:49:37,666 --> 00:49:38,833
Hurry!

574
00:49:54,125 --> 00:49:55,708
UNKNOWN CALLER

575
00:50:09,166 --> 00:50:10,000
Yeah?

576
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:13,708
You sure are calm,
considering you just killed someone.

577
00:50:15,041 --> 00:50:15,875
Right?

578
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:17,958
Who are you?

579
00:50:18,541 --> 00:50:20,083
You're finished.

580
00:50:20,958 --> 00:50:22,500
I don't know what you're talking about.

581
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,625
If it's a prank, I'm hanging up.

582
00:50:24,708 --> 00:50:26,541
Hang up and I'll report it.

583
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:32,333
I'll report the corrupt cop
who ran over Oda and disposed of the body.

584
00:50:32,916 --> 00:50:35,041
Right, Yuji Kudo?

585
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:39,625
So youâ€¦

586
00:50:41,833 --> 00:50:42,750
were watching?

587
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:45,875
Yeah, I saw everything.

588
00:50:47,458 --> 00:50:48,458
So,

589
00:50:49,583 --> 00:50:52,583
you know where I buried the body?

590
00:50:55,458 --> 00:50:57,041
Of course I know.

591
00:50:59,083 --> 00:51:00,541
You dumbass!

592
00:51:00,625 --> 00:51:03,125
I haven't buried anything!

593
00:51:03,208 --> 00:51:05,791
You haven't seen a thing, have you?

594
00:51:05,875 --> 00:51:09,583
You're just talking shit, stupid idiot!

595
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:19,083
Don't mess with me!

596
00:51:19,666 --> 00:51:21,833
You fucking brat! Think you're smart?

597
00:51:21,916 --> 00:51:23,041
Asshole!

598
00:51:30,041 --> 00:51:31,333
Oda.

599
00:51:33,166 --> 00:51:36,333
I want to know where Oda is, you bastard!

600
00:51:36,416 --> 00:51:37,625
Come on, fucker!

601
00:51:38,666 --> 00:51:41,958
I know you put the body
in the trunk, right?

602
00:51:42,916 --> 00:51:44,083
Tell me!

603
00:51:44,166 --> 00:51:45,958
Spit it out!

604
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:48,125
Where is he?

605
00:51:48,625 --> 00:51:50,208
Tell me now!

606
00:51:50,291 --> 00:51:52,041
Spit it out!

607
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:09,875
Listen carefully.

608
00:52:13,333 --> 00:52:16,708
If you don't hand him over,
your daughter will vanish.

609
00:52:18,166 --> 00:52:19,541
Bring him to me.

610
00:52:20,958 --> 00:52:22,833
At 5:00 p.m. today.

611
00:52:24,125 --> 00:52:24,958
Got it?

612
00:53:23,875 --> 00:53:25,833
You've reached voice mail.

613
00:53:26,541 --> 00:53:29,833
Please leave a message after the beep.

614
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:33,375
Press "1" to end the recording.

615
00:53:33,458 --> 00:53:38,125
Press "#" to check or change your message.

616
00:53:39,708 --> 00:53:41,250
Oda, answer your phone.

617
00:53:42,041 --> 00:53:43,666
I'll still give you a chance.

618
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:48,791
Your message has been record--

619
00:53:50,708 --> 00:53:51,875
Son of a bitch.

620
00:53:54,375 --> 00:53:55,625
That idiot Oda.

621
00:53:55,708 --> 00:53:58,958
He didn't know security required
a key card and a fingerprint.

622
00:54:00,291 --> 00:54:03,125
Even though it only opens
with your fingerprints, Yazaki.

623
00:54:11,458 --> 00:54:12,333
Sorry.

624
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:15,833
Sorry.

625
00:54:24,916 --> 00:54:27,208
So Oda ran off with the key?

626
00:54:27,708 --> 00:54:28,541
Yes.

627
00:54:29,041 --> 00:54:31,583
But he hasn't taken the money.

628
00:54:32,291 --> 00:54:34,833
-That's right.
-It's simple, then.

629
00:54:35,375 --> 00:54:38,625
Just need to catch this Oda
and get the key back, right?

630
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:39,541
Yes.

631
00:54:39,625 --> 00:54:43,166
But it must be before the end of the year.

632
00:54:44,125 --> 00:54:47,458
I promised them we'd hand over
the money at the start of the year.

633
00:54:48,083 --> 00:54:50,708
They're an important client.
You understand, right?

634
00:54:50,791 --> 00:54:52,000
I understand.

635
00:54:52,083 --> 00:54:54,333
Find him. Use the yakuza if need be.

636
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:55,250
Yes, sir.

637
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:56,583
Don't embarrass me, okay?

638
00:54:58,875 --> 00:55:02,083
You're going to be my son-in-law tomorrow.

639
00:55:04,791 --> 00:55:05,666
Yes, sir.

640
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:09,666
Also, about the bribery case
at Aihara station,

641
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:10,958
just let that lie.

642
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:14,541
Those beggars are just trying to earn
a bit of loose change.

643
00:55:20,833 --> 00:55:22,000
Well, well.

644
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:26,583
Should someone from police HQ
really be visiting me?

645
00:55:26,666 --> 00:55:29,750
Hajime Oda, 29 years old.
We need you to find him.

646
00:55:29,833 --> 00:55:33,125
You must be in a real quandary

647
00:55:33,208 --> 00:55:36,000
if you need help
from an old yakuza nearing retirement.

648
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:38,625
We want him by the end of the year.
Can you do it?

649
00:55:41,583 --> 00:55:44,041
How much will you pay for finding him?

650
00:55:44,125 --> 00:55:45,125
Ten million.

651
00:55:46,833 --> 00:55:49,416
Ten million yen for a young hoodlum.

652
00:55:50,125 --> 00:55:52,000
What on earth did he do?

653
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,125
I'd rather you not ask questions.

654
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:00,083
Of course.

655
00:56:01,541 --> 00:56:02,750
We'll find him.

656
00:56:07,875 --> 00:56:09,083
Welcome home.

657
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:10,791
I'm back.

658
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,416
It's nearly ready.

659
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:21,333
Sure.

660
00:56:25,416 --> 00:56:27,375
I heard you saw my dad today.

661
00:56:27,875 --> 00:56:28,708
Oh?

662
00:56:29,291 --> 00:56:30,416
He called.

663
00:56:31,375 --> 00:56:33,750
He said how hard you've been working.

664
00:56:33,833 --> 00:56:36,625
Yeah, it's been pretty busy.

665
00:56:47,541 --> 00:56:49,583
THERE'S STILL TIME

666
00:56:49,666 --> 00:56:51,541
TELL ME

667
00:56:51,625 --> 00:56:53,125
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

668
00:56:54,583 --> 00:56:55,500
Something up?

669
00:56:56,375 --> 00:56:57,333
No, nothing.

670
00:56:58,458 --> 00:56:59,583
Oh, yes.

671
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:02,708
I wrote something
for the ceremony tomorrow.

672
00:57:03,208 --> 00:57:05,000
-Can you listen to it?
-Sure.

673
00:57:05,083 --> 00:57:06,375
You can eat while I read.

674
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:10,916
Right.

675
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:16,416
"Dear Mom and Dad,

676
00:57:18,083 --> 00:57:22,083
thank you for raising me."

677
00:57:23,291 --> 00:57:27,666
"As an only child,
I used to wish I had siblings."

678
00:57:28,625 --> 00:57:31,541
"But now I realize I was lucky."

679
00:57:33,833 --> 00:57:37,375
"It means I was able to have
your love and affection all to myselfâ€¦"

680
00:57:37,458 --> 00:57:38,791
NEW MESSAGE
ODA

681
00:57:38,875 --> 00:57:42,041
SCREWED IF YOU CAN'T GET THAT MONEY, HUH?

682
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,708
SERVES YOU RIGHT, PRICK

683
00:57:45,083 --> 00:57:47,250
"Dad, when I was really ill,

684
00:57:48,458 --> 00:57:50,916
even though you were away for work,

685
00:57:51,708 --> 00:57:53,541
you came back to see me every week."

686
00:57:54,208 --> 00:57:56,458
"That made me so happy."

687
00:57:56,541 --> 00:57:57,958
WE'VE DONE A LOT FOR YOU

688
00:57:58,041 --> 00:58:01,041
"Today my name will changeâ€¦

689
00:58:01,125 --> 00:58:03,166
WE'VE DONE A LOT FOR YOU UP TO NOW

690
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:05,416
â€¦from Yukiko Uematsu to Yukiko Yazaki."

691
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,583
BUT YOU TREATED ME LIKE AN IDIOT

692
00:58:07,666 --> 00:58:10,750
"But I'll always be your loving daughterâ€¦

693
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,750
forever and ever."

694
00:58:14,833 --> 00:58:16,625
REAP WHAT YOU SOW
YOU'RE DONE

695
00:58:16,708 --> 00:58:21,583
"Mom, Dad, I'm so grateful
for everything you've done for me."

696
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:24,083
BTW YOUR WEDDING IS TOMORROW, RIGHT?

697
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
"Thank you."

698
00:58:27,083 --> 00:58:29,208
WISHING YOU THE UTMOST HAPPINESS LOL

699
00:58:34,166 --> 00:58:35,208
That was so moving.

700
00:59:10,583 --> 00:59:11,708
Cold, huh, Chief?

701
00:59:12,333 --> 00:59:14,208
This is the worst time for a wedding.

702
00:59:14,291 --> 00:59:15,916
UNLESS IT'S ME, THAT DOOR WON'T OPEN

703
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,208
No one holds a wedding
after the 28th, right?

704
00:59:18,291 --> 00:59:19,708
GIVE UP ALREADY

705
00:59:19,791 --> 00:59:22,750
-Not if you're sensible.
-Right.

706
00:59:22,833 --> 00:59:25,875
Only the elite can get away with
a wedding at the end of the year.

707
00:59:25,958 --> 00:59:29,208
Director General Uematsu
is the only elite around here.

708
00:59:29,291 --> 00:59:33,083
Honestly, making a move
on the director general's only daughter?

709
00:59:33,166 --> 00:59:36,166
Yeah. Must be desperate for a promotion.

710
00:59:50,041 --> 00:59:51,125
How's it going?

711
00:59:51,208 --> 00:59:52,625
They're looking for him now.

712
00:59:53,833 --> 00:59:56,666
A dog that bites its owner
needs putting down.

713
00:59:57,250 --> 00:59:59,958
You know what to do with Oda
when he's found, right?

714
01:00:00,041 --> 01:00:01,291
-Yes.
-Right?

715
01:00:01,375 --> 01:00:02,625
Yes.

716
01:00:02,708 --> 01:00:05,416
-Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Yazaki.
-Sure.

717
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:09,875
The hall is making handprint artwork
of the bride and groom.

718
01:00:09,958 --> 01:00:11,041
Press your hand here.

719
01:00:11,125 --> 01:00:12,291
A handprint?

720
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:14,083
-Oh, yes, you said.
-Yes.

721
01:00:14,166 --> 01:00:15,291
Like this?

722
01:00:15,375 --> 01:00:19,250
Yes. We'll get the bride's print
once you've both changed clothes.

723
01:00:19,333 --> 01:00:21,041
-Thanks.
-That's really nice.

724
01:00:21,125 --> 01:00:22,791
A great way to remember this day.

725
01:00:22,875 --> 01:00:24,625
-Want mine as well?
-No, thank you.

726
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:25,541
No?

727
01:00:25,625 --> 01:00:27,500
Right, I'll press here.

728
01:00:27,583 --> 01:00:28,583
Thank you very much.

729
01:00:29,291 --> 01:00:31,250
Sorry to interrupt.

730
01:00:31,333 --> 01:00:34,458
It's time now for a special event.

731
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,625
We would like to create
an artwork of your handprints

732
01:00:42,708 --> 01:00:45,958
to symbolize your unending love
for each other.

733
01:00:50,041 --> 01:00:53,000
The meaning
imbued in this artwork is that,

734
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:55,750
hand in hand,
the couple will share any happiness

735
01:00:55,833 --> 01:00:58,125
and overcome any difficulty together.

736
01:00:58,833 --> 01:01:01,916
First, we'll ask the bride, Yukiko.

737
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:12,041
And the groom, Takayuki, please.

738
01:01:24,833 --> 01:01:25,875
Thank you very much.

739
01:01:26,375 --> 01:01:30,250
Everyone, please come to the front,
and we'll take a picture.

740
01:01:47,125 --> 01:01:48,750
Hello, Mr. Yazaki.

741
01:01:48,833 --> 01:01:51,500
Oda might be on his way there now.
I'll be there soon.

742
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:52,708
Oh, really?

743
01:01:52,791 --> 01:01:53,625
Yeah.

744
01:01:54,458 --> 01:01:55,875
Actually, already here.

745
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:03,416
I did it. It's done.

746
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:04,833
-Oh, you did it?
-Yes.

747
01:02:05,958 --> 01:02:09,375
You won't be able
to open the vault now, will you?

748
01:02:10,583 --> 01:02:12,625
Even though
the officials' money is in there.

749
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:16,125
You're screwed now, aren't you?
Will they let you live?

750
01:02:16,208 --> 01:02:17,375
-What'll you--
-Hey, Oda.

751
01:02:17,458 --> 01:02:20,375
-Huh?
-Do you understand what you've done?

752
01:02:23,125 --> 01:02:24,000
Mr. Yazaki.

753
01:02:24,833 --> 01:02:26,125
You're finished.

754
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:28,375
Suck on that!

755
01:02:28,458 --> 01:02:29,458
Dumbass!

756
01:02:35,291 --> 01:02:36,458
Are you stupid?

757
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:40,041
What the hell are you doing?

758
01:02:40,541 --> 01:02:41,458
I'm very sorry.

759
01:02:42,208 --> 01:02:45,541
If we can't get the money back,
I'm finished.

760
01:02:45,625 --> 01:02:47,125
As are you, of course.

761
01:02:47,208 --> 01:02:48,333
-Yes.
-Understand?

762
01:02:51,833 --> 01:02:52,666
I'm sorry.

763
01:02:54,541 --> 01:02:57,083
It'll be fine. Relax.

764
01:02:57,166 --> 01:02:58,000
Yes, sir.

765
01:02:58,583 --> 01:03:01,833
-You will find Oda and snuff him out.
-Yes.

766
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:04,000
-And return the key.
-Yes, sir.

767
01:03:04,708 --> 01:03:06,833
-You can do that, no problem, right?
-Yes.

768
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:08,000
No problem.

769
01:03:10,083 --> 01:03:11,750
-Yes.
-Dad!

770
01:03:13,791 --> 01:03:17,333
-One of the guests wants a photo with you.
-Sure, just a sec.

771
01:03:26,291 --> 01:03:27,375
By the end of today.

772
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:29,833
Got it?

773
01:03:30,333 --> 01:03:31,166
Yes.

774
01:03:47,666 --> 01:03:48,500
Yes?

775
01:03:48,583 --> 01:03:50,250
This is Senba.

776
01:03:50,333 --> 01:03:53,208
Yazaki, it seems luck is on your side.

777
01:03:53,958 --> 01:03:57,291
My guys found that punk Oda's hideout.

778
01:04:01,708 --> 01:04:02,750
Really?

779
01:04:02,833 --> 01:04:05,708
Oda was selling drugs on the side.

780
01:04:06,291 --> 01:04:10,208
He was using some girl
from a nightclub to sell his stuff.

781
01:04:10,875 --> 01:04:14,958
We tracked her and found his hideout.

782
01:04:15,041 --> 01:04:16,583
That's good to hear.

783
01:04:17,833 --> 01:04:19,000
Where is this place?

784
01:04:19,958 --> 01:04:20,833
I'll tell you.

785
01:04:21,875 --> 01:04:25,083
It's just that ten million
isn't really enough.

786
01:04:27,083 --> 01:04:28,000
What?

787
01:04:28,083 --> 01:04:31,166
I had it looked into.

788
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:32,875
That's some amount.

789
01:04:33,666 --> 01:04:37,458
That's one big pile you're dealing with.

790
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:39,333
Who told you?

791
01:04:39,416 --> 01:04:41,083
As payment for finding him,

792
01:04:41,791 --> 01:04:42,875
one hundred million?

793
01:04:43,458 --> 01:04:45,625
One hundred million, how about that?

794
01:04:49,666 --> 01:04:52,291
If Oda takes it, there'll be nothing.

795
01:04:54,041 --> 01:04:58,666
Don't worry. We've taken care of that.

796
01:05:30,125 --> 01:05:30,958
What's this?

797
01:05:34,041 --> 01:05:35,500
Hey, what's going on?

798
01:05:35,583 --> 01:05:37,583
This isn't what we agreed on!

799
01:05:46,875 --> 01:05:48,458
Oda, you're late.

800
01:06:00,375 --> 01:06:01,208
Where's Oda?

801
01:06:11,250 --> 01:06:13,416
Has he gone to get the money?

802
01:06:18,833 --> 01:06:19,916
Well?

803
01:06:28,291 --> 01:06:30,958
Will he be coming back here?

804
01:06:47,208 --> 01:06:48,166
Hey, Mayuko.

805
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:51,208
It's no good. The Senba group was there.

806
01:06:51,791 --> 01:06:53,250
It's not what they promised.

807
01:06:54,708 --> 01:06:56,125
Messing with me.

808
01:06:58,583 --> 01:07:00,208
What's the matter?

809
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:01,750
Oda.

810
01:07:07,875 --> 01:07:11,041
I was an idiot to trust you.

811
01:07:14,791 --> 01:07:16,625
You can pay me back now by dying.

812
01:07:20,916 --> 01:07:22,208
Seriously?

813
01:07:22,916 --> 01:07:24,291
Seriously.

814
01:07:28,916 --> 01:07:30,333
Youâ€¦

815
01:07:32,958 --> 01:07:33,791
Shit.

816
01:07:52,541 --> 01:07:53,583
You little punk!

817
01:07:56,666 --> 01:07:57,791
Don't mess with me!

818
01:08:03,083 --> 01:08:04,541
You fucking punk!

819
01:08:22,833 --> 01:08:24,458
Hey!

820
01:08:28,208 --> 01:08:31,583
What is this? Hey!

821
01:08:59,375 --> 01:09:00,625
Hey, wait!

822
01:09:00,708 --> 01:09:01,916
Noâ€¦

823
01:09:04,041 --> 01:09:05,625
He has taken off with him!

824
01:09:07,083 --> 01:09:10,666
Shit!

825
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:33,583
What the hell is he doing?

826
01:09:49,708 --> 01:09:53,000
Evening, sir. I'm Kaji from
the traffic division at Aihara station.

827
01:09:53,083 --> 01:09:55,333
Detective Kudo from the same station.

828
01:09:57,125 --> 01:10:00,125
Detective? You're a detective
from Aihara station?

829
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:14,625
-Yazaki from Internal Affairs.
-Thanks for coming.

830
01:10:14,708 --> 01:10:16,625
Thanks for coming at this time of year.

831
01:10:16,708 --> 01:10:17,541
Sure.

832
01:10:17,625 --> 01:10:19,958
Congratulations on your wedding today.

833
01:10:21,208 --> 01:10:22,958
That was Kudo.

834
01:10:23,041 --> 01:10:26,125
He can't come tonight
because of the funeral preparations.

835
01:10:26,208 --> 01:10:28,125
He said he'll come tomorrow morning.

836
01:10:34,041 --> 01:10:34,958
I see.

837
01:10:35,583 --> 01:10:41,541
AIHARA POLICE STATION

838
01:10:56,166 --> 01:10:57,000
Soâ€¦

839
01:11:00,708 --> 01:11:03,416
you're telling me
that detective took the body away,

840
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:05,666
and now you have no idea where it is?

841
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:06,708
Yes.

842
01:11:06,791 --> 01:11:08,875
But I'm meeting
that detective in the morning,

843
01:11:08,958 --> 01:11:11,458
so I'll somehow persuade him
and get it back.

844
01:11:11,958 --> 01:11:13,166
I'm very sorry.

845
01:11:13,666 --> 01:11:16,416
How stupid can you be?

846
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:21,458
I had no idea you were such a loser!

847
01:11:22,125 --> 01:11:25,041
I'm ashamed of myself!

848
01:11:25,125 --> 01:11:29,083
Ashamed I chose someone as stupid as you!

849
01:11:30,333 --> 01:11:32,458
I thought you were loyal to me.

850
01:11:32,541 --> 01:11:34,541
That's why I gave you special treatment.

851
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:36,916
But you were just a stupid fool!

852
01:11:41,083 --> 01:11:43,208
I shouldn't have let you have my daughter.

853
01:11:44,291 --> 01:11:46,250
I thought you'd be more useful.

854
01:11:47,708 --> 01:11:48,791
But enough is enough.

855
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:54,583
Leave my daughter
at the start of the new year.

856
01:11:56,083 --> 01:11:58,416
Forget any ideas you had
about being promoted.

857
01:12:01,666 --> 01:12:03,375
You're finished.

858
01:12:33,625 --> 01:12:34,541
Uematsu.

859
01:12:41,208 --> 01:12:42,500
Yazaki!

860
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:58,041
FUNERAL

861
01:14:01,958 --> 01:14:02,833
Honestly.

862
01:14:04,958 --> 01:14:06,833
What happened to your face?

863
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:16,583
What is it?

864
01:14:20,583 --> 01:14:21,833
I'll leave the rest to you.

865
01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:23,916
-Yes, sir.
-Mr. Kugayama.

866
01:14:25,125 --> 01:14:27,333
-It's about the car.
-What's up?

867
01:14:27,416 --> 01:14:29,708
We got this from another security camera.

868
01:14:38,291 --> 01:14:39,291
What do you mean?

869
01:14:41,333 --> 01:14:44,333
Don't worry.
I'll bring Mina back after the funeral.

870
01:14:44,416 --> 01:14:47,208
What do you mean, "don't worry"?

871
01:14:48,458 --> 01:14:51,125
Does that mean they've abducted Mina?

872
01:14:54,166 --> 01:14:55,041
Answer me!

873
01:14:55,125 --> 01:14:56,750
I told you not to worry.

874
01:14:56,833 --> 01:14:58,875
-It'll be fine.
-What is going on?

875
01:15:01,916 --> 01:15:02,958
What is this?

876
01:15:05,041 --> 01:15:05,958
Why?

877
01:15:07,916 --> 01:15:10,791
Why does this stuff
always happen with you?

878
01:15:18,375 --> 01:15:19,833
If something happens to Mina,

879
01:15:20,416 --> 01:15:22,208
I will never forgive you.

880
01:15:55,083 --> 01:15:57,416
His poor wife.
It's a lot to handle at this time of year.

881
01:16:02,375 --> 01:16:04,250
Now we'll bring out the coffin.

882
01:16:04,333 --> 01:16:06,666
-This isn't easy.
-Careful!

883
01:16:06,750 --> 01:16:07,791
You okay?

884
01:16:07,875 --> 01:16:08,875
Yeah, I'm fine.

885
01:16:08,958 --> 01:16:10,041
It's so heavy.

886
01:16:10,125 --> 01:16:11,125
Wait a minute.

887
01:16:11,208 --> 01:16:12,916
Oh, I kicked someone's shoes.

888
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,166
-It's fine.
-Your shoes?

889
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:15,125
I've got them on.

890
01:16:16,125 --> 01:16:17,166
Watch the step.

891
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:19,583
All good.

892
01:16:20,916 --> 01:16:22,833
There we go.

893
01:16:25,541 --> 01:16:26,375
Thanks.

894
01:16:29,583 --> 01:16:31,875
The Kudo family, please take the bus.

895
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:39,791
HEARTFUL AIHARA

896
01:16:47,541 --> 01:16:49,208
NEW MESSAGE

897
01:16:54,958 --> 01:16:57,416
AIHARA RESERVOIR, AICHI PREFECTURE

898
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:11,208
Hello again.

899
01:17:11,875 --> 01:17:14,500
I will now show you to the waiting room.

900
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:19,333
Please watch the step.

901
01:17:21,833 --> 01:17:22,750
Hey, wait.

902
01:17:24,041 --> 01:17:25,333
I have to take this.

903
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:39,041
Stop right there!

904
01:17:40,333 --> 01:17:41,166
Police.

905
01:17:41,916 --> 01:17:43,708
-There's been an incident.
-Incident?

906
01:17:43,791 --> 01:17:46,208
I need you
to go to a safe place immediately.

907
01:17:46,291 --> 01:17:47,166
What?

908
01:17:48,625 --> 01:17:50,500
-Come on now, hurry!
-Yes!

909
01:17:52,083 --> 01:17:55,000
Wait! Why did you switch it on?

910
01:18:12,583 --> 01:18:13,416
Kudo.

911
01:18:18,166 --> 01:18:19,083
Kugayama.

912
01:18:19,583 --> 01:18:23,416
What are you hiding from us?

913
01:18:23,958 --> 01:18:24,833
What?

914
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:28,583
This is your car, right?

915
01:18:34,291 --> 01:18:35,125
Come on.

916
01:18:36,125 --> 01:18:37,500
Just tell me the truth.

917
01:18:44,791 --> 01:18:45,916
I'll tell you later.

918
01:18:46,916 --> 01:18:48,041
I need your help.

919
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:50,583
What?

920
01:18:52,875 --> 01:18:53,708
Damn!

921
01:18:55,708 --> 01:18:56,666
Ready, andâ€¦

922
01:19:00,416 --> 01:19:02,666
Seriously, what kind of story is that?

923
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:03,791
Sounds made up.

924
01:19:03,875 --> 01:19:05,083
I wish it were.

925
01:19:07,458 --> 01:19:09,125
Why does he want this body so much?

926
01:19:09,208 --> 01:19:10,500
That's what I want to know.

927
01:19:10,583 --> 01:19:12,000
Did you take a good look?

928
01:19:12,083 --> 01:19:13,041
What?

929
01:19:28,416 --> 01:19:29,458
He's been shot.

930
01:19:29,958 --> 01:19:30,791
What?

931
01:19:31,291 --> 01:19:34,875
Which means he was shot
before you ran him over.

932
01:19:34,958 --> 01:19:37,000
What the hell? What's going on here?

933
01:19:53,458 --> 01:19:55,500
MISSED CALLS
MAYUKO, YAZAKI

934
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:00,250
MAYUKO

935
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:04,500
Hi, Oda?

936
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:12,958
You're alive! I was so worried.

937
01:20:13,041 --> 01:20:14,208
I called so many times.

938
01:20:14,291 --> 01:20:16,625
Why didn't you answer?
I thought you were dead!

939
01:20:17,791 --> 01:20:19,500
Such a relief.

940
01:20:19,583 --> 01:20:21,375
I was really worried!

941
01:20:22,208 --> 01:20:23,958
Where are you now? The factory?

942
01:20:25,666 --> 01:20:26,916
Okay. I'll be there soon.

943
01:20:48,333 --> 01:20:50,916
Hey, you're late!

944
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:55,250
What?

945
01:20:56,041 --> 01:20:57,708
Wait, what?

946
01:20:58,291 --> 01:20:59,916
Wait, who are you?

947
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,166
Go away! Seriously, who are you?

948
01:21:03,791 --> 01:21:06,666
He's the one
who ran off with the key card!

949
01:21:12,125 --> 01:21:13,000
This is it.

950
01:21:13,083 --> 01:21:13,916
GOOD LUCK CHARM

951
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,250
So that's what it's about.

952
01:21:16,333 --> 01:21:19,458
By the way, the second lock
won't open without his fingerprint.

953
01:21:22,375 --> 01:21:24,750
So that's why he wanted the body.

954
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,958
I can't take this.

955
01:21:36,041 --> 01:21:37,291
What will you do?

956
01:21:40,541 --> 01:21:42,125
Get my daughter back.

957
01:21:43,333 --> 01:21:44,416
That's dangerous.

958
01:21:47,416 --> 01:21:49,208
It's the only thing I can do.

959
01:21:55,625 --> 01:21:57,583
I'll get Chief Awashima's advice.

960
01:21:58,875 --> 01:22:01,416
You just think about
how to rescue your daughter.

961
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:04,208
But don't do anything on your own.

962
01:22:05,083 --> 01:22:06,875
We'll take care of it somehow.

963
01:22:07,625 --> 01:22:08,583
Kugayama.

964
01:22:11,291 --> 01:22:12,125
Thanks.

965
01:22:19,041 --> 01:22:20,791
UNKNOWN CALLER

966
01:22:30,416 --> 01:22:31,250
Yes?

967
01:22:31,333 --> 01:22:33,083
Who are you with right now?

968
01:22:33,791 --> 01:22:35,416
None of your business.

969
01:22:36,333 --> 01:22:38,625
Don't you care
what happens to your daughter?

970
01:22:41,708 --> 01:22:43,166
I need to talk with you.

971
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:44,833
Get out of the car.

972
01:22:55,791 --> 01:22:56,666
What is it?

973
01:22:57,416 --> 01:22:59,000
Move away from the car first.

974
01:22:59,083 --> 01:23:00,416
Then I'll tell you.

975
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:36,625
Whatâ€¦

976
01:23:36,708 --> 01:23:38,416
what have you done?

977
01:23:39,875 --> 01:23:41,166
What the hell did you do?

978
01:23:42,541 --> 01:23:44,375
Don't get any stupid ideas.

979
01:23:45,125 --> 01:23:46,541
You should be talking to me.

980
01:23:47,041 --> 01:23:48,083
Minaâ€¦

981
01:23:48,166 --> 01:23:50,875
If anything happens to Mina,
there'll be hell to pay.

982
01:23:51,375 --> 01:23:52,208
Hey!

983
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:54,333
Bring Oda's body.

984
01:24:04,291 --> 01:24:05,458
Fuck!

985
01:24:13,250 --> 01:24:15,791
What was that loud noise?

986
01:24:15,875 --> 01:24:16,708
You okay?

987
01:24:18,958 --> 01:24:20,250
You gonna cut me free?

988
01:24:20,333 --> 01:24:22,458
Come on. Do it quickly.

989
01:24:26,583 --> 01:24:28,208
Hey, what are you doing?

990
01:24:28,291 --> 01:24:29,666
Hey, stop that!

991
01:24:29,750 --> 01:24:32,791
Are you crazy? Stop that!

992
01:24:33,666 --> 01:24:34,500
Wait--

993
01:24:41,666 --> 01:24:44,666
As soon as you swap
the body for your daughter,

994
01:24:45,291 --> 01:24:48,000
no doubt he'll take you out.

995
01:24:49,458 --> 01:24:51,166
Whoa, incredible.

996
01:24:51,666 --> 01:24:52,916
What era is this?

997
01:24:54,458 --> 01:24:57,625
If it comes to a normal gunfight,
you won't beat him.

998
01:24:57,708 --> 01:24:58,916
I know that.

999
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,208
But what other way is there?

1000
01:25:01,291 --> 01:25:04,541
Oh, this takes me back!

1001
01:25:05,041 --> 01:25:06,833
I made this myself.

1002
01:25:07,875 --> 01:25:08,750
What is it?

1003
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:10,583
A bomb?

1004
01:25:11,208 --> 01:25:13,666
It blows up
exactly four minutes after you set it.

1005
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:15,916
Those were the good old days.

1006
01:25:41,833 --> 01:25:43,083
Did you bring it?

1007
01:25:43,958 --> 01:25:44,791
Mina?

1008
01:25:45,583 --> 01:25:46,958
She's in the car. Show me the body.

1009
01:25:47,041 --> 01:25:48,958
-Mina!
-You show me first.

1010
01:26:19,583 --> 01:26:21,125
Is she really there?

1011
01:26:21,833 --> 01:26:23,250
Show me if she is.

1012
01:26:31,291 --> 01:26:32,166
Get out.

1013
01:26:34,583 --> 01:26:36,083
-Daddy!
-Mina.

1014
01:26:36,166 --> 01:26:37,500
Mina!

1015
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,541
You won't get her
until I've checked the body.

1016
01:26:40,625 --> 01:26:41,625
Bring it here.

1017
01:26:58,583 --> 01:26:59,458
Open it up.

1018
01:27:09,875 --> 01:27:10,791
Put him in.

1019
01:27:30,833 --> 01:27:32,083
Good.

1020
01:27:32,166 --> 01:27:33,041
-Daddy!
-Mina!

1021
01:27:33,125 --> 01:27:35,750
Mina, I'm so sorry.

1022
01:27:39,458 --> 01:27:40,291
Hey!

1023
01:27:40,375 --> 01:27:42,708
No time for a little chat?

1024
01:27:47,541 --> 01:27:50,166
Mina, listen to me.

1025
01:27:50,250 --> 01:27:51,333
Listen, okay?

1026
01:27:52,250 --> 01:27:54,166
Get into that car over there.

1027
01:27:54,250 --> 01:27:56,166
Daddy will join you soon, okay?

1028
01:27:56,791 --> 01:27:58,208
Ready, go!

1029
01:28:29,250 --> 01:28:31,875
If I don't return in one piece,

1030
01:28:32,666 --> 01:28:34,875
the media will get
a copy of your indictment.

1031
01:28:36,541 --> 01:28:38,416
I've arranged it with the Senba boss.

1032
01:28:44,083 --> 01:28:45,333
I've given you the body.

1033
01:28:46,083 --> 01:28:49,625
I don't want anything more
to do with this now.

1034
01:29:17,208 --> 01:29:18,708
What now?

1035
01:29:18,791 --> 01:29:22,250
I was right. You and I are the same.

1036
01:29:22,875 --> 01:29:24,000
What?

1037
01:29:24,083 --> 01:29:27,250
What's the point of being a detective
in a town like this?

1038
01:29:27,333 --> 01:29:28,166
What?

1039
01:29:28,666 --> 01:29:31,625
Dragged around by whatever's
in front of you, day after day,

1040
01:29:31,708 --> 01:29:33,500
with only pennies to show for it.

1041
01:29:33,583 --> 01:29:35,583
Is that how you want to live your life?

1042
01:29:38,208 --> 01:29:39,166
Come on, Kudo.

1043
01:29:42,708 --> 01:29:43,750
Join me.

1044
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,333
You'll be rich.

1045
01:29:49,083 --> 01:29:51,333
If you have money, you can do anything.

1046
01:29:52,375 --> 01:29:53,208
Well?

1047
01:29:59,250 --> 01:30:00,083
Go to hell.

1048
01:30:00,708 --> 01:30:01,708
What?

1049
01:31:00,666 --> 01:31:01,916
-Mina!
-Mommy!

1050
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:02,916
Mina!

1051
01:31:04,833 --> 01:31:05,833
Mina!

1052
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,291
I'm so relieved.

1053
01:31:14,125 --> 01:31:15,916
I'm so glad you're safe.

1054
01:31:23,791 --> 01:31:25,833
Mina and I are leaving this town.

1055
01:31:26,958 --> 01:31:28,625
We can't be here any longer.

1056
01:31:35,666 --> 01:31:36,583
Okay.

1057
01:31:44,791 --> 01:31:47,458
What are you going to do now?

1058
01:31:55,166 --> 01:31:57,500
There's a lizard that lives in the desert.

1059
01:31:59,875 --> 01:32:00,708
What?

1060
01:32:02,083 --> 01:32:04,208
The sand on the ground is hot,

1061
01:32:05,666 --> 01:32:08,083
so it hops from one leg to the other

1062
01:32:09,125 --> 01:32:12,291
while staying in the same place
on the sand.

1063
01:32:16,750 --> 01:32:19,083
Better to go somewhere else, surely.

1064
01:32:20,041 --> 01:32:21,750
But it doesn't leave.

1065
01:32:26,166 --> 01:32:30,208
It just keeps hopping
from one leg to the other.

1066
01:32:34,333 --> 01:32:36,458
It doesn't leave the desert.

1067
01:32:47,125 --> 01:32:51,208
I'm sorry I couldn't make you happy.

1068
01:33:43,416 --> 01:33:45,250
This year was full-on.

1069
01:33:45,333 --> 01:33:47,291
Yeah. We got through it though.

1070
01:34:14,666 --> 01:34:17,666
GOOD LUCK CHARM

1071
01:36:00,041 --> 01:36:01,916
Please come forward slowly.

1072
01:36:05,958 --> 01:36:06,791
It's snowing.

1073
01:36:07,291 --> 01:36:08,125
Wow.

1074
01:36:09,375 --> 01:36:12,083
-Snow?
-Hey, it started snowing!

1075
01:36:14,666 --> 01:36:19,666
Excitement is rising
as the start of the new year approaches.

1076
01:36:20,166 --> 01:36:23,791
How has this year been for you?

1077
01:36:44,291 --> 01:36:47,791
"If you have money, you can do anything."

1078
01:41:59,166 --> 01:42:00,500
Ready, andâ€¦

1079
01:42:35,541 --> 01:42:38,541
The countdown has started.

1080
01:42:38,625 --> 01:42:41,541
-Ten, nine, eightâ€¦
-Just a few moments until the new year.

1081
01:42:41,625 --> 01:42:44,333
â€¦seven, six,

1082
01:42:44,416 --> 01:42:47,375
five, four, three,

1083
01:42:47,916 --> 01:42:48,791
twoâ€¦

1084
01:43:04,875 --> 01:43:07,875
It's the start of a new year.

1085
01:43:09,125 --> 01:43:10,833
Happy New Year to you all!

1086
01:43:43,708 --> 01:43:45,333
Sorry, Kudo.

1087
01:43:46,750 --> 01:43:51,833
It was me who tipped off
the tabloids about the bribes.

1088
01:43:53,750 --> 01:43:59,041
This world didn't leave us enough money
to pass on to the next generation.

1089
01:43:59,708 --> 01:44:00,750
But it's all right.

1090
01:44:01,291 --> 01:44:03,250
Now we're loaded.

1091
01:44:03,333 --> 01:44:04,791
All thanks to you both.

1092
01:44:07,958 --> 01:44:11,416
So there were two desert lizards
who writhed around

1093
01:44:12,083 --> 01:44:15,625
and ended up dying from the heat.

1094
01:44:18,041 --> 01:44:19,833
Get the money out.

1095
01:44:53,625 --> 01:44:57,458
WHAT WILL THE NEW YEAR BRING?

1096
01:44:58,958 --> 01:45:01,541
How do you feel?
Any New Year's resolutions?

1097
01:47:14,291 --> 01:47:15,166
Hello.

1098
01:47:17,875 --> 01:47:18,958
Were you sleeping?

1099
01:47:21,958 --> 01:47:23,000
What's the matter?

1100
01:47:24,708 --> 01:47:25,583
Nothing.

1101
01:47:28,375 --> 01:47:30,541
Just wanted to have a proper chat.

1102
01:47:33,333 --> 01:47:34,250
What is it?

1103
01:47:39,500 --> 01:47:41,166
Are you really leaving?

1104
01:47:47,541 --> 01:47:48,416
Hey.

1105
01:47:51,750 --> 01:47:54,000
Can't we give it one more go?

1106
01:48:02,583 --> 01:48:04,041
How can you say that?

1107
01:48:06,125 --> 01:48:07,000
Incredible.

1108
01:48:10,541 --> 01:48:11,625
I have a feelingâ€¦

1109
01:48:15,458 --> 01:48:17,875
that this is going to be a good year.

1110
01:48:20,708 --> 01:48:23,166
Last year really sucked.

1111
01:48:26,166 --> 01:48:29,500
But I think this year will be better.

1112
01:48:39,458 --> 01:48:43,375
You say that every year.

1113
01:48:53,125 --> 01:48:54,125
Oh, right.

1114
01:48:55,625 --> 01:48:57,166
Is it Daddy?

1115
01:48:58,125 --> 01:48:58,958
Yeah.

1116
01:49:01,125 --> 01:49:03,666
Daddy, come back home soon!

1117
01:49:06,041 --> 01:49:07,166
You heard her.

1118
01:49:09,083 --> 01:49:12,291
Just come home soon.

1119
01:49:16,500 --> 01:49:17,333
Yeah.

1120
01:49:19,875 --> 01:49:20,708
Okay.

1121
01:51:47,250 --> 01:51:50,625
HARD DAYS

1122
01:52:26,083 --> 01:52:27,333
Sorry! I'm sorry!

1123
01:52:29,916 --> 01:52:32,708
I'll pay you properly. This month.

1124
01:52:33,458 --> 01:52:34,833
I swear! Please!

1125
01:52:40,291 --> 01:52:41,666
Somebody, help!

1126
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:51,166
I'll pay you. I'm sorry.

1127
01:52:54,125 --> 01:52:55,166
Hey, kid.

1128
01:52:57,041 --> 01:52:59,125
Do you want to get out of the desert?

1129
01:53:02,125 --> 01:53:03,166
What?

1130
01:57:11,250 --> 01:57:16,833

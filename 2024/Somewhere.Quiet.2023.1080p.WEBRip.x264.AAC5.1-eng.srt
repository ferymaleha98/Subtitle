[tense music]

10
00:01:26,912 --> 00:01:28,914

No.

18
00:02:22,968 --> 00:02:25,884
We gotta put the big
black one in first.

19
00:02:35,372 --> 00:02:36,243
No, Meg, hold on.

20
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:37,591
Just wait, okay?

21
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:40,203
Okay?

22
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,204
All right, I got it.

00:02:51,606 --> 00:02:55,218
[muffled radio chattering]

25
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,401
I grabbed your journal.

26
00:03:06,273 --> 00:03:07,622
It was under the couch.

27
00:03:13,715 --> 00:03:14,759
- You hungry?

28
00:03:14,846 --> 00:03:15,934
- Not really.

00:03:18,502 --> 00:03:21,201
[turning signal clicking]

30
00:03:21,288 --> 00:03:22,419
I'm not hungry.

31
00:03:24,552 --> 00:03:26,206
- Okay, but I gotta get gas.

32
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:28,947
- Fine.

33
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:31,863
Sorry.

34
00:03:45,137 --> 00:03:48,880
[car doors thudding softly]

35
00:03:52,144 --> 00:03:54,973
[gas pump beeps]

36
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,330
- [Newscaster] City Hall
today, a protest

37
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:06,898
led by public safety
advocates aims to put pressure

38
00:04:06,985 --> 00:04:08,944
on the Boston police department.

39
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:10,859
- [Protester] How many
other women and girls

40
00:04:10,946 --> 00:04:13,818
has the Boston police
stopped looking for?

41
00:04:13,905 --> 00:04:17,779
[muffled protesters shouting]

42
00:04:19,606 --> 00:04:21,565
[chip bag crackling]

43
00:04:21,652 --> 00:04:22,523
- [Newscaster] The
department came

44
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,828
under pressure this spring-

45
00:04:23,915 --> 00:04:25,482
- Excuse me.
- After the shocking return

46
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:26,831
of Megan Rhoads.

47
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:27,919
The 32-year-old Beacon
Hill resident

[tense music]
[low rumbling]

49
00:04:29,225 --> 00:04:30,922
had been assumed dead
by the police

50
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:33,447
after she disappeared
from nearby parking garage

51
00:04:33,534 --> 00:04:36,319
nearly six months earlier.

52
00:04:41,455 --> 00:04:44,022
[tense music]

53
00:04:48,853 --> 00:04:50,290
- My great-grandfather
bought this place

54
00:04:50,377 --> 00:04:51,943
in the 20s, I think?

55
00:04:55,469 --> 00:04:58,254
We used to own everything
to the end of that road.

56
00:04:58,341 --> 00:05:00,822
[Meg chuckles softly]

57
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:29,633

[Meg gasps]

63
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,826
- Sorry.

64
00:06:37,308 --> 00:06:39,137
- I'll grab the rest
of the bags.

65
00:06:39,224 --> 00:06:40,095
- Okay.

66
00:06:49,757 --> 00:06:52,890
[water whooshing]

67
00:06:53,151 --> 00:06:54,631
Where were your parents?

68
00:06:55,502 --> 00:06:58,026
- The adults all stayed
at the big house, mostly.

69
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,680
Let me get this.

70
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:01,029
- I got it.

71
00:07:01,116 --> 00:07:02,552
Where's that?

72
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,815
- Well, the big house used
to be down by the beach,

73
00:07:04,902 --> 00:07:07,427
but they tore it down
when I was a kid.

74
00:07:07,514 --> 00:07:08,428
- Why?

75
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,518
- 'Cause no one could
afford the property taxes.

76
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:12,475
It was massive.

77
00:07:15,304 --> 00:07:16,914
- [Meg] So you were here alone?

78
00:07:17,741 --> 00:07:19,351
- Well, with the rest
of the cousins.

79
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,092
This was like the cousins house.

80
00:07:22,224 --> 00:07:23,834
My grandmother hated
kids, I think,

81
00:07:23,921 --> 00:07:26,097
so she put us all in this house

82
00:07:26,184 --> 00:07:28,883
so she didn't have
to deal with us.

83
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:29,971
- She sounds sweet.

84
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:32,800
- No, she wasn't sweet.

85
00:07:33,757 --> 00:07:34,976
We wouldn't see her all summer

86
00:07:35,063 --> 00:07:37,195
and then one day she
would summon us down

87
00:07:37,282 --> 00:07:40,284
and individually interview
us about our interests

88
00:07:40,372 --> 00:07:42,374
and tell us us stand
up straight.

89
00:07:44,376 --> 00:07:45,508
Can I finish this?
- Oh.

90
00:07:45,595 --> 00:07:47,118
[glass clatters loudly]
Shit, sorry.

91
00:07:47,205 --> 00:07:48,119
- I'm sorry.

92
00:07:49,077 --> 00:07:50,557
Meg, you don't have shoes on.

93
00:07:50,644 --> 00:07:52,602
Just back away, it's okay.

94
00:07:59,174 --> 00:08:02,656
[broken glass rustling]

95
00:08:02,743 --> 00:08:05,485

[broken glass clattering]

97
00:08:13,405 --> 00:08:14,929
- Is anyone else coming down?

98
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:17,192
- Doubt it.

99
00:08:18,976 --> 00:08:20,630
It's pretty empty in the winter.

100
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,332
You sure you didn't...

101
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:29,247
You alright?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

102
00:08:29,334 --> 00:08:30,684
Thank you.

103
00:08:30,771 --> 00:08:32,554
[Scott chuckles softly]

104
00:08:32,816 --> 00:08:33,948

107
00:09:00,801 --> 00:09:01,671
Good?

108
00:09:04,065 --> 00:09:04,979
You sure?

109
00:09:09,984 --> 00:09:10,854
Come here.

110
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,950
[Scott snores loudly]

111
00:09:26,043 --> 00:09:29,264

[tense music]

120
00:10:51,955 --> 00:10:52,826
- Scott?

121
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:31,865
[Meg breathes shakily]

122
00:11:53,408 --> 00:11:54,322
Scott.

123
00:11:56,846 --> 00:11:57,717
Scott!

124
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:00,371
[Scott grunts]

125
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:01,372
Meg.

126
00:12:04,071 --> 00:12:04,941
It's okay.

127
00:12:06,508 --> 00:12:07,596
You're okay.

128
00:12:08,945 --> 00:12:09,990
You're okay.

129
00:12:11,818 --> 00:12:12,862
You're safe.

130
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:20,435
- You were sleepwalking.

131
00:12:20,522 --> 00:12:21,349
- Hm?

132
00:12:21,436 --> 00:12:22,350
- Last night.

133
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,749
Is there a dog here?

134
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:31,707
- A dog?

135
00:12:34,492 --> 00:12:39,236
- I heard a dog bark and then
I dropped that weird plate.

136
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:43,066
- What plate?

137
00:12:43,153 --> 00:12:45,721
[tense music]

138
00:12:52,989 --> 00:12:55,862
- You remember you dropped
a glass last night?

139
00:12:56,253 --> 00:12:59,343
- No, it was right here.

140
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,913
[Scott sighs]

141
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,263
- You remember what
Dr. Potter said?

142
00:13:07,743 --> 00:13:10,398
Sometimes nightmares can
feel really real.

143
00:13:13,488 --> 00:13:16,883
[glass clatters sharply]

144
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:17,709
You okay?

145
00:13:18,972 --> 00:13:19,711
[Meg exhales shakily]

146
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,538
- Yeah.

147
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:21,931
[Scott kisses]

148
00:13:22,018 --> 00:13:22,889

[bird chirping]

161
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:15,784
- I've been thinking
about Christmas.

162
00:15:16,654 --> 00:15:17,568
- Mm-hmm.

163
00:15:19,614 --> 00:15:21,572
- It might be nice to
spend it at home.

164
00:15:24,097 --> 00:15:25,968
- I thought you wanted
to come out here.

165
00:15:27,143 --> 00:15:28,231
- I did, but...

166
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:30,016
[dog barking]

167
00:15:30,103 --> 00:15:31,278
- [Woman] Yoo-hoo!

168
00:15:31,365 --> 00:15:32,453

[dog barking]

171
00:15:40,765 --> 00:15:42,245
- Hey, Minnow.

172
00:15:42,332 --> 00:15:43,333
Minnow!

173
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,944
[Minnow barking]
Down!

174
00:15:45,031 --> 00:15:46,380
Down, Minnow!
- Minnow, off.

175
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,733
Talkie. [laughs]
- Madelin.

176
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,126
What are you doing here?

177
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:56,042
I was just out for a
walk and I saw your car.

178
00:15:56,129 --> 00:15:57,521
I'm staying at my mother's
little shack.

179
00:15:57,608 --> 00:15:58,696
- [Scott] How's your mom doing?

180
00:15:58,783 --> 00:16:00,350
- [Madelin] Not well,
I'm afraid.

181
00:16:00,437 --> 00:16:01,221
- I'm so sorry, that's tough.

182
00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:02,222
- Yeah.

183
00:16:03,788 --> 00:16:08,228
And Meg, I'm so glad
to see you again!

184
00:16:08,315 --> 00:16:09,969
- I'm sorry?

185
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:13,450
- Meg, this is my
cousin Madelin.

186
00:16:13,537 --> 00:16:14,974
You met her at the wedding.

187
00:16:15,061 --> 00:16:16,410
- Oh.

188
00:16:16,497 --> 00:16:17,628
- We've got a big family.

189
00:16:17,715 --> 00:16:20,762
I won't hold it against
you. [chuckles]

190
00:16:21,632 --> 00:16:24,809
So, how long are you here for?

191
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:26,594
Not sure.
- Through the New Year.

192
00:16:27,551 --> 00:16:29,771
- I can't believe Talkie
didn't tell me

193
00:16:29,858 --> 00:16:31,338
you two were coming. [laughs]

194
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:34,384
I didn't know anybody
was gonna be here.

195
00:16:34,471 --> 00:16:35,907
- Talkie?

196
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:40,390
- Oh, well, Scott was
so quiet as a kid.

197
00:16:40,477 --> 00:16:42,262
I don't think he said
a word until you

198
00:16:42,349 --> 00:16:43,654
were what, two years old?

199
00:16:43,741 --> 00:16:45,004
- Okay, I don't think we
need to talk about this.

200
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:47,049
- So we started calling
him, you know,

201
00:16:47,136 --> 00:16:48,746
I think it was grandmother
who first...

202
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:51,445
In any case, we started calling
him walkie-talkie as a joke,

203
00:16:51,532 --> 00:16:55,536
and then just walkie Scotty,
and then just talkie.

204
00:16:56,406 --> 00:16:57,886
- Poor Scott.

205
00:16:57,973 --> 00:16:58,887
- Sorry?

206
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:03,196
He just told me how tough
your grandmother could be.

207
00:17:03,283 --> 00:17:04,196
- Oh, I was just telling
her about

208
00:17:04,284 --> 00:17:06,286
the famous sit-down interviews.

209
00:17:06,502 --> 00:17:07,461
- Right.

210
00:17:10,724 --> 00:17:13,902
You know, I had a friend
in college named Meg.

211
00:17:13,989 --> 00:17:16,252
It was short for Megumi.

212
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,645
- Oh.

213
00:17:17,732 --> 00:17:19,429
- Is your name short
for anything?

214
00:17:21,605 --> 00:17:22,519
- Megan.

215
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,914
- So you need some
cream and sugar?

216
00:17:26,915 --> 00:17:29,483
- Did you forget how
I take my tea?

217
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:30,832
- Do you wanna do it yourself-
- Has it been that long?

218
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:32,181
- -you can just take care of it.

219
00:17:32,268 --> 00:17:34,401
- [Madelin] Has it been
that long? [laughs]

220
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:37,099
[tense music]

221
00:17:49,894 --> 00:17:54,943
[thudding]
[woman whimpering]

222
00:18:00,949 --> 00:18:04,474
[doors rustling]

223
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:07,608
[woman whimpering]
[Meg gasps]

224
00:18:07,695 --> 00:18:11,002
[Meg breathes shakily]

225
00:18:11,873 --> 00:18:15,137
[tennis ball thumping]

226
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,448
[Meg exhales shakily]

227
00:18:21,535 --> 00:18:23,319
- Let me see how you're
holding it.

228
00:18:23,406 --> 00:18:24,407
You gotta hold it
like that that.

229
00:18:24,494 --> 00:18:25,539
All right, right here, ready?

230
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:27,410
- Okay.

231
00:18:27,497 --> 00:18:30,805
[tennis ball thumping]

232
00:18:39,422 --> 00:18:40,162
[Scott grunts]

233
00:18:40,249 --> 00:18:40,989
- Yes!

234
00:18:41,076 --> 00:18:42,251
Nice shot, Madelin.

235
00:18:42,338 --> 00:18:44,471
[Madelin laughing]

236
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:45,907
- I've got it.

237
00:18:45,994 --> 00:18:49,650
[Meg grunts loudly]

238
00:18:49,737 --> 00:18:50,868
- [Scott] I'll get it.

239
00:18:53,088 --> 00:18:54,524
- It's okay.

240
00:18:54,611 --> 00:18:56,787
- Oh, it is really
back here, Meg.

241
00:18:56,874 --> 00:18:57,962
- Sorry.

242
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:00,530
- It's lodged deep.

243
00:19:00,617 --> 00:19:02,576
[tense music]
You know, it helps

244
00:19:02,663 --> 00:19:07,624
if you square your hips
and start low.

245
00:19:08,538 --> 00:19:10,497
Keep your eye on the ball.

246
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:13,326
Swing through all the way over.

247
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,720
- Yeah?

248
00:19:16,807 --> 00:19:18,287
- [Scott] Got it.

249
00:19:19,593 --> 00:19:20,768
- Why don't we just rally?

250
00:19:20,855 --> 00:19:23,901
Give Meg a chance to
get her bearings.

251
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,869
[paper rustling]

252
00:19:42,398 --> 00:19:47,447
[Meg breathes heavily]
[clothes rustling]

253

[footsteps thudding]

256
00:20:21,437 --> 00:20:22,699
[Meg whimpering]

257
00:20:22,786 --> 00:20:23,874
- Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg,
Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg.

258
00:20:23,961 --> 00:20:27,051
[Meg crying loudly]

259
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:28,879
[high-pitched whining]

260
00:20:28,966 --> 00:20:30,620
It's not, it's not.

261
00:20:45,113 --> 00:20:48,029
[calm vocalizing]

262
00:21:08,876 --> 00:21:10,921
- I used to count the footsteps.

263
00:21:11,008 --> 00:21:13,750
[clock ticking]

264
00:21:15,535 --> 00:21:17,101
The house was old.

265
00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:23,978
The sound carried.

266
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,993
I started counting

267
00:21:42,736 --> 00:21:44,303
how long it would
take them to get

268
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,261
to different places
in the house.

269
00:21:56,619 --> 00:22:01,668
It helped a little

270
00:22:02,973 --> 00:22:05,802
to always know how long it
would take them to get to me.

271
00:22:10,981 --> 00:22:14,071
[Scott sighs]

272
00:22:14,158 --> 00:22:16,596
[Meg sighs]

273
00:22:17,553 --> 00:22:19,947
- Dr. Potter said it
could be really helpful

274
00:22:21,035 --> 00:22:22,341
to write in your journal

275
00:22:26,736 --> 00:22:28,651
when you're having
moments like this.

276
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:44,928
Can I go get it for you?

277
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:52,545
[glass clinking]

278
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:57,071
So this is an Argentinian wine.

279
00:22:57,158 --> 00:23:00,640
It's supposed to be really
good, sort of peppery.

280
00:23:05,732 --> 00:23:06,646
Good?

281
00:23:07,908 --> 00:23:09,431
- Good.

282
00:23:09,518 --> 00:23:12,042
I dunno.

283
00:23:12,129 --> 00:23:13,870
- No, [laughs] wait,
what are you doing?

284
00:23:13,957 --> 00:23:15,829
- You hate it.
- No, I love it.

285
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,439
- And you're sure?
- Yes.

286
00:23:17,526 --> 00:23:18,701
- And you wanna drink it?
- Mm-hmm, I wanna drink it.

287
00:23:18,788 --> 00:23:20,268
- We have others.
- No, I want this one.

288
00:23:20,355 --> 00:23:21,182
[Meg laughs softly]

289
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:22,531
Put the wine down, psycho.

290
00:23:22,618 --> 00:23:25,969
[Minnow barking]
- Yoo-hoo!

291
00:23:26,056 --> 00:23:27,841
Minnow, down.

292
00:23:27,928 --> 00:23:30,713
Off.
[Minnow panting]

293
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,019
Oh.

294
00:23:32,106 --> 00:23:32,889
Hello.

295
00:23:32,976 --> 00:23:33,847
- Hello, hello, hello.

296
00:23:33,934 --> 00:23:35,109
[Madelin kisses animatedly]

297
00:23:35,196 --> 00:23:37,677
I brought chicken
and an eggplant.

298
00:23:37,764 --> 00:23:39,635
- Oh, you didn't have to.

299
00:23:39,722 --> 00:23:40,984
- Oh, my mother barely
eats anyway

300
00:23:41,071 --> 00:23:42,377
and I don't want all
this to go to waste.

301
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:44,248
Here, would you get
to work on this?

302
00:23:44,335 --> 00:23:49,166
- Oh, actually, I'm sorry,
we weren't expecting you.

303
00:23:50,516 --> 00:23:52,474
- Oh, god, so American.

304
00:23:52,561 --> 00:23:54,433
What is it, five o'clock?
[laughs]

305
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,043
- [Scott] 6:30.

306
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,262
- If you got to a restaurant
in Paris at eight o'clock,

307
00:23:58,349 --> 00:23:59,916
you'd be the first ones there.

308
00:24:00,917 --> 00:24:01,657
- You know what?

309
00:24:01,744 --> 00:24:02,484
We can have it tomorrow.

310
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:03,442
- Yeah.

311
00:24:03,529 --> 00:24:04,443
Thank you.

312
00:24:08,534 --> 00:24:11,188
[Scott sighs]

313
00:24:11,275 --> 00:24:12,929
- Well, I better be off.

314
00:24:16,977 --> 00:24:18,848
- Would you like to
stay for dinner?

315
00:24:18,935 --> 00:24:19,675
- That's a good idea.

316
00:24:19,762 --> 00:24:21,198
- No, I couldn't impose.

317
00:24:21,285 --> 00:24:22,504
- No, it's not an imposition.

318
00:24:22,591 --> 00:24:23,723
I can just set out an extra...

319
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:24,898
- Alright, well, wonderful.

320
00:24:24,985 --> 00:24:25,812
Talkie, get out the
good glasses.

321
00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:28,467
I have a surprise for you.

322
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:31,818
- Is that the family rye?

323
00:24:31,905 --> 00:24:33,863
- The last batch. [laughs]

324
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,474
- You make your own whiskey?

325
00:24:35,561 --> 00:24:36,953
- Yeah, well, our
great-grandfather-

326
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,302
- Great-great-grandfather.

327
00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:40,087
- Our great-great-grandfather
was a banker

328
00:24:40,174 --> 00:24:44,308
and a man owed him money, and
after the markets crashed,

329
00:24:44,395 --> 00:24:45,484
he couldn't pay in cash so-

330
00:24:45,571 --> 00:24:50,227
- So Pop let him pay
us in whiskey.

331
00:24:50,314 --> 00:24:53,840
- We've had a basement full
of stuff for almost a century,

332
00:24:53,927 --> 00:24:55,232
but we're almost out now.

333
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,888
- To the fall of
our great house.

334
00:25:00,063 --> 00:25:03,023
[glasses clinking]

335
00:25:08,724 --> 00:25:10,247
[Meg coughs]

336
00:25:10,334 --> 00:25:13,163
- Let me just grab the wine
and then we will be ready.

337
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,078
[Madelin chuckles]

338
00:25:15,165 --> 00:25:16,993
- Looks delicious, Talkie.

339
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,994
- Yeah.

340
00:25:22,172 --> 00:25:25,393
[silverware scraping]

341
00:25:30,746 --> 00:25:32,922
- How are things at the firm?

342
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:36,404
- Oh, yeah, I'm still on
leave through the holidays,

343
00:25:36,491 --> 00:25:40,408
but yeah, I spoke to the
partners and they
were suggesting

344
00:25:40,495 --> 00:25:42,279
a January 10th return.

345
00:25:42,366 --> 00:25:43,063
- [Madelin] Oh, that's
wonderful.

346
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,064
- What?

347
00:25:44,934 --> 00:25:45,892
- I told you that.

348
00:25:47,371 --> 00:25:52,420
- And Meg, Scotty tells
me you were an engineer.

349
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,901
- Am.

350
00:25:54,988 --> 00:25:55,989
- Hm?

351
00:25:56,076 --> 00:25:57,730
- I am an engineer.

352
00:25:57,817 --> 00:25:59,645
I'm also returning to
work in the new year.

353
00:25:59,732 --> 00:26:02,256
- Oh, that's fantastic news.

354
00:26:02,343 --> 00:26:03,910
Scotty didn't mention it.

355
00:26:03,997 --> 00:26:05,781
- Yeah, thank you.

356
00:26:05,868 --> 00:26:06,739
- When?

357
00:26:08,828 --> 00:26:10,525
When are you going back?

358
00:26:12,222 --> 00:26:14,398
- I'm not exactly sure yet.

359
00:26:14,485 --> 00:26:16,879
They're still reconfiguring
my position.

360
00:26:16,966 --> 00:26:18,359
- Of course.

361
00:26:18,446 --> 00:26:19,665
I'm sure they had to
shuffle things around a bit

362
00:26:19,752 --> 00:26:20,666
when you got back.

363
00:26:25,932 --> 00:26:27,455
- What do you do?

364
00:26:27,542 --> 00:26:29,762
- Oh, a little of this,
a little of that.

365
00:26:29,849 --> 00:26:33,026
I take care of my mother,
and then there's the land.

366
00:26:33,113 --> 00:26:35,071
That just never stops.

367
00:26:35,158 --> 00:26:37,900
- Madelin actually taught
in Korea after college.

368
00:26:37,987 --> 00:26:39,554
Meg was born in Seoul.

369
00:26:40,337 --> 00:26:41,295
- Oh!

370
00:26:41,382 --> 00:26:45,125
[speaking Korean]

371
00:26:47,823 --> 00:26:50,696
- Sorry, I don't speak Korean.

372
00:26:50,783 --> 00:26:53,350
- Oh, [laughs] don't
worry about it.

373
00:26:53,437 --> 00:26:54,961
I just asked when you left.

374
00:26:56,179 --> 00:27:00,706
- Oh, I was adopted
when I was three.

375
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:04,971
- Oh.
- Can you pass the salt?

376
00:27:05,058 --> 00:27:05,972
- Yeah.

377
00:27:08,844 --> 00:27:10,846
- So I ran into the
Harrisons at the market.

378
00:27:10,933 --> 00:27:12,108
- I heard they were selling.

379
00:27:12,195 --> 00:27:12,979
- [Scott] Indeed, they are.

380
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:15,285
[Madelin gasps]

381
00:27:15,372 --> 00:27:16,156
Their neighbors
[Minnow whimpering]

382
00:27:16,243 --> 00:27:16,983
bought the property.

383
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,506
- Uh-huh.

384
00:27:18,593 --> 00:27:19,638
- They're putting in a
pool over the entire lot.

385
00:27:19,725 --> 00:27:20,856
- [Madelin] Oh.

386
00:27:20,943 --> 00:27:21,988
- [Scott] Tearing down
the old house.

387
00:27:22,075 --> 00:27:22,989
- Stop it.

388
00:27:26,209 --> 00:27:29,735
You teach a dog to beg,
it'll never stop.

389
00:27:35,305 --> 00:27:36,306
- Pass the salad.

390
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:44,663
[water whooshing]
[plates clinking]

391
00:27:54,847 --> 00:27:57,240
- How are you guys
related again?

392
00:27:57,327 --> 00:27:58,459
- [Scott] We're cousins.

393
00:28:00,548 --> 00:28:01,680
- Like first cousins?

394
00:28:03,203 --> 00:28:04,813
- Our dads are brothers, why?

395
00:28:07,033 --> 00:28:07,903
- Nothing.

396
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:14,954
It's just

397
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:21,177
what was with Madelin
speaking in Korean to me?

398
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,791
- I think she was just
trying to connect.

399
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:31,144
- Okay, but I also have
family in Sweden.

400
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:35,017
I bet she wouldn't have tried
to speak in Swedish to me.

401
00:28:36,192 --> 00:28:39,239
- Well, I don't think she
speaks Swedish, but okay.

402
00:28:40,414 --> 00:28:42,764
[Meg sighs]

403
00:28:42,851 --> 00:28:44,374
[Scott sighs]

404
00:28:44,461 --> 00:28:46,507
Do you want me to talk
to her about it?

405
00:28:46,594 --> 00:28:48,552
- No, thank you.

406
00:28:53,209 --> 00:28:55,603
[Meg sighs]

407
00:28:56,778 --> 00:28:57,692
- I know.

408
00:29:02,349 --> 00:29:04,481
It's always made me kind
of uncomfortable,

409
00:29:06,657 --> 00:29:10,574
but I [laughs] can't control
what they put on their walls.

410
00:29:10,661 --> 00:29:11,750
- [Meg] Yeah.

411
00:29:11,837 --> 00:29:13,447
- [Scott] And it was
a long time ago.

412
00:29:16,885 --> 00:29:17,756
- But...

413
00:29:18,713 --> 00:29:19,453
[Scott sighs]

414
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,715
- What?

415
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:23,457
- Well, what did your
grandparents do

416
00:29:23,544 --> 00:29:24,850
when they were over there?

417
00:29:24,937 --> 00:29:27,374
- My great grandparents
were missionaries.

418
00:29:27,461 --> 00:29:30,420
- So they built churches and
taught people English, right?

419
00:29:31,204 --> 00:29:32,858
- Right.

420
00:29:32,945 --> 00:29:37,645
- Okay, and what did Madelin
do when she was over there?

421
00:29:37,732 --> 00:29:39,821
- Okay, she taught
at a university.

422
00:29:39,908 --> 00:29:41,170
- She taught English! [laughs]

423
00:29:41,257 --> 00:29:42,345
- It's not the same thing.

424
00:29:42,432 --> 00:29:43,738
- Really?

425
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:45,305
'Cause it feels like a
different iteration

426
00:29:45,392 --> 00:29:46,654
of the same thing to me.

427
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:50,484
[Scott sighs]

428
00:29:56,577 --> 00:29:59,362
- Well, I guess we
just disagree.

429
00:30:02,278 --> 00:30:03,845
We can disagree, right?

430
00:30:08,241 --> 00:30:09,155
- Yeah.

431
00:30:12,985 --> 00:30:13,855
- Okay.

432
00:30:15,901 --> 00:30:18,425
[Meg gasps]

433
00:30:18,512 --> 00:30:21,820
[Meg breathes shakily]

434
00:30:27,521 --> 00:30:30,089
[tense music]

435
00:30:36,486 --> 00:30:37,400
- Scott?

436
00:30:43,276 --> 00:30:44,799
[high-pitched whining]

437
00:30:44,886 --> 00:30:47,628
[slow thudding]

438
00:31:17,005 --> 00:31:19,529
[Man whistles]

439
00:31:19,616 --> 00:31:22,619
[muffled shouting]

440
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:26,797
- Hi.

441
00:31:34,501 --> 00:31:36,242
- You gotta stay below
the water line

442
00:31:36,329 --> 00:31:38,026
if you're gonna walk
around here.

443
00:31:40,681 --> 00:31:41,595
- Why?

444
00:31:42,509 --> 00:31:43,814
- It's private property.

445
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,730
- Are you a Whitman?

446
00:31:46,817 --> 00:31:47,906
[Man laughs]

447
00:31:47,993 --> 00:31:49,168
- No, I just do some
repairs for them

448
00:31:49,255 --> 00:31:50,865
in exchange for fishing rights.

449
00:31:51,997 --> 00:31:54,042
They're really uptight
about trespassing.

450
00:31:58,046 --> 00:32:02,181
- I'm actually here with
my husband, Scott Whitman.

451
00:32:04,487 --> 00:32:05,836
- Shit, sorry, I'm an idiot.

452
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:06,837
- [Meg] [laughs] No, it's fine.

453
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,404
- I didn't realize he was back.

454
00:32:08,491 --> 00:32:10,624
Yeah, the summer crowd
doesn't usually come so often

455
00:32:10,711 --> 00:32:11,886
during the off season.

456
00:32:16,282 --> 00:32:17,761
- What do you mean so often?

457
00:32:19,546 --> 00:32:22,897
- Nothing, just he was here
last winter for a while.

458
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:32,037
Hey, I'm really sorry
about what happened to you.

459
00:32:36,084 --> 00:32:37,129
- Thank you.

460
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:49,228
[tense music]

461
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:56,365
[door thuds softly]

462
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:08,290
Why have we never come out here?

463
00:33:08,377 --> 00:33:10,249
- There's just so much baggage,

464
00:33:11,076 --> 00:33:13,426
so much family stuff out here.

465
00:33:13,513 --> 00:33:15,732
I guess I'm realizing that

466
00:33:17,517 --> 00:33:19,736
it's been so long since
I've been out here.

467
00:33:22,174 --> 00:33:24,219
I'm glad we're here now.

468
00:33:30,312 --> 00:33:33,011
[coat rustling]

469
00:33:34,664 --> 00:33:37,972
[garage door rumbling]

470
00:33:39,887 --> 00:33:42,324
[wrench clicking]

471
00:33:42,411 --> 00:33:44,718
[screwdriver clicking]

472
00:33:44,805 --> 00:33:47,634
[parts rustling]

473
00:33:55,511 --> 00:33:58,123
[pencil scratching]

474
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:00,777
[tense music]

475
00:34:01,865 --> 00:34:05,347
[both breathing heavily]

476
00:34:13,312 --> 00:34:15,270
[door thuds]

477
00:34:15,357 --> 00:34:16,750
- Stay with me.

478
00:34:19,927 --> 00:34:21,014
[door thuds loudly]

479
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:23,670
[tense music]

480
00:34:25,976 --> 00:34:26,934
[door banging loudly]

481
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:30,329
[high-pitched whining]

482
00:34:50,391 --> 00:34:52,742
[high-pitched whining]

483
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:53,612
See?

484
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:55,223
Everything's fine.

485
00:35:04,493 --> 00:35:08,106
[glass clattering sharply]

486
00:35:25,514 --> 00:35:28,082
[tense music]

487
00:36:01,463 --> 00:36:04,945
[Madelin singing eerily]

488
00:36:23,616 --> 00:36:25,270
- Shit.
- Meg!

489
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:29,665
[Madelin laughing]

490
00:36:29,752 --> 00:36:32,146
Go in, go in, I'll
be right there!

491
00:36:37,717 --> 00:36:39,501
[footsteps thumping]

492
00:36:39,588 --> 00:36:42,069
It's incredible for
the immune system,

493
00:36:42,156 --> 00:36:44,463
the cold air and hot
water together.

494
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,421
I haven't been sick in years.

495
00:36:46,508 --> 00:36:48,597
- Oh, thank you.

496
00:36:48,684 --> 00:36:49,598
- Mm-hmm.

497
00:36:53,385 --> 00:36:55,735
My mother became obsessed
with oil painting

498
00:36:55,822 --> 00:36:56,953
when she got sick.

499
00:36:58,128 --> 00:36:59,913
Can't tell you how many
hours we sat like that,

500
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,044
posing for her.

501
00:37:02,698 --> 00:37:03,917
- You used to be blonde?

502
00:37:05,484 --> 00:37:06,354
- Briefly.

503
00:37:08,835 --> 00:37:10,228
- It doesn't look like you.

504
00:37:11,881 --> 00:37:13,535
- She wasn't a great painter.

505
00:37:14,406 --> 00:37:17,452
[Meg laughs softly]

506
00:37:18,758 --> 00:37:19,976
- Who's the little boy?

507
00:37:21,717 --> 00:37:22,631
- My brother.

508
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:26,069
- Your brother?

509
00:37:28,985 --> 00:37:32,250
- He died when he was
five and I was eight.

510
00:37:34,121 --> 00:37:36,036
We were swimming right
off our beach.

511
00:37:40,606 --> 00:37:41,476
- I'm sorry.

512
00:37:42,651 --> 00:37:44,262
- For most of my childhood,
I thought I dreamt

513
00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:45,393
the whole thing.

514
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,047
My parents never talked
about him.

515
00:37:47,917 --> 00:37:49,832
I don't know what possessed
my mother to paint him

516
00:37:49,919 --> 00:37:50,964
into that portrait.

517
00:37:52,705 --> 00:37:54,707
I'm not even sure it's
a good likeness.

518
00:38:04,107 --> 00:38:06,022
- I think I saw her earlier.

519
00:38:08,155 --> 00:38:09,069
- Who?

520
00:38:10,592 --> 00:38:13,552
- Your mother, walking
in the woods.

521
00:38:15,423 --> 00:38:16,772
- My mother is bedridden.

522
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,123
She hasn't left that
room in months.

523
00:38:21,516 --> 00:38:22,387
- Oh.

524
00:38:32,484 --> 00:38:34,007
How is she?

525
00:38:34,094 --> 00:38:35,008
- She's dying.

526
00:38:36,705 --> 00:38:37,576
- I'm sorry.

527
00:38:38,751 --> 00:38:41,057
- She hasn't enjoyed
life for many years.

528
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:44,452
Death will be a mercy.

529
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:47,107
[tense music]

530
00:38:49,544 --> 00:38:50,545
Coyotes.

531
00:38:52,112 --> 00:38:53,679
They can be a real menace.

532
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,121
Mm, what's that?

533
00:39:03,819 --> 00:39:05,343
- Oh, it's nothing.

534
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,822
Just a nervous habit.

535
00:39:06,909 --> 00:39:08,389
- What are you nervous about?

536
00:39:09,869 --> 00:39:11,131
- Nothing.

537
00:39:11,218 --> 00:39:12,785
- Is it all the talk of death?

538
00:39:14,264 --> 00:39:15,701
[Madelin chuckles]

539
00:39:15,788 --> 00:39:17,050
Are you afraid of dying?

540
00:39:18,965 --> 00:39:19,966
- Everyone is.

541
00:39:20,053 --> 00:39:21,054
- Not everyone.

542
00:39:22,577 --> 00:39:24,840
Some people believe we
go somewhere better.

543
00:39:26,755 --> 00:39:31,107
Other people think anywhere
is better than here.

544
00:39:39,551 --> 00:39:40,900
- May I use your bathroom?

545
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,207
- Right at the top
of the stairs.

546
00:39:53,869 --> 00:39:56,698
[low rumbling]

547
00:39:56,785 --> 00:39:57,656
- Wrong way.

548
00:39:58,874 --> 00:40:00,746
[Meg chuckles awkwardly]

549
00:40:00,833 --> 00:40:01,660
Upstairs.

550
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:07,317
[footsteps thumping]

551
00:40:10,669 --> 00:40:13,541
[low rumbling]

552
00:40:13,628 --> 00:40:14,760
[door clicks]

553
00:40:14,847 --> 00:40:17,980
[footsteps clicking]

554
00:40:19,678 --> 00:40:22,028
[door thuds]

555
00:40:22,115 --> 00:40:24,465
[garbage clattering]

556
00:40:24,552 --> 00:40:25,901
- Fuck!

557
00:40:25,988 --> 00:40:28,469
[Meg grunts]

558
00:40:35,911 --> 00:40:38,436
[tense music]

559
00:40:42,265 --> 00:40:45,878
- Yoo-hoo!
[Minnow barking]

560
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:52,188
So I steal the keys.

561
00:40:52,275 --> 00:40:53,668
- Naturally, I stole
the booze. [laughs]

562
00:40:53,755 --> 00:40:56,497
- And we get out on the
water and it's pitch black

563
00:40:56,584 --> 00:40:58,456
on the water, and I
look at Madelin,

564
00:40:58,543 --> 00:41:01,067
I hand her the keys, and that's
when we realized [laughs]

565
00:41:01,154 --> 00:41:03,809
neither of us knows how
to drive a boat.

566
00:41:03,896 --> 00:41:07,029
So we just floated for a
little while and about an hour

567
00:41:07,116 --> 00:41:10,511
into it, we realize we have
drifted well off our mooring,

568
00:41:10,598 --> 00:41:13,079
like out into the bay,
and suddenly Madelin

569
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:14,515
gets a look of confidence.

570
00:41:14,602 --> 00:41:15,864
- I mean, gin can do
that to a girl, you know?

571
00:41:15,951 --> 00:41:17,779
- And she declares, "I'm
gonna drive us back."

572
00:41:17,866 --> 00:41:19,302
- [Madelin] Yeah, and I did!

573
00:41:19,389 --> 00:41:20,956
- Well, you did,
but you drove us

574
00:41:21,043 --> 00:41:23,655
right into the neighbor's dock,
to be fair. [Madelin laughs]

575
00:41:23,742 --> 00:41:25,178
So if the boat is totaled.

576
00:41:25,265 --> 00:41:27,615
Their dock is like splinters.

577
00:41:27,702 --> 00:41:28,573
She looks at me.

578
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,312
You remember what you said?

579
00:41:29,399 --> 00:41:30,618
I'll never forget.

580
00:41:30,705 --> 00:41:32,141
[Madelin clears throat]

581
00:41:32,228 --> 00:41:33,969
- "Do you think mother will
notice the gin is gone?"

582
00:41:34,056 --> 00:41:36,798
[both laughing]

583
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,238
- I love that story.

584
00:41:42,325 --> 00:41:43,501
Oh, man.

585
00:41:43,588 --> 00:41:44,763
- So what did you do?

586
00:41:46,634 --> 00:41:47,896
- About what?

587
00:41:49,811 --> 00:41:51,030
- The boat.

588
00:41:51,117 --> 00:41:52,684
The dock.

589
00:41:52,771 --> 00:41:56,122
- [Madelin] Oh, we had it
repaired, I mean. [laughs]

590
00:41:56,209 --> 00:41:57,515
- Must have been expensive.

591
00:41:57,602 --> 00:41:58,516
- Mm-mm.

592
00:41:59,342 --> 00:42:01,519
We don't talk about money
at the dinner table.

593
00:42:08,656 --> 00:42:10,049
- But we're already talking
about money.

594
00:42:10,136 --> 00:42:12,181
- Meg, it's just a story.

595
00:42:13,574 --> 00:42:14,619
- What do you mean?

596
00:42:15,445 --> 00:42:17,535
- Well, that's what this
whole story is about.

597
00:42:18,797 --> 00:42:19,885
[Scott sighs]

598
00:42:19,972 --> 00:42:21,060
It's fine.

599
00:42:22,322 --> 00:42:23,671
I'm not saying it's bad.

600
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:25,717
I just think it's funny.

601
00:42:26,631 --> 00:42:29,329
Only rich people think it's
rude to talk about money.

602
00:42:33,028 --> 00:42:36,249
- It's interesting you don't
consider yourself rich.

603
00:42:37,729 --> 00:42:38,947
- Well, it's different.

604
00:42:40,296 --> 00:42:42,255
I didn't grow up with money.

605
00:42:42,342 --> 00:42:44,910
- But you have money now.

606
00:42:44,997 --> 00:42:48,087
- My parents' life
insurance, not a trust fund.
- Because as I understand
it, you actually have

607
00:42:48,174 --> 00:42:50,568
a good deal more money
than either Scott or me.

608
00:42:53,614 --> 00:42:55,398
I'm not saying it's bad.

609
00:42:55,485 --> 00:42:58,706
[wine sloshing]

610
00:42:58,793 --> 00:42:59,664
Just funny.

611
00:43:02,928 --> 00:43:06,235
[Meg chuckles quietly]

612
00:43:14,766 --> 00:43:16,028
This has been lovely.

613
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:19,597
I should really go check
on my mother.

614
00:43:19,684 --> 00:43:20,685
- Oh.

615
00:43:20,772 --> 00:43:22,077
- Oh, I'm sorry.

616
00:43:22,164 --> 00:43:23,122
- Yeah, I'll just...

617
00:43:23,209 --> 00:43:24,776
If you're not done, we can...

618
00:43:30,956 --> 00:43:33,001
[Meg laughs quietly]

619
00:43:33,088 --> 00:43:34,002
- I'm done.

620
00:43:34,089 --> 00:43:35,003
It's fine.

621
00:43:36,265 --> 00:43:37,397
- She'll eat it later.

622
00:43:40,313 --> 00:43:41,227
- It's fine.

623
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:47,973
- She doesn't like to eat
in front of people anymore.

624
00:43:56,242 --> 00:43:57,635
- [Madelin] You poor thing.

625
00:44:06,034 --> 00:44:08,602
[chair bangs]

626
00:44:11,431 --> 00:44:14,608
[Meg chewing loudly]

627
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:34,149
[fork clangs]

628
00:44:34,236 --> 00:44:35,150
- All done.

629
00:44:41,896 --> 00:44:44,377
[door bangs]

630
00:44:51,427 --> 00:44:53,778
[door creaking]

631
00:44:53,865 --> 00:44:56,911
[drawer rustling]

632
00:44:56,998 --> 00:44:59,871
[sheets rustling]

633
00:45:08,096 --> 00:45:11,317
So we're just not gonna
talk about it.

634
00:45:15,277 --> 00:45:17,845
[Scott sighs]

635
00:45:33,295 --> 00:45:34,644
- They poisoned your food.

636
00:45:36,037 --> 00:45:39,084
Not every time, but
enough to keep you scared.

637
00:45:42,522 --> 00:45:44,176
And I'm sorry, I don't...

638
00:45:45,786 --> 00:45:47,570
I'm sorry they did that to you.

639
00:45:54,534 --> 00:45:58,016
[Scott breathes shakily]

640
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,765
- They made me make videos.

641
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:10,506
[tense music]

642
00:46:10,593 --> 00:46:14,423
They made me beg you for help.

643
00:46:16,861 --> 00:46:17,775
- Not tonight.

644
00:46:21,169 --> 00:46:22,388
- Are you serious?

645
00:46:22,475 --> 00:46:23,432
- [Scott] I'm tired,
I'm not doing this.

646
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:24,694
- We're having a conversation.

647
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:25,695
- No, we're not!

648
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:26,653
- You can't just decide that!

649
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:29,221
[door slams]

650
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:41,537
[high-pitched whining]

651
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:09,435
[Meg breathes shakily]

652
00:47:09,522 --> 00:47:12,786
[garage door creaking]

653
00:47:14,875 --> 00:47:17,704
[parts rustling]

654
00:47:19,575 --> 00:47:21,360
[screwdriver scraping]

655
00:47:21,447 --> 00:47:23,231
[wrench clicking]

656
00:47:23,318 --> 00:47:26,365
[metallic clacking]

657
00:47:43,295 --> 00:47:46,951
[motorcycle creaking]

658
00:47:47,038 --> 00:47:48,126
[metallic clicking]

659
00:47:48,213 --> 00:47:51,129
[high-pitched whining]
[slow music]

660
00:47:51,216 --> 00:47:54,088
[engine rumbling]

661
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:24,292
[engine rumbling]

662
00:48:34,128 --> 00:48:36,696
[door creaking]

663
00:48:36,783 --> 00:48:41,831
[slow jazzy music]
[muffled singing]

664
00:48:45,139 --> 00:48:48,273
[patrons chattering]

665
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,367
[Meg clears throat]

666
00:49:00,894 --> 00:49:03,288
[Man sighs]

667
00:49:10,295 --> 00:49:11,209
- Look who it is.

668
00:49:14,908 --> 00:49:16,431
- Oh, hey.

669
00:49:20,566 --> 00:49:23,090
- Never thought I'd run
into a Whitman woman here.

670
00:49:24,613 --> 00:49:26,224
- Thanks.
- I'm not a Whitman.

671
00:49:28,095 --> 00:49:28,966
- You what?

672
00:49:31,577 --> 00:49:33,535
- I kept my last name.

673
00:49:34,406 --> 00:49:35,624
It's Rhoads.

674
00:49:39,193 --> 00:49:40,064
- I'm Joe.

675
00:49:42,327 --> 00:49:43,197
- Meg.

676
00:49:44,503 --> 00:49:45,808
- Not Whitman.

677
00:49:45,895 --> 00:49:47,288
[Meg laughs]

678
00:49:47,375 --> 00:49:48,246
- Not Whitman.

679
00:49:51,901 --> 00:49:53,947
- So how long are
you in town for?

680
00:49:55,296 --> 00:49:56,689
- Too long.

681
00:49:56,776 --> 00:49:58,082
- [Joe] You don't like it here?

682
00:49:59,953 --> 00:50:01,259
- It's a little...

683
00:50:01,346 --> 00:50:02,216
- Lonely.

684
00:50:04,262 --> 00:50:06,394
- [Meg] I was gonna
say claustrophobic.

685
00:50:06,481 --> 00:50:09,397
[Joe laughs]

686
00:50:09,484 --> 00:50:10,355
- [Joe] Thanks.

687
00:50:14,359 --> 00:50:15,795
- Hey, do you know Madelin?

688
00:50:16,578 --> 00:50:18,058
- [Joe] Madelin?

689
00:50:18,145 --> 00:50:19,973
- My husband's cousin?

690
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:21,279
- Mm.

691
00:50:21,366 --> 00:50:22,758
Oh, yeah.

692
00:50:22,845 --> 00:50:24,847
I mean, I don't know her,
but I see her around.

693
00:50:25,761 --> 00:50:27,024
- And my husband Scott.

694
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:31,376
You saw him around
too, last winter?

695
00:50:32,986 --> 00:50:34,901
- Yeah, a couple times.

696
00:50:36,859 --> 00:50:38,644
- Were they here at
the same time?

697
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,951
[Joe sighs uncomfortably]

698
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,779
- Can't you ask your
husband that?

699
00:50:46,173 --> 00:50:47,174
- I'm asking you.

700
00:50:49,611 --> 00:50:50,699
[Joe laughs]

701
00:50:50,786 --> 00:50:54,181
- Look, I'm not keeping
a calendar

702
00:50:54,268 --> 00:50:55,835
of every time I see a Whitman.

703
00:50:56,923 --> 00:50:58,359
[Meg sighs]

704
00:50:58,446 --> 00:51:00,579
- Right, sorry. [laughs]

705
00:51:00,666 --> 00:51:01,536
- [Joe] All good.

706
00:51:02,624 --> 00:51:05,845
- There's just something
off about her.

707
00:51:05,932 --> 00:51:07,325
- Madelin?

708
00:51:07,412 --> 00:51:10,763
- She's intense.

709
00:51:12,895 --> 00:51:14,288
- I can believe that.

710
00:51:14,375 --> 00:51:15,637
- [Meg] The way she smiles.

711
00:51:15,724 --> 00:51:17,161
- Mm.

712
00:51:17,248 --> 00:51:18,292
- She does it a lot.

713
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,034
- What a bitch.

714
00:51:23,123 --> 00:51:25,908
[Meg laughs]

715
00:51:25,995 --> 00:51:26,866
- [Meg] You think I'm crazy.

716
00:51:26,953 --> 00:51:27,780
- Mm-mm.

717
00:51:27,867 --> 00:51:29,347
No, no, no, no.

718
00:51:29,434 --> 00:51:31,088
- Maybe I am crazy.

719
00:51:31,175 --> 00:51:33,090
I feel fucking crazy.

720
00:51:37,659 --> 00:51:39,618
- No, really, I get it.

721
00:51:41,272 --> 00:51:42,229
In-laws are tough.

722
00:51:45,841 --> 00:51:46,842
And the Whitmans...

723
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,279
[jaunty song begins]

724
00:51:55,503 --> 00:51:57,505
Okay, stand up.

725
00:51:58,376 --> 00:51:59,246
- No.

726
00:51:59,333 --> 00:52:00,552
Wait, what were you saying?

727
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:02,031
- [Joe] Come on.

728
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:06,210
- What were you gonna say?

729
00:52:06,297 --> 00:52:09,169
- Now, this is an old
Cape Cod-ian song.

730
00:52:09,256 --> 00:52:10,127
[Meg laughs]

731
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,132
Come on, do another one.

732
00:52:15,219 --> 00:52:16,698
[both laughing]

733
00:52:19,266 --> 00:52:20,615
Do you know how to slow dance?

734
00:52:20,702 --> 00:52:21,486
- I...

735
00:52:21,573 --> 00:52:22,530
- Or waltz?

I forgot about that.

01:16:23,535 --> 01:16:25,145
- Just calm down.

1104
01:16:25,232 --> 01:16:26,146
It's okay.

1105
01:16:31,369 --> 01:16:32,500
[water trickling]

1106
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:35,547
I want you to write
this down, okay?

1107
01:16:43,686 --> 01:16:45,425
[Meg breathes shakily]

1108
01:16:45,513 --> 01:16:46,732
That's it.

1109
01:16:46,818 --> 01:16:48,473
That's a good girl.

1110
01:17:07,448 --> 01:17:10,277
[water sloshing]

1111
01:17:24,117 --> 01:17:26,903
[paper rustling]

1112
01:17:51,536 --> 01:17:54,278
[clock ticking]

1113
01:17:58,064 --> 01:18:00,893
[sheets rustling]

1114
01:18:04,592 --> 01:18:07,594
[Meg sighs softly]

1115
01:18:18,258 --> 01:18:19,172
- Scott?

1116
01:18:38,409 --> 01:18:42,848
[footsteps thudding quickly]

1117
01:18:42,934 --> 01:18:45,808
[sheets rustling]

1118
01:18:55,513 --> 01:18:57,254
[doors rattling]

1119
01:18:57,341 --> 01:19:00,213
[fabric rustling]

1120
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:02,912
Where are the keys?

1121
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:08,656
[drawer rattling]

1122
01:19:19,058 --> 01:19:21,931
[drawer rattling]

1123
01:19:25,891 --> 01:19:28,198
[rustling]

1124
01:19:33,202 --> 01:19:36,510
[Meg breathes shakily]

1125
01:19:39,252 --> 01:19:41,646
[fabric rustling]

1126
01:19:41,733 --> 01:19:45,041
[Meg breathes heavily]

1127
01:19:49,045 --> 01:19:52,352
[Meg breathes shakily]

1128
01:19:53,266 --> 01:19:56,139
[computer clicks]

1129
01:20:01,709 --> 01:20:04,495
[Meg whimpering]

1130
01:20:04,582 --> 01:20:06,410
Someone please help me.

1131
01:20:06,496 --> 01:20:07,846
[Meg breathes shakily]

1132
01:20:07,933 --> 01:20:10,153
- [Kidnapper] Talk to him.

1133
01:20:12,503 --> 01:20:13,764
- Scott, please.

1134
01:20:17,508 --> 01:20:19,727
They're gonna kill me!

1135
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:21,207
[Meg screaming]

1136
01:20:21,294 --> 01:20:23,775
[Meg crying]

1137
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:27,213
[Meg screams]
[tense music]

1138
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:30,608
[Meg breathes heavily]

1139
01:20:32,523 --> 01:20:33,437
- Minnow!

1140
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:41,314
Minnow?

1141
01:20:44,927 --> 01:20:45,841
Minnow?

1142
01:20:49,322 --> 01:20:50,236
Minnow!

1143
01:20:52,108 --> 01:20:54,980
[Meg breathes shakily]

1144
01:20:55,067 --> 01:20:56,068
[tense music]

1145
01:20:56,155 --> 01:20:58,288
My mother is bedridden.

1146
01:21:49,556 --> 01:21:50,993
[gun clicking]

1147
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:51,950
Hi, Meg.

1148
01:21:54,213 --> 01:21:56,389
I've been looking for
Minnow all night.

1149
01:21:59,827 --> 01:22:04,528
You'll help me look.

1150
01:22:04,615 --> 01:22:05,529
- Minnow?

1151
01:22:17,019 --> 01:22:18,629
Maybe we should go back.

1152
01:22:22,111 --> 01:22:23,155
- He could be hurt.

1153
01:22:41,652 --> 01:22:42,782
- What are you doing?

1154
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:47,005
Keep going.

1155
01:22:48,789 --> 01:22:51,139
- It was an accident.

1156
01:22:51,227 --> 01:22:52,880
It was an accident.

1157
01:22:54,447 --> 01:22:55,361
Please.

1158
01:22:57,668 --> 01:23:00,976
[Meg breathes shakily]

1159
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,655
[Madelin breathes shakily]

1160
01:23:35,097 --> 01:23:38,056
[loud thudding]
[Madelin grunts]

1161
01:23:38,143 --> 01:23:41,451
[Meg breathes shakily]

1162
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:04,082
[Meg grunts]
[grass rustling]

1163
01:24:05,736 --> 01:24:08,391
[low rumbling]

1164
01:24:35,505 --> 01:24:37,594
I've been thinking about
your brother.

1165
01:24:40,945 --> 01:24:42,207
It must've been awful.

1166
01:24:45,818 --> 01:24:48,431
And afterwards, your parents
wouldn't talk about it.

1167
01:24:51,303 --> 01:24:52,696
You must've been so lonely.

1168
01:24:55,916 --> 01:25:00,965
And Scott, he was
like a brother.

1169
01:25:04,664 --> 01:25:06,144
And I can understand.

1170
01:25:09,452 --> 01:25:10,714
I'm not your enemy.

1171
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:17,199
I just need to know
what happened.

1172
01:25:21,594 --> 01:25:22,769
Who hired them?

1173
01:25:25,772 --> 01:25:27,165
Was it you or was it Scott?

1174
01:25:30,907 --> 01:25:31,822
- Fuck you.

1175
01:25:33,650 --> 01:25:36,218
[tense music]

1176
01:25:44,182 --> 01:25:45,791
- What's the plan now?

1177
01:25:47,054 --> 01:25:48,534
Just kill me yourself?

1178
01:25:50,710 --> 01:25:52,712
- Why would I kill you?

1179
01:25:58,414 --> 01:25:59,675
You'll do it yourself.

1180
01:26:03,027 --> 01:26:04,898
You'll never feel normal again.

1181
01:26:06,465 --> 01:26:09,251
How could you, after
what you went through?

1182
01:26:11,427 --> 01:26:14,169
A person doesn't just recover
from something like that.

1183
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:19,739
It rewires your brain.

1184
01:26:19,826 --> 01:26:24,875
It lives in your body
now, and you'll always,

1185
01:26:26,005 --> 01:26:29,967
always feel this way,
this emptiness,

1186
01:26:38,062 --> 01:26:42,197
like you're watching your life
pass by from behind glass.

1187
01:26:43,502 --> 01:26:46,462
You'll go through the
motions and you'll know

1188
01:26:46,549 --> 01:26:51,554
when you should be happy, but
you'll never really feel it.

1189
01:26:55,079 --> 01:26:59,648
And after a while,
that'll make you bitter.

1190
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:08,048
You'll resent others for
moving on from something

1191
01:27:08,353 --> 01:27:11,791
that you can never leave behind.

1192
01:27:11,878 --> 01:27:12,791
- [Meg] Shut up.

1193
01:27:13,663 --> 01:27:18,668
- [Madelin] Eventually
you'll just be a burden.

1194
01:27:18,755 --> 01:27:19,930
- Shut up.

1195
01:27:20,017 --> 01:27:21,800
- You can make it all go away.

1196
01:27:21,888 --> 01:27:23,760
It will be a mercy.
- Shut up.

1197
01:27:23,847 --> 01:27:24,804
Shut up!

1198
01:27:24,891 --> 01:27:25,849
- [Madelin] You're broken!

1199
01:27:25,936 --> 01:27:26,893
- Shut up!

1200
01:27:26,980 --> 01:27:28,764
- You can't tell what's real-

1201
01:27:28,852 --> 01:27:30,419
- Shut up!
- And what's just

1202
01:27:30,505 --> 01:27:31,681
a symptom of your
diseased brain.
- Shut up, shut up,

1203
01:27:31,768 --> 01:27:33,987
shut up, shut up, shut up!

1204
01:27:36,380 --> 01:27:37,252
- Madelin?

1205
01:27:42,474 --> 01:27:43,344
Madelin?

1206
01:27:47,478 --> 01:27:48,350
Madelin?

1207
01:27:49,742 --> 01:27:51,353
Oh, god, Madelin!

1208
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:52,919
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

1209
01:27:53,005 --> 01:27:54,878
Madelin, Maddie, Maddie,
Maddie, Maddie.

1210
01:27:54,965 --> 01:27:56,271
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

1211
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:58,316
Are you alright?

1212
01:27:58,403 --> 01:27:59,709
- What did you do?

1213
01:28:00,579 --> 01:28:02,102
- You wanted me dead.

1214
01:28:02,189 --> 01:28:03,669
- What the fuck?

1215
01:28:03,755 --> 01:28:06,063
- You made me go
into that garage

1216
01:28:06,150 --> 01:28:07,585
so you could take my money.

1217
01:28:07,673 --> 01:28:08,848
- We have to get her
to the hospital.

1218
01:28:08,934 --> 01:28:09,849
- Because you wanted
me to be with her.

1219
01:28:09,936 --> 01:28:11,590
Meg, you have to help me, okay?

1220
01:28:11,677 --> 01:28:12,374
Help me carry her.

1221
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:13,897
- I saw the videos!

1222
01:28:13,984 --> 01:28:15,638
- I didn't do anything!

1223
01:28:19,119 --> 01:28:20,599
I don't know who took you!

1224
01:28:26,213 --> 01:28:28,215
- How am I supposed
to believe you?

1225
01:28:37,529 --> 01:28:39,314
[Scott sighs]

1226
01:28:39,401 --> 01:28:40,880
- You never will.

1227
01:28:55,982 --> 01:28:58,942
The first video was
delivered to our apartment

1228
01:29:00,030 --> 01:29:03,512
with a note while I
was still out here.

1229
01:29:05,077 --> 01:29:07,037
I didn't see it for
almost a month.

1230
01:29:12,259 --> 01:29:14,349
I thought you were dead.

1231
01:29:17,439 --> 01:29:18,962
I felt like I had killed you.

1232
01:29:21,530 --> 01:29:23,575
It was another month
before another video came,

1233
01:29:23,662 --> 01:29:28,450
and by that point, I
didn't know what to do.

1234
01:29:28,537 --> 01:29:29,799
I couldn't show the police.

1235
01:29:29,886 --> 01:29:31,670
They were already
investigating me.

1236
01:29:34,064 --> 01:29:37,675
[Scott cries softly]

1237
01:29:37,763 --> 01:29:39,330
I had already lost you, Meg.

1238
01:29:41,071 --> 01:29:42,333
I grieved for you.

1239
01:29:48,469 --> 01:29:49,906
- You grieved for me?

1240
01:29:57,914 --> 01:30:00,916
- I should've told you, I
should've told you, Meg.

1241
01:30:01,004 --> 01:30:02,266
I should've told you.

1242
01:30:02,353 --> 01:30:03,702
I'm so sorry.

1243
01:30:03,789 --> 01:30:05,008
- You grieved for me

1244
01:30:08,359 --> 01:30:09,360
for a month.

1245
01:30:09,447 --> 01:30:12,014
[tense music]

1246
01:30:13,886 --> 01:30:18,717
You grieved for me because
you missed the ransom note,

1247
01:30:18,804 --> 01:30:22,155
because you were here with her.

1248
01:30:22,242 --> 01:30:24,157
- You were already dead.

1249
01:30:24,244 --> 01:30:27,465
- I bet you liked the
attention, didn't you?

1250
01:30:29,511 --> 01:30:33,079
You liked being the handsome
widow on TV.

1251
01:30:33,166 --> 01:30:34,690
- No!

1252
01:30:34,777 --> 01:30:38,041
- Poor Scott Whitman, his
little Asian wife is dead.

1253
01:30:38,911 --> 01:30:41,087
I bet Madelin played
right along.

1254
01:30:41,174 --> 01:30:43,916
She made you feel special,
didn't she?

1255
01:30:45,396 --> 01:30:48,094
- You were already fucking dead.

1256
01:30:50,706 --> 01:30:52,272
- You're a coward.

1257
01:30:58,061 --> 01:31:00,455
[high-pitched whining]

1258
01:31:00,541 --> 01:31:01,456
Scott.

1259
01:31:07,244 --> 01:31:09,420
- I can't live like this.

1260
01:31:10,900 --> 01:31:12,728
It's too much.

1261
01:31:12,815 --> 01:31:14,904
[Meg cries quietly]

1262
01:31:14,991 --> 01:31:15,905
- Please.

1263
01:31:21,911 --> 01:31:22,955
- I'm sorry.

1264
01:31:25,741 --> 01:31:28,178
[gun clicks]

1265
01:31:28,264 --> 01:31:31,746
[loud thud]
[Scott grunts]

1266
01:31:31,834 --> 01:31:34,576
[Meg shouts]
[loud thud]

1267
01:31:34,663 --> 01:31:37,230
[Meg choking]

1268
01:31:43,672 --> 01:31:44,541
I'm sorry.

1269
01:32:04,170 --> 01:32:04,954
[Scott shouts]

1270
01:32:05,041 --> 01:32:07,609
[Meg gasping]

1271
01:32:10,394 --> 01:32:14,137
[footsteps thudding quickly]

1272
01:32:14,224 --> 01:32:18,010
[Meg breathing heavily]

1273
01:32:18,097 --> 01:32:19,011
Meg!

1274
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:22,014
Meg!

1275
01:32:23,538 --> 01:32:24,887
Get back here, Meg!

1276
01:32:24,974 --> 01:32:27,585
[gun rattling]

1277
01:32:31,807 --> 01:32:32,851
Meg, please.

1278
01:32:34,505 --> 01:32:37,377
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

1279
01:32:40,684 --> 01:32:42,818
I'm such a piece of shit.

1280
01:32:44,733 --> 01:32:47,518
I'm such a fucking asshole.

1281
01:32:47,605 --> 01:32:49,825
[tense music]

1282
01:32:49,912 --> 01:32:52,392

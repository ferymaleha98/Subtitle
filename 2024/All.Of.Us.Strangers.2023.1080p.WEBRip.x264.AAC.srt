3
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,460
Meanwhile, work goes on for the
Brits who've relocated to the Costa.

4
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,592
Running a bar in the sun
is the classic British dream.

5
00:02:31,604 --> 00:02:33,840
It can easily turn
into a nightmare,

6
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:39,020
but Gary and Cherry from Macclesfield have
made it work. The bamboo bar is a success.

7
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,780
Hello. Hello.

8
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,860
I saw you looking at me from the street.

9
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,820
I've seen you a bunch of times
coming along with your head down.

10
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,100
One day it'll be for real, that alarm.

11
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,360
We're basically the only
ones here. Can you fucking

12
00:05:10,361 --> 00:05:11,860
believe that? I mean, they
haven't got security guards yet.

13
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,280
I'm Harry.

14
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,100
Adam.

15
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,180
Hey.

16
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,560
How do you cope?

17
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,300
- With... what?
- I said.

18
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,840
It's so quiet. I mean, London's out
there, but we can't even fuck your thing.

19
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:57,540
I play music right, but it's worse when it
ends. And I even got one of those, um...

20
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,655
uh, wide noise
machines right. But it's like

21
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:02,136
there's someone in
the corner of the room

22
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,154
whispering about me. I
mean, we can't even open

23
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:08,300
the windows, but I guess

24
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:08,960
you don't really
want us to jump.

25
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,141
It's hard for business, you know.

26
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,360
Bodies broken on the concrete.

27
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,800
I mean, who's gonna move in then?

28
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,380
Drink?

29
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,280
It's Japanese.

30
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,720
It's meant to be the best in the
world, but I couldn't tell you why, so...

31
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,640
No, thanks.

32
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,840
Okay, um...

33
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,921
Okay, how about I come in anyway?

34
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,480
If not for a drink, then...

35
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,561
for whatever else you might want.

36
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,591
I think that's a good idea.

37
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,800
Do I scare you?

38
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,900
No.

39
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,241
Well, you don't have to do
anything if I'm not your type.

40
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:07,930
Hi.

41
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,740
Hi.

42
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,750
I, uh, thought someone was strong.

43
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:10,810
Run out like this.

44
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,140
No, thanks.

45
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,060
Shall we go?

46
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,500
Go where?

47
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,060
She's gonna be over the moon to see you.

48
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,621
Guess who I found
later and in the park?

49
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,960
Is it him?

50
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:54,850
Oh, yeah, it's definitely him.

51
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,100
Look in his eyes.

52
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,400
Yes, it is you.

53
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,580
Hi.

54
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,600
Hi.

55
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,120
Don't just stand there.

56
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,160
Get yourself inside.

57
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,380
Is that where you live in there?

58
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,460
Not around here, I'm sure.

59
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,120
I'm in London.

60
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,160
Oh, how fancy.

61
00:15:20,465 --> 00:15:21,680
Do you live by yourself?

62
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,120
Do you own your own place?

63
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,340
Uh, yeah, it's just a flat.

64
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,560
What did I tell you?

65
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,840
What did I tell you?

66
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,396
I told you he'd be doing
well for himself, didn't I?

67
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,180
Can't be cheap,

68
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,520
living up there in the smoke.

69
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,776
And what is it that
you do?

70
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,380
I'm a writer.

71
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,700
And what did I tell you?

72
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,480
No, no, no, I'm not
particularly rich or anything.

73
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,180
Not really.

74
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,360
No, I always knew you'd be creative.

75
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,520
What kind of writer are you?

76
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,620
You know how I love Stephen King,

77
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,120
Carrie, Cujo, different seasons.

78
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,676
No, no, no, I'm not a proper writer.

79
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,940
I write scripts for film,

80
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,400
TV when I have to.

81
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,300
A writer.

82
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,620
God, this is so bloody exciting.

83
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,521
If I knew the neighbours, I'd run
over and I'd tell them right now.

84
00:16:06,545 --> 00:16:10,281
I've always said that writers know less
about the real world than almost anyone else.

85
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,660
What the hell would you know?

86
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,476
You could barely write joined up.

87
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,500
It's true.

88
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,620
A writer.

89
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,300
Our son.

90
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,400
We're very bloody pleased
to see you doing so well, then.

91
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,860
Here.

92
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,020
Look at that puffy shirt.

93
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,240
Our boy's back home.

94
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,020
What are you putting
on?

95
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,700
Oh, you'll see.

96
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,240
Oh.

97
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,420
Oh, do you remember your
little red car that you had?

98
00:16:48,785 --> 00:16:50,600
You loved it and you wanted to take it

99
00:16:50,601 --> 00:16:52,921
out onto the main road and
drive it with all the big cars.

100
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,236
It's my first memory, actually.

101
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,100
It was a Ford Granada that
hit him, wasn't it? No, it was.

102
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,560
It was racing green.

103
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,920
Do you remember that?

104
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,340
Mmm.

105
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:02,900
It was a red dog.

106
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,756
You went so high up in
there, I'll never forget it.

107
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:05,916
Oh, but you were fine, though.

108
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,661
You were fine. You had a couple of bruises.

109
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,756
I think they thought I was
exaggerating when I took you in.

110
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,240
What about that one
bonfire night when you lost it?

111
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,220
Remember that bonfire night?

112
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,560
How old were you?
Six? No, he was not.

113
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,900
He was older than that.

114
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,280
The fireworks went off.

115
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,440
Poor boy, he started screaming and howling.

116
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,816
Had to carry him all the way home.

117
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,380
He did? Yeah.

118
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,940
Fell asleep on my shoulder.

119
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,580
You don't remember that?

120
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,240
You were really beside yourself.

121
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,576
You were really having a hard time.

122
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,540
And we were just trying to
get you to enjoy the fireworks.

123
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,700
You've always been a sensitive boy.

124
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,880
Yeah.

125
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,220
Are you still afraid of fireworks now?

126
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:42,860
No.

127
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,896
Do you know what you said about him?

128
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,040
Is that just like my
mother?

129
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,440
He does.

130
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,560
He did say something, though.

131
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,900
Yeah, it's when he speaks to me.

132
00:17:50,901 --> 00:17:51,901
I don't know.

133
00:17:52,100 --> 00:18:06,220
It's been so bloody
lovely to see you again.

134
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,630
Aren't you sure we ever would?

135
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:09,500
No.

136
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,820
Here you are.

137
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,600
Here I am.

138
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,010
Come back soon, hm?

139
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,160
One of us will be in.

140
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,340
Please.

141
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:30,710
Yeah, I will.

142
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,110
I will.

143
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,250
What's going on?

144
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,350
Good night, sweetheart.

145
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,530
Good night, son. Bye.

146
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,530
I'm really sorry about the other night.

147
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,960
Oh, it's all right.

148
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,500
Don't worry about it.

149
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:55,680
See ya.

150
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,140
See ya.

151
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,170
I actually do like whiskey.

152
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:02,140
Do you want to
have a drink, or?

153
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,040
Hi.

154
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,900
Hi.

155
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,460
Do you want to come in?

156
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,540
Sure.

157
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,220
Yeah.

158
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,440
What have you got?

159
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,920
I've got vodka and some beer.

160
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,200
And some weed, if you prefer.

161
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:41,940
Yeah.

162
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,100
Weed's better.

163
00:22:43,525 --> 00:22:44,525
I'm off alcohol.

164
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:53,810
Do you like living here?

165
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,566
I think I like it more when people move in.

166
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,590
If people move in.

167
00:22:58,530 --> 00:22:59,650
Have you got friends nearby?

168
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,900
No.

169
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,940
Not really.

170
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,200
Do you? No, not really.

171
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,060
Most of my friends have
moved out of London.

172
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:13,220
They want to have gardens for their kids.

173
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:15,881
They want to be near their grandparents
so they can look after their kids.

174
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,840
I'm guessing you didn't
want to move too?

175
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,580
Uh, no.

176
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,940
What am I going to do in Dorking?

177
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:30,060
It's not for people like me.

178
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,780
I'm just checking you
are queer, right?

179
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,040
Yeah.

180
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,480
That's good.

181
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,120
Or gay.

182
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,360
Queer, I'm not.

183
00:23:48,361 --> 00:23:50,700
I get used to calling myself queer.

184
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,980
It was always such an insult.

185
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,810
That's probably why we
hate gay so much now.

186
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,600
I mean, it was always like...

187
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,760
Your haircut's gay.

188
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,880
The sofa's gay.

189
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,220
Your trainers are gay.

190
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,300
Your school bag's gay.

191
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,380
Yeah.

192
00:24:08,381 --> 00:24:09,381
Yeah.

193
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,400
Queer does feel polite somehow, though.

194
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,600
You know, it's like, um...

195
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,520
I don't know.

196
00:24:17,615 --> 00:24:19,535
It's like all the
dick-sucking's been taken out.

197
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,600
Yeah.

198
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:25,650
I'm assuming you're not with anyone.

199
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,060
Never see you with anyone.

200
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,740
No.

201
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,780
No.

202
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,180
You often single?

203
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,720
Am I often single?

204
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,900
Mm-hmm.

205
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,380
I suppose so, yeah.

206
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,600
Mm.

207
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:44,720
Are you?

208
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,980
Yeah.

209
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,280
Yeah.

210
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,310
But not for want of trying.

211
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:10,330
How about I kiss you?

212
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,130
No, wait.

213
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,430
Mm.

214
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:02,650
Sorry.

215
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:04,530
You all right? No, yeah, yeah.

216
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,270
Just haven't done...

217
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,270
Haven't done this in a while.

218
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,390
Just remember to breathe.

219
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:11,670
Okay.

220
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:14,950
Okay.

221
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:15,950
You all right?

222
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:17,190
Uh-huh.

223
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,360
Is this you?

224
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,340
I'm afraid it is.

225
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,940
Man, you were cute.

226
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,180
I hate my photos.

227
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,780
I was a fat kid.

228
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:55,880
Right?

229
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:59,621
But when you're a fat kid, no one
asks why you don't have a girlfriend.

230
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,880
Mm.

231
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,960
We'd have been friends for sure, though.

232
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,520
Bunked off football to spy on the boys.

233
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,420
Is this your dad?

234
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,260
Yeah.

235
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,480
He's handsome.

236
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,680
Yeah.

237
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:22,540
I'm...

238
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:24,450
I'm trying to write about
him at the moment.

239
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,720
Is that what you do?

240
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,780
Yeah.

241
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,080
How's it going?

242
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,660
Uh...

243
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,920
Strangely.

244
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:35,800
I don't see my dad much.

245
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,700
Do you, uh...

246
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,460
Do you see yours,
though?

247
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,190
No, they died.

248
00:29:44,025 --> 00:29:45,025
Just before I was 12.

249
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,300
Both of them? Yeah.

250
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,180
Yeah.

251
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,040
Yeah.

252
00:29:50,465 --> 00:29:55,470
Not the most original of deaths.

253
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:01,830
I'm really sorry.

254
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,530
No, thanks.

255
00:30:03,531 --> 00:30:04,531
It was a long time ago.

256
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,060
Yeah, I don't think that matters.

257
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,570
I'd like to see you again.

258
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:23,490
Yeah, okay.

259
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,050
I could stay the night if you...

260
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:31,860
How about actually
better idea?

261
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,820
Not tonight.

262
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,380
Yeah?

263
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,760
No, no, I would like to see you again.

264
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,840
You don't need to explain.

265
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,500
Okay.

266
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,620
Okay.

267
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,780
Thanks.

268
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:12,570
Sweetheart, you came back.

269
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:13,870
Of course I came back.

270
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:15,230
Jesus, you're sodden.

271
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,020
Come on, take it all off.

272
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,500
No, I'm not taking my clothes off.

273
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:19,630
Don't be silly.

274
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,330
It's only me.

275
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:21,390
Come on, arms up.

276
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,190
I'll put them in the dryer.

277
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:25,750
It's just me today.

278
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:26,850
Is that all right?

279
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:28,670
Yeah, of course it is.

280
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:29,010
Good.

281
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,530
There's so much I want to know.

282
00:31:30,531 --> 00:31:31,170
I want to hear everything.

283
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:31,950
Right, go on, upstairs.

284
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,130
Get changed.

285
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,280
My goodness, this is so exciting.

286
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,746
I suppose nothing's going to
fit you anymore, is it? Nope.

287
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:48,190
Yeah, well, I bought you some
of your dad's things instead.

288
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:48,610
Okay.

289
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:52,310
Oh, look, come on, take these off as well,
and I'll put them in to dry with the rest.

290
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:55,870
Uh... Oh, will you take
them off, Adam?

291
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:58,730
Honestly.

292
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,700
God, look at you.

293
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,540
What?

294
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,100
You're just a boy.

295
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:19,610
And now you're not.

296
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,980
You're totally different,
but it's still you.

297
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,740
Well, I thought you'd be hairier.

298
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,860
Like your dad.

299
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:37,650
Okay, sorry.

300
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:41,830
Like a hairy chest myself.

301
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,500
Okay.

302
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,510
Christ, you know who you remind me of?

303
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,400
Uh, who?

304
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:54,960
You look just like my dad.

305
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,700
Did he?

306
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:58,940
Mm.

307
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:01,770
I remember him anyway
when I was a little girl.

308
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,720
God, isn't that mad?

309
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:08,860
It's like seeing you both
at exactly the same time.

310
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,960
Oh.

311
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:16,740
I've made your favorite.

312
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,320
Well, I hope it's still your favorite.

313
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,460
I'll just go and pop the kettle on,
and then you can tell me everything.

314
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:52,410
Don't be afraid.

315
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:53,610
Okay.

316
00:34:54,095 --> 00:34:55,450
Now, your dad told me not to ask,

317
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,946
and I don't see a wedding
ring, so I'm presuming

318
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,171
you're not married, but
have you got a girlfriend?

319
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:02,450
Hmm?

320
00:35:03,305 --> 00:35:06,450
I'm picturing her with brown hair,
not too skinny, smart, obviously.

321
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:12,930
Well?

322
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:16,430
Well, what?

323
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,110
Do you?

324
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:22,811
I don't have a girlfriend, no.

325
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:24,430
Oh.

326
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,590
That's a shame.

327
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,120
I don't have a girlfriend
because I'm not into girls.

328
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,620
Into women.

329
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,880
What do you mean?

330
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,020
I mean...

331
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,720
I'm gay.

332
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,700
As in homosexual?

333
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,220
As in that, yeah.

334
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,360
Really?

335
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,680
Yeah.

336
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,040
Since when?

337
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,560
Since a long time.

338
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,580
Forever?

339
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,080
You don't look gay.

340
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:08,711
Well, I'm not sure what that means.

341
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,060
It means what it means.

342
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,080
You know what it means.

343
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:21,101
Well, I bet you're glad you
don't know the neighbors now.

344
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,200
Hmm.

345
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,681
I must admit, I'm a bit surprised.

346
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:28,171
I'm not really sure what I feel about it.

347
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,040
What?

348
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,920
You didn't think it would be a possibility?

349
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,460
No, of course not.

350
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:35,831
What parent wants to
think that about their child?

351
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:43,720
Well, I'm very okay with it, so...

352
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,121
Well, I'm very okay with it, so...
Aren't people nasty to you?

353
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:47,820
No, no.

354
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,520
Things are different now.

355
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,430
Well, they aren't nasty.

356
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,160
Not allowed, anyway.

357
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,630
But does everybody know?

358
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,480
I mean, are you open about it?

359
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,200
I mean, I don't know,
down the high street at W.A.

360
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:02,380
Smith's? Well, it
depends on the street.

361
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,300
Yeah.

362
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,961
Everybody knows. Everyone's fine.

363
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:09,876
Well, don't you want to
get married and have kids?

364
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,240
Well, don't you want to
get married and have kids?

365
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,260
I can have kids.

366
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,580
Men can marry.

367
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,920
Women, too.

368
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:16,580
What, to each other?

369
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,180
Yeah.

370
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,800
Why?

371
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,260
What do you mean, why?

372
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,740
Well, isn't that like having
your cake and eating it?

373
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,051
So, do you want to get married
and have kids?

374
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:31,050
I don't know.

375
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,450
It wasn't a possibility
for such a long time,

376
00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:36,431
so I didn't think it was worth the effort
of wanting to get married and have kids.

377
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,060
You okay?

378
00:37:54,061 --> 00:37:55,280
Mm, fine.

379
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,600
Sure?

380
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:04,381
I suppose I never did know what was
going on in that odd little head of yours.

381
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,056
You were always running away.

382
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,080
Do you remember?

383
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,040
Yeah.

384
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:16,100
It was that time that you
got as far as the train station,

385
00:38:16,475 --> 00:38:18,780
but then you'd lost your money,
and so you couldn't buy a ticket.

386
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,380
Do you remember that?

387
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,800
Yeah.

388
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,416
It was Granny's five pound note.

389
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,440
Yeah, that was it.

390
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:26,951
Where were you hoping
to go?

391
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:31,590
I don't know.

392
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,170
London.

393
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,480
London?

394
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:46,906
Or there was that time that you got
as far as the bottom of the garden,

395
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:49,690
but then you cut your
thumb on an old milk

396
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:51,550
bottle, and you came
running back up all sheepish,

397
00:38:51,695 --> 00:38:53,670
blood all over your shirt, and
you were banging and banging

398
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,846
on that window to be let in.

399
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:55,870
Yeah.

400
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,230
There it is.

401
00:38:58,650 --> 00:38:59,650
Just.

402
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:00,310
Yeah.

403
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:01,450
Hmm.

404
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:05,560
They say it's a very lonely kind of life.

405
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,230
They don't actually say that anymore.

406
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:14,670
So you're not lonely?

407
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:20,091
If I am, it's not because I'm gay.

408
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,860
Not really.

409
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,020
Not really?

410
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,641
Oh, God, and what about
this awful, ghastly disease?

411
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,341
I've seen the adverts on the,

412
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:40,430
on the news and with the gravestone.

413
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:41,690
Should I be worried
about that?

414
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:43,590
No. Jesus.

415
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,631
Everything is different now.

416
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,260
Everything is different.

417
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,371
Well, I guess I wouldn't know about that.

418
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,021
Your clothes will be dry now.

419
00:40:15,195 --> 00:40:16,540
You can take these
flapjacks with you if you want.

420
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,560
I won't be eating them.

421
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:02,950
What's wrong?

422
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:05,890
Um, I'm okay.

423
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:09,870
Just, just got a bit of a chill.

424
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:12,310
Really?

425
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,550
You're hot.

426
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:14,630
Yeah.

427
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:16,790
I was just, I was just,

428
00:41:17,415 --> 00:41:18,690
I just got caught in the rain.

429
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:20,370
Okay.

430
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:22,510
Well, why don't I run you a hot bath?

431
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:25,870
My nan says there's literally
nothing a hot bath can solve.

432
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:27,450
I don't really like baths.

433
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:28,110
Fuck off.

434
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:29,690
Who doesn't like baths?

435
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:33,071
You don't need to be shy around me.

436
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:34,850
Yes.

437
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,501
That's easier said than done.

438
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,866
Would you like me to
close my eyes? Yes, please.

439
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:48,890
Better.

440
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,441
I've been thinking about
who you all eat today.

441
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,120
Hmm.

442
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:07,171
I was thinking about watching
crappy TV with you on a Friday night.

443
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,660
Mm-hmm.

444
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,280
Eating takeaway on your sofa.

445
00:42:15,205 --> 00:42:18,100
Watching old episodes of Top of
the Pops from before I was born.

446
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,541
Thought about something else, too.

447
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:28,491
Thought about fucking you.

448
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:30,940
Really?

449
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,200
Yeah.

450
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:34,920
You fucking me, I don't really care which.

451
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,640
Lean to that.

452
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:42,980
Yeah.

453
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:44,760
It's okay if you're not real.

454
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,020
Don't need to be into fucking.

455
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:48,080
I wasn't for the longest time.

456
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:49,990
For obvious reasons.

457
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,340
Obvious reasons?

458
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,521
I felt that if I fucked
anyone,

459
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,320
I'd die.

460
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,801
It's probably pretty
difficult for you to imagine.

461
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:03,910
Yeah.

462
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:05,150
Well, not all.

463
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:35,430
Yeah.

464
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:49,781
You said the other day you
don't see your dad much.

465
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:51,990
Yeah.

466
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,020
How about your mom?

467
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,080
Yeah, sick.

468
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,080
How come?

469
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:04,260
They know you're queer?

470
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:05,420
Yeah, of course.

471
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:09,510
Are you okay with this?

472
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:10,820
Yeah.

473
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,720
Okay.

474
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,600
Probably less okay than
everyone's meant to be.

475
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:20,820
Yeah.

476
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,101
Never got used to it, sort of.

477
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:24,520
Just don't say too much.

478
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:29,430
You could say that I have

479
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:33,330
drifted to the edge.

480
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:36,831
Or right up to the edge, almost.

481
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:38,790
Over the edge.

482
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,180
What's that mean?

483
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:45,891
Yeah, I'm the edge of the family.

484
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:49,560
My sister and her kids.

485
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,160
My older brother just got married.

486
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:57,640
They've all got this spot in the center.

487
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:01,660
That's okay.

488
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,400
Why is it okay?

489
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:11,380
Because.

490
00:45:12,935 --> 00:45:14,400
I don't go home much.

491
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:19,430
Does that make you sad?

492
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:20,630
Yeah.

493
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:24,090
Um...

494
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,181
No, I think it's just inevitable, really.

495
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:31,180
Why?

496
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,600
Um...

497
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,480
I've always felt like a
stranger in my own family.

498
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,720
And then...

499
00:45:49,685 --> 00:45:51,740
coming out just puts
an end to that difference.

500
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:52,880
It's always been there.

501
00:45:52,881 --> 00:45:53,881
Yeah.

502
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:58,840
It's only endless.

503
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:01,731
It's not really anyone's fault.

504
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:17,460
What's wrong?

505
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:23,900
It's funny.

506
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:29,511
Things are better now. Of course they are.

507
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:38,020
It doesn't take much to
make you feel the way you felt.

508
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,640
Back there again. It's game over.

509
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,140
Am I still hot?

510
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:58,500
It's a little.

511
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:18,850
You gonna stay the night?

512
00:48:05,865 --> 00:48:06,946
I'm sure she won't be long.

513
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:09,280
It's okay.

514
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,420
I just wanted to talk to her.

515
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:12,980
Yeah, I know you did.

516
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:16,780
This was your granddad's favorite.

517
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:20,920
I never really liked it
much at the time, but...

518
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,240
it's grown on me.

519
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:26,116
If you want to see
your mom really lose her

520
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:27,620
shit, go ahead and
break that bloody thing.

521
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Ugh.

522
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:31,600
Come on then, lads.

523
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:32,620
Sit yourself down.

524
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,080
What she told you then?

525
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,840
Scared you wouldn't come back.

526
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:53,160
But you know what your mom's like.

527
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,960
Don't be too disappointed in her.

528
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,440
No, I'm not.

529
00:48:58,230 --> 00:48:59,800
She just needs to
rearrange some things in her

530
00:48:59,801 --> 00:49:01,401
head and all the
stories that she's built up.

531
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,341
She'll soon realize it's
not actually about her.

532
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:12,010
What about you?

533
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:15,230
What about me?

534
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:16,750
What do you think?

535
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:20,210
Well...

536
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:21,811
I mean, it was only a shock.

537
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:25,010
I always knew you
were a bit

538
00:49:25,011 --> 00:49:26,011
tutti-frutti.

539
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:29,810
Couldn't throw a ball for shit no matter
how many times I tried to teach her.

540
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,050
Couldn't do it.

541
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:33,971
You make me sound like a horrible cliche.

542
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:35,156
Well, can you throw
a ball?

543
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:35,790
Not at all.

544
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:36,890
Well, there you go.

545
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,721
Would you have liked me
to have known?

546
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:51,090
I don't know.

547
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:53,810
I would hear you
crying in your room

548
00:49:53,811 --> 00:49:54,811
after school.

549
00:49:57,370 --> 00:49:58,491
Did the boys bully you then?

550
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:02,150
Not just the boys.

551
00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:04,390
What would they do?

552
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:08,070
Oh, call me a girl.

553
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:10,650
Ignore me.

554
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:11,750
Refuse to play with me.

555
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:13,430
Stick my head down the toilet.

556
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:16,030
Flick drawing pens in my face.

557
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:17,530
Exactly.

558
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:19,850
Yeah.

559
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:21,050
Yeah.

560
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:25,091
Gives you a little
cancer, doesn't it?

561
00:50:34,855 --> 00:50:36,951
So why didn't you come into
my room if you heard me crying?

562
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:40,131
Why didn't you tell me what
was happening at school?

563
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:42,910
You know, you answer me

564
00:50:42,911 --> 00:50:43,911
first.

565
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:45,910
Be honest.

566
00:50:48,885 --> 00:50:50,170
I just didn't want to
think of you as the

567
00:50:50,171 --> 00:50:51,531
kind of boy that the
other lads would pick on.

568
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:55,231
And I knew that if I was at your school
I'd probably have picked on you too.

569
00:50:57,930 --> 00:50:58,930
Yeah, I think I always

570
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,801
probably thought that anyway.

571
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:06,451
Probably why I didn't tell you
what was happening to me at school.

572
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:21,341
You know, when she told me

573
00:51:23,395 --> 00:51:25,091
it did make me think about
other jokes that we make.

574
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:31,361
Yeah, well, we did impressions
of your English teacher when he

575
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,881
mints around with his limp wrist.

576
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:36,460
You told me not to cross my legs

577
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,320
like a woman over and
over

578
00:51:38,321 --> 00:51:39,321
and over again.

579
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:44,610
Did I?

580
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:48,800
Yeah, I still.

581
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:50,720
I still think about it

582
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:51,911
every time I cross my legs.

583
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:02,300
I have good memories too.

584
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:03,640
Yeah, I hope so.

585
00:52:04,095 --> 00:52:05,760
I hope so. I hope you did.

586
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,480
Ha, ha.

587
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,841
Remember you used to
love decorating the tree?

588
00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:17,990
You went crazy
for it

589
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:19,050
every year.

590
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:21,520
And you'd always let me

591
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,121
put the fairy on top of the tree.

592
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,320
I did.

593
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:47,321
Sorry I never came in your
room when you were crying.

594
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:48,460
No, really, it's okay.

595
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,561
It's not good, really,
is it? Dad, I get it.

596
00:52:50,925 --> 00:52:53,460
It was so long.

597
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:55,840
It was so long ago.

598
00:52:55,841 --> 00:52:56,940
Stop.

599
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:10,470
Can I hug you now?

600
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:12,820
Yeah, please.

601
00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:24,890
You're all right, son.

602
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:26,870
You're all right.

603
00:53:58,540 --> 00:53:59,540
After this,

604
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,400
I want to go out.

605
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,280
You and me.

606
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,220
I mean...

607
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,400
Together.

608
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,260
Into the world.

609
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:50,480
Where'd you get this?

610
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:51,540
Out of my wallet.

611
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,081
Fuck knows all that's been there.

612
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,000
I think that's cat bead.

613
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:06,500
Oh, really?

614
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:08,120
Have you done it before?

615
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:09,760
No.

616
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:11,880
You gave it back to me.

617
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:13,340
I did my best.

618
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:14,160
Okay.

619
00:56:14,161 --> 00:56:15,161
Okay.

620
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,180
Adam?

621
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:38,820
What's wrong?

622
01:00:41,650 --> 01:00:42,650
Oh, you're really hot.

623
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:44,180
Oh, he's really hot.

624
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:45,740
Huh?

625
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:50,650
Here you go.

626
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,561
Squeeze in, squeeze in, squeeze in.

627
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:20,350
All those lonely, lonely times.

628
01:01:21,585 --> 01:01:24,250
And I guess I never told you.

629
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:27,610
I'm so happy that you're mine.

630
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:32,170
If I made you feel the second best.

631
01:01:33,005 --> 01:01:35,510
I'm so sorry I was blind.

632
01:01:36,890 --> 01:01:39,530
You were always on my mind.

633
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:46,720
Tell me.

634
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,800
Tell me that you're sweet like a diamond.

635
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:51,160
Love is undying.

636
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,320
Give me

637
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:58,100
one more chance to keep you satisfied.

638
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,400
Satisfied.

639
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:01,900
Satisfied.

640
01:02:01,901 --> 01:02:02,120
Bye-bye.

641
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:11,140
Okay, get together.

642
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,280
Yeah, you ready?

643
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:14,960
Okay, let's go.

644
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:16,860
Merry Christmas.

645
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:41,860
Is this real?

646
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:45,660
Does it feel real?

647
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:48,420
Yeah.

648
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:50,520
There you go then.

649
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:54,570
For how long, though?

650
01:02:55,485 --> 01:02:56,485
I can't answer that.

651
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:02,601
I suppose we don't get
to decide when it's over.

652
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:11,311
You're not going out now, are you?

653
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:12,860
Where would we go?

654
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:14,820
The Walsh's.

655
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:16,380
The Walsh's? The Walsh's.

656
01:03:19,180 --> 01:03:19,920
The Walsh's.

657
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:19,940
No, no.

658
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:22,120
Wait.

659
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:24,320
Promise me you're not going to go out now.

660
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:25,660
I promise.

661
01:03:26,505 --> 01:03:28,120
We're just going to be asleep next door.

662
01:03:33,330 --> 01:03:34,330
Right?

663
01:03:35,950 --> 01:03:36,950
Get some sleep.

664
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:06,060
I can't sleep.

665
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:14,380
Do you want to get in?

666
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:17,940
Can I?

667
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,120
Of course you can.

668
01:04:41,370 --> 01:04:42,780
It still smells the same in here.

669
01:04:46,490 --> 01:04:49,051
You'd creep in here night after
night saying you couldn't sleep.

670
01:04:51,170 --> 01:04:52,531
You're always scared of something.

671
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:59,700
Murderers breaking in,
or rabies, or nuclear war.

672
01:05:02,015 --> 01:05:03,160
Do people still get rabies?

673
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:05,620
No.

674
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:12,951
I was desperate for you to grow up
just so I could get a good night's sleep.

675
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:18,880
Sorry.

676
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:21,750
What are you sorry for?

677
01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:25,950
I'm the sorry one.

678
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:30,861
I should have relished
you driving me bananas.

679
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:47,960
Where did you go?

680
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:51,550
You know, afterwards.

681
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:55,220
Lived with Granny.

682
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:57,500
She took me to Dublin.

683
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Yeah, I thought so.

684
01:06:01,505 --> 01:06:02,811
Why didn't you live with his slop?

685
01:06:02,835 --> 01:06:04,276
Why didn't you live with Granny May?

686
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:07,511
They said she was too heartbroken.

687
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,200
About what?

688
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:11,720
Well, she'd lost her son.

689
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:15,321
Oh, I see. But my mother was
fine about losing her only daughter.

690
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:16,360
No, no.

691
01:06:18,570 --> 01:06:19,570
She was not fine.

692
01:06:21,370 --> 01:06:22,980
I just can't believe that she
got to look after you and I didn't.

693
01:06:27,830 --> 01:06:29,151
Are any of them still around now?

694
01:06:33,430 --> 01:06:34,591
They wouldn't be, would they?

695
01:06:37,050 --> 01:06:38,771
And how did you get on over there with Mum?

696
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:42,821
Did you manage to fit in better at school?

697
01:06:46,050 --> 01:06:47,050
I made sure I did.

698
01:06:54,715 --> 01:06:57,396
I hate that we weren't around when
you needed to smoke, sweetheart.

699
01:07:01,195 --> 01:07:02,195
And I hate even more

700
01:07:02,410 --> 01:07:04,171
that I wasn't there before then.
Not really.

701
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:05,680
No, that's not true.

702
01:07:05,681 --> 01:07:06,681
Oh, come on.

703
01:07:06,930 --> 01:07:08,440
I was hardly mother of a year, was I?

704
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,200
But I like to think that I
would have got better at it

705
01:07:13,201 --> 01:07:14,201
in time.

706
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:16,960
In no given time.

707
01:07:21,770 --> 01:07:23,051
You know, when I was a teenager,

708
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:25,180
or even later,

709
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:27,120
into my twenties,

710
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:29,840
I used to plot it all out.

711
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:31,920
Do you mean?

712
01:07:35,110 --> 01:07:36,640
What we might have done together.

713
01:07:39,455 --> 01:07:40,540
In intricate detail.

714
01:07:41,110 --> 01:07:42,380
Trips to the Witt Gift Centre.

715
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:45,280
Birthdays.

716
01:07:45,550 --> 01:07:46,840
You know, trips to London.

717
01:07:48,510 --> 01:07:49,510
The planetarium.

718
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:51,400
The London Dungeon.

719
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:52,760
Oh, I always wanted to go there.

720
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:54,650
I know.

721
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:59,640
Or holidays that we might
have gone on together.

722
01:08:00,030 --> 01:08:01,350
Oh, did we make it
to Disneyland?

723
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:02,420
We did.

724
01:08:02,930 --> 01:08:03,930
When I was fourteen.

725
01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:06,440
It rained non-stop.

726
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:09,240
And they shut down Space Mountain.

727
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,120
And we fought every day.

728
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:14,180
Why did we have to fight?

729
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,480
Because that's what
everyone did with their parents.

730
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:21,620
They fought and bickered and pretended
that they were ruining each other's lives.

731
01:08:24,630 --> 01:08:25,630
Did we make up?

732
01:08:28,295 --> 01:08:29,496
No, we didn't need to make up.

733
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:32,460
We were together.

734
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,040
We were together.

735
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:35,420
So...

736
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:38,280
Is that it, Mum?

737
01:08:45,490 --> 01:08:46,490
You okay?

738
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:51,380
No.

739
01:08:52,270 --> 01:08:53,270
You're okay, son.

740
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:04,680
You're okay.

741
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:09,960
What are you doing here?

742
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:11,340
You're not supposed to be here.

743
01:11:37,070 --> 01:11:39,090
What day is it? Sunday.

744
01:11:39,830 --> 01:11:44,840
What day?

745
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:47,140
You kept screaming out for your parents

746
01:11:47,415 --> 01:11:48,820
over and over again in the club.

747
01:11:48,965 --> 01:11:51,960
And I didn't know what to do.

748
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:52,980
So I just...

749
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:56,680
took you back here and
there until you fell asleep.

750
01:12:02,670 --> 01:12:03,840
You looked so scared.

751
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:09,860
Here, come here.

752
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:12,420
Oh, dear God.

753
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:15,540
Shh.

754
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:17,340
Shh.

755
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:21,680
I'm here. It's okay.

756
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:29,620
You're okay.

757
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:30,980
Shh.

758
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:37,901
I was sleeping in their bed

759
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:39,470
the night they went out.

760
01:12:41,150 --> 01:12:42,231
I was meant to go with them

761
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:46,700
to Christmas
drinks at the Walsh's

762
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:49,860
around midnight.

763
01:12:52,475 --> 01:12:53,880
Two police came to the door,

764
01:12:54,020 --> 01:12:55,020
a man and a woman.

765
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:01,320
He had really beautiful,

766
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:02,280
kind eyes

767
01:13:02,430 --> 01:13:04,880
and this thick, dark stubble.

768
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:07,031
It looked like it had been drawn on.

769
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:12,730
The car skidded on black ice.

770
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:16,161
Both of them had been drinking.

771
01:13:18,990 --> 01:13:21,110
Dad was killed right
away, but they took Mum to

772
01:13:22,570 --> 01:13:23,570
St Mary's in Croydon

773
01:13:23,710 --> 01:13:24,911
and she died a few days later.

774
01:13:25,830 --> 01:13:26,830
Did you get to see her?

775
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:30,610
What do you mean?

776
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:31,700
Did you say goodbye?

777
01:13:31,770 --> 01:13:32,770
Mm-hmm, yeah.

778
01:13:33,190 --> 01:13:34,190
No.

779
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:37,150
My granny told it would be too scarring.

780
01:13:39,315 --> 01:13:40,630
Mum went through the windscreen

781
01:13:41,455 --> 01:13:42,170
and she lost an eye,

782
01:13:42,310 --> 01:13:44,830
so she was pretty fucked up.

783
01:13:45,010 --> 01:13:46,010
Jesus.

784
01:13:46,350 --> 01:13:47,350
Yeah.

785
01:13:51,130 --> 01:13:52,251
I went looking for that eye.

786
01:13:55,510 --> 01:13:56,510
I don't know why.

787
01:13:57,460 --> 01:13:58,941
I didn't want anyone else to find it.

788
01:13:59,890 --> 01:14:01,871
I thought it would be
on the side of the road.

789
01:14:04,990 --> 01:14:05,990
She's staring up at me.

790
01:14:06,190 --> 01:14:07,190
Hi.

791
01:14:11,375 --> 01:14:15,190
I did find a tiny piece of
the windscreen glass then.

792
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:22,060
My head had had blood on it,

793
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:23,581
but maybe that's not true.

794
01:14:27,780 --> 01:14:29,160
The nurse said that Mum woke up

795
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:30,960
just before she died.

796
01:14:34,630 --> 01:14:35,796
It must have been so confusing.

797
01:14:35,820 --> 01:14:36,900
You can hardly see.

798
01:14:38,910 --> 01:14:39,560
Dad wasn't there.

799
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:40,620
I wasn't there.

800
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:44,810
I can't even begin to
imagine how you felt.

801
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:49,310
How lonely you must have been.

802
01:14:50,890 --> 01:14:51,890
Yeah, but I...

803
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:53,880
I'd always felt lonely...

804
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Even before.

805
01:14:57,630 --> 01:14:58,630
This was a new feeling.

806
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:01,550
Like, uh...

807
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:07,570
terror.

808
01:15:07,770 --> 01:15:08,770
Like, uh...

809
01:15:10,230 --> 01:15:11,230
that I'd always...

810
01:15:11,770 --> 01:15:12,770
be alone now.

811
01:15:17,990 --> 01:15:20,060
And then, as I got older,

812
01:15:20,380 --> 01:15:21,380
that feeling just...

813
01:15:23,870 --> 01:15:24,870
solidified.

814
01:15:26,630 --> 01:15:29,510
It just... uh... just did not...

815
01:15:29,910 --> 01:15:30,950
here all the time.

816
01:15:32,855 --> 01:15:36,760
And then losing them, I just got
tangled up with all the other stuff.

817
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:38,710
Like being gay,

818
01:15:38,930 --> 01:15:39,930
and...

819
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:43,440
just feeling like...

820
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:50,001
the future doesn't matter.

821
01:15:55,490 --> 01:15:56,550
Does that make sense? Yeah.

822
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:01,980
Yeah...

823
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:10,780
I know how easy it can be
to stop caring about yourself.

824
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:40,970
Will you come with me?

825
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:45,600
Where to?

826
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:49,070
Just let me show you.

827
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:13,520
Whose house is this?

828
01:17:15,420 --> 01:17:16,420
My parents'.

829
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,040
Yeah?

830
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:19,280
Who lives here now? It's okay.

831
01:17:22,940 --> 01:17:23,940
Don't worry.

832
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:25,480
Hello? Adam.

833
01:17:39,650 --> 01:17:40,650
Hello?

834
01:17:42,150 --> 01:17:43,150
Adam.

835
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:11,240
Who? My parents'.

836
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:14,780
This is our house.

837
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:15,600
This is our kitchen.

838
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:16,340
This is our wallpaper.

839
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:19,180
That's our table, where we had
fish and chips every Friday night,

840
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:21,341
so my mother could
pretend we were still Catholic.

841
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:22,360
Adam, I want to go home.

842
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:23,400
Let me take you home.

843
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:24,380
This is my home.

844
01:18:24,420 --> 01:18:25,140
No, it used to be.

845
01:18:25,141 --> 01:18:25,340
Mom!

846
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:26,700
Adam! Dad! Adam, listen.

847
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:28,680
Let me take you home.

848
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:28,820
Look! You go home.

849
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:29,900
You go home.

850
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:31,100
I'm not going.

851
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:32,200
I'm not going.

852
01:18:49,710 --> 01:18:50,710
Can you see them? Let me in.

853
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:02,590
Please.

854
01:19:03,430 --> 01:19:04,430
Please.

855
01:19:05,770 --> 01:19:06,770
Please let me in.

856
01:19:09,310 --> 01:19:10,310
Please let me in.

857
01:19:26,410 --> 01:19:27,410
Why didn't you let us in?

858
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:32,420
Where is he?

859
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:33,480
Is he here? Is her here?

860
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:35,080
No.

861
01:19:37,170 --> 01:19:38,170
We did see him though.

862
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:42,880
I wanted you to meet him.

863
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:46,740
I know, but I don't
think this works like that.

864
01:19:47,470 --> 01:19:49,071
You look like a handsome fellow, though.

865
01:19:51,410 --> 01:19:53,700
Is he your special friend?

866
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:58,360
Do you mean my boyfriend?

867
01:19:58,500 --> 01:19:59,140
Is he my boyfriend?

868
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:00,400
If you could say it.

869
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:01,720
Okay.

870
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:03,440
Well, is he your boyfriend?

871
01:20:05,380 --> 01:20:06,380
Um...

872
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:09,190
I don't know.

873
01:20:12,690 --> 01:20:13,530
Are you in love with him?

874
01:20:13,650 --> 01:20:14,650
No.

875
01:20:18,620 --> 01:20:19,620
Why is that so
strange? I don't know.

876
01:20:23,010 --> 01:20:26,330
I've never been
in love before, so...

877
01:20:27,850 --> 01:20:28,850
Not really.

878
01:20:29,530 --> 01:20:30,530
So this...

879
01:20:32,550 --> 01:20:34,230
I don't know if this is it.

880
01:20:36,030 --> 01:20:37,030
Sweetheart.

881
01:20:38,620 --> 01:20:42,470
Well, he certainly seems to
care about you a whole heap.

882
01:20:43,990 --> 01:20:45,890
In my not-so-humble opinion.

883
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:51,360
You think he'd like
you? I don't know.

884
01:21:20,130 --> 01:21:21,130
So...

885
01:21:21,450 --> 01:21:22,390
I think we need to... No.

886
01:21:22,790 --> 01:21:23,790
Don't say it.

887
01:21:24,870 --> 01:21:25,610
Please don't say it.

888
01:21:25,611 --> 01:21:27,270
We have to. We have to.

889
01:21:28,890 --> 01:21:29,890
Um...

890
01:21:31,070 --> 01:21:32,070
Me and your mum...

891
01:21:33,525 --> 01:21:35,766
We think that it's best you
don't come visit us anymore.

892
01:21:40,265 --> 01:21:41,496
I'm just gonna keep coming and coming.

893
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:42,520
I know you are.

894
01:21:44,030 --> 01:21:45,671
And we can see what this is doing to you.

895
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:48,316
It's not doing anything to me.

896
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:49,340
Yes, it is.

897
01:21:50,750 --> 01:21:51,750
I won't let you move on.

898
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:54,201
Okay, well, I'll come less.

899
01:21:54,990 --> 01:21:56,180
I'll come once a year.

900
01:21:56,900 --> 01:21:57,900
I'll come at Christmas.

901
01:21:58,040 --> 01:21:59,040
Come on, lad.

902
01:21:59,890 --> 01:22:01,796
You have to have known that
this wasn't gonna last forever.

903
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:03,640
I'm not asking for it to last forever.

904
01:22:04,090 --> 01:22:05,090
I'm just...

905
01:22:06,495 --> 01:22:07,576
It hasn't been long enough.

906
01:22:09,810 --> 01:22:11,251
It hasn't been close to long enough.

907
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:18,361
I know, but it never could
be, could it? Hey, listen.

908
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:33,040
Hey, listen.

909
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:35,360
I've got an idea.

910
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,000
How's about...

911
01:22:40,230 --> 01:22:43,760
How's about we got your favourite
place in the whole bloody world?

912
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:45,080
Oh.

913
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:47,800
I'm sure it's still open.

914
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:51,121
An express thing to Disneyland.

915
01:22:51,260 --> 01:22:52,300
It's fucking cheaper, too.

916
01:23:14,690 --> 01:23:15,070
?

917
01:23:15,071 --> 01:23:16,071
?

918
01:23:17,650 --> 01:23:18,290
?

919
01:23:18,291 --> 01:23:19,291
?

920
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:29,380
?

921
01:23:29,381 --> 01:23:31,460
?

922
01:23:31,461 --> 01:23:33,780
?

923
01:23:33,781 --> 01:23:36,740
?

924
01:23:36,741 --> 01:23:38,880
?

925
01:23:38,881 --> 01:23:39,881
?

926
01:23:56,825 --> 01:23:58,780
?

927
01:23:58,781 --> 01:23:59,940
?

928
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:01,580
Oh, Jesus, I told you not to ask.

929
01:24:01,581 --> 01:24:02,880
You want to know.

930
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:05,121
But what if it was slow
and horribly painful?

931
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:05,740
What difference does it make?

932
01:24:05,820 --> 01:24:06,500
It's a big difference.

933
01:24:06,660 --> 01:24:07,660
It was quick.

934
01:24:09,020 --> 01:24:09,540
Was it? Yeah.

935
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:10,760
You.

936
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:13,100
For both of us? Mm-hmm.

937
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:15,120
Uh-huh.

938
01:24:15,980 --> 01:24:17,300
No, you don't seem sure.

939
01:24:17,380 --> 01:24:18,380
Don't be fibbing now.

940
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:19,500
It was quick.

941
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:20,700
It was really quick.

942
01:24:24,140 --> 01:24:25,140
Oh, OK.

943
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:26,540
Yeah, yeah.

944
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:28,381
Yeah, well, that's a
relief, isn't it? Sort.

945
01:24:28,460 --> 01:24:29,460
?

946
01:24:30,580 --> 01:24:32,101
It's been playing on my mind, that is.

947
01:24:37,930 --> 01:24:39,771
What do you think we
should say to each other?

948
01:24:43,490 --> 01:24:45,131
I'm not sure I have much wisdom to share.

949
01:24:46,590 --> 01:24:47,290
I don't know.

950
01:24:47,310 --> 01:24:50,410
Maybe Adam, being older,
should be sharing some with us.

951
01:24:54,970 --> 01:24:56,251
Maybe we shouldn't say anything.

952
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:58,160
Maybe.

953
01:25:01,340 --> 01:25:04,261
Although I will say that getting to
know you has made us very proud, son.

954
01:25:07,810 --> 01:25:09,570
I haven't done anything to be proud of.

955
01:25:10,030 --> 01:25:10,830
I've just muddled through.

956
01:25:10,990 --> 01:25:12,070
No, but you got through it.

957
01:25:13,070 --> 01:25:14,106
Some tough times, I'm sure.

958
01:25:14,130 --> 01:25:15,170
And you're still here.

959
01:25:15,770 --> 01:25:16,770
Mm-hmm.

960
01:25:18,050 --> 01:25:19,050
It's what we're proud of.

961
01:25:35,050 --> 01:25:36,050
Dad.

962
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:42,100
Stay.

963
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:43,480
Stay.

964
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:44,520
Stay a bit longer.

965
01:25:44,740 --> 01:25:45,740
I don't think so.

966
01:25:46,790 --> 01:25:47,790
I love you, darling.

967
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:49,200
I love you, too.

968
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:52,040
You do?

969
01:25:56,390 --> 01:25:57,490
Sometimes I wasn't so sure.

970
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:02,530
Whatever problems we had, I'm
glad we got to be together at the end.

971
01:26:15,990 --> 01:26:17,820
I know I was never good at saying it.

972
01:26:18,970 --> 01:26:20,331
I just couldn't get the words out.

973
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:25,161
But I do love you very much.

974
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:31,080
Somehow, even more, now that I know you.

975
01:26:42,210 --> 01:26:43,611
It's important that you believe me.

976
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:45,900
I do.

977
01:26:48,130 --> 01:26:49,320
I know I love you very much.

978
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:52,080
Dad?

979
01:26:56,140 --> 01:26:57,300
Dad, did you hear that?

980
01:26:58,410 --> 01:27:00,440
Adam, are you there?

981
01:27:01,495 --> 01:27:02,980
I can't see you. Why can't
I see you? I'm here, Mom.

982
01:27:04,940 --> 01:27:05,940
?

983
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Oh, there you are.

984
01:27:12,425 --> 01:27:13,425
I can feel you.

985
01:27:16,010 --> 01:27:17,170
Your skin's lovely and warm.

986
01:27:19,030 --> 01:27:20,030
Now, you listen.

987
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:25,070
You promised me that you're
going to try with this Harry boy.

988
01:27:26,890 --> 01:27:27,890
Yeah.

989
01:27:28,110 --> 01:27:29,170
I'd have liked him.

990
01:27:29,190 --> 01:27:30,190
I know it.

991
01:27:31,230 --> 01:27:33,191
He might need a bit of
taking care of, might you?

992
01:27:35,290 --> 01:27:36,630
He's got such a sad face.

993
01:27:40,730 --> 01:27:41,730
Do you hear me? Yeah, yeah.

994
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:44,470
I hear you.

995
01:27:47,470 --> 01:27:48,470
That's good.

996
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:53,090
I hope you make each other a bit happier.

997
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:09,220
Such a kind and gentle boy.

998
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:11,480
Enjoy.

999
01:28:42,730 --> 01:28:43,730
Thank you.

1000
01:31:40,180 --> 01:31:41,180
Harry?

1001
01:33:40,430 --> 01:33:41,591
What are you doing down here?

1002
01:33:50,060 --> 01:33:51,600
I came to find you.

1003
01:33:55,890 --> 01:33:56,890
Why are you here?

1004
01:34:02,510 --> 01:34:04,600
I said goodbye to them,
so I came to see you.

1005
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:22,100
It's okay.

1006
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:23,560
It's not okay, though, is it?

1007
01:34:34,230 --> 01:34:35,660
I was so scared that night.

1008
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:37,241
I just needed to not be alone.

1009
01:34:57,970 --> 01:34:58,970
I'm sorry.

1010
01:35:02,010 --> 01:35:03,010
I was too scared.

1011
01:35:28,370 --> 01:35:29,370
I'm in there, aren't I?

1012
01:35:34,070 --> 01:35:35,010
Let's just go upstairs.

1013
01:35:35,030 --> 01:35:36,050
No, no, no, no, no.

1014
01:35:36,090 --> 01:35:36,590
I just... No, no,
no, no, no, no.

1015
01:35:36,591 --> 01:35:37,911
I just need you to tell me, okay?

1016
01:35:40,740 --> 01:35:42,010
Because I can smell it.

1017
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:45,190
I can taste it in my throat.

1018
01:35:57,020 --> 01:35:58,150
How come no one found me?

1019
01:36:04,790 --> 01:36:06,540
Well, it was my mum and my dad.

1020
01:36:07,550 --> 01:36:10,100
I found you.

1021
01:36:10,290 --> 01:36:11,290
No, but I...

1022
01:36:11,420 --> 01:36:13,740
Adam, I don't want you
to see me like that in there.

1023
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:15,540
You're not in there. You're not in there.

1024
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:16,560
You're not in there.

1025
01:36:19,180 --> 01:36:20,180
You're here.

1026
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:23,080
You're here.

1027
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:27,300
You're here.

1028
01:36:27,620 --> 01:36:28,620
You're here.

1029
01:36:30,060 --> 01:36:31,060
With me.

1030
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:32,320
With me.

1031
01:36:38,050 --> 01:36:39,170
Let's just go upstairs.

1032
01:36:39,730 --> 01:36:40,730
Let's just go upstairs.

1033
01:36:59,300 --> 01:37:00,820
I saw you, you know.

1034
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:02,760
Your mum.

1035
01:37:04,485 --> 01:37:05,160
Your dad, too.

1036
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:06,240
The house.

1037
01:37:10,215 --> 01:37:11,215
They saw you, too.

1038
01:37:11,940 --> 01:37:12,940
They did.

1039
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,400
My dad said you were a handsome fellow.

1040
01:37:25,005 --> 01:37:26,005
They loved you.

1041
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:28,540
They both would.

1042
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:30,400
Oh, Scott.

1043
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:34,641
Did you get to say what you
wanted to say? I don't know.

1044
01:37:38,410 --> 01:37:39,811
I got to be with her.

1045
01:37:42,180 --> 01:37:43,581
It's good that you're all together.

1046
01:37:45,820 --> 01:37:46,820
Yeah.

1047
01:37:56,030 --> 01:37:57,030
I'm scared.

1048
01:38:00,030 --> 01:38:01,030
I know.

1049
01:38:06,620 --> 01:38:07,620
But I'm here with you.

1050
01:38:16,995 --> 01:38:18,540
Don't let this get tangled up again.

1051
01:38:40,170 --> 01:38:41,170
Okay, come on.

1052
01:38:41,290 --> 01:38:42,290
Okay.

1053
01:39:09,900 --> 01:39:10,900
It's so quiet.

1054
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:18,390
I never could stand
how quiet this place was.

1055
01:39:22,950 --> 01:39:23,991
Well, you put a record on.

1056
01:39:26,240 --> 01:39:27,260
What would you like? You choose.

1057
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:28,320
?

1058
01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:46,500
I'll protect you from the Hooded Claw.

1059
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:50,900
Keep the vampires from your door.

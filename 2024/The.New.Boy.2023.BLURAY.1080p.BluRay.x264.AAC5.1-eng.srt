3
00:03:53,037 --> 00:03:54,405
Police!

4
00:03:54,405 --> 00:03:56,474
Police coming through.

5
00:03:56,474 --> 00:03:57,876
Make way.

6
00:03:57,876 --> 00:04:00,711
Police! Coming through.

7
00:04:00,711 --> 00:04:03,815
Make way. Make way.

8
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:10,654
Come on, make way.
Police business.

9
00:04:54,532 --> 00:04:57,068
Bugger!

10
00:05:41,245 --> 00:05:43,547
Is Dom Peter here?

11
00:05:44,548 --> 00:05:46,617
No, he's asleep.

12
00:05:47,952 --> 00:05:50,789
But he asked me to wait.

13
00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:53,491
I got a special
delivery for him.

14
00:05:53,491 --> 00:05:55,526
It's a little darkie.

15
00:06:00,965 --> 00:06:04,168
No, don't do that,
don't do that. He's a bolter!

16
00:06:06,805 --> 00:06:08,973
Hey! Get out of there.

17
00:06:08,973 --> 00:06:11,209
Little bugger,
come out of there.

18
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:14,212
- Come out of there.
- Is that what we're doing?

19
00:06:14,212 --> 00:06:15,780
- Hey?!
- What are you doing, Sister?

20
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,782
Is it? Come on!

21
00:06:17,782 --> 00:06:19,417
- What are you doing?
- Come on, I dare ya!

22
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:21,452
Take the paperwork, will ya?

23
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:24,222
Jesus!

24
00:06:24,222 --> 00:06:26,557
- What's his name?
- He hasn't got one.

25
00:07:44,035 --> 00:07:46,370
I'm Sister Eileen.

26
00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:27,691
Hey!

27
00:11:32,296 --> 00:11:34,265
-  What?
- You scared him.

28
00:11:34,265 --> 00:11:35,399
Oh.

29
00:11:37,301 --> 00:11:39,003
Here.

30
00:11:39,003 --> 00:11:40,839
What's your name?

31
00:11:44,776 --> 00:11:46,911
Hey.

32
00:11:46,911 --> 00:11:48,947
Look here, new kid.

33
00:11:57,588 --> 00:12:00,091
Ahh. Mm-mm.

34
00:12:01,325 --> 00:12:02,861
You want some?

35
00:12:21,045 --> 00:12:22,947
Come on.

36
00:12:22,947 --> 00:12:26,117
- He's not a joey.
- Hmm.

37
00:12:29,687 --> 00:12:31,489
Come here. Come on.

38
00:12:31,489 --> 00:12:33,657
Come on over.

39
00:12:45,069 --> 00:12:48,472
You like that?

40
00:12:48,472 --> 00:12:51,009
That's my marmalade.
Here, come here.

41
00:12:58,049 --> 00:13:00,351
Do...

42
00:13:00,351 --> 00:13:02,186
-  Want this, yeah?
-  Hey!

43
00:13:02,186 --> 00:13:04,188
He's from the desert, that kid.

44
00:13:08,492 --> 00:13:10,494
Go back to sleep.

45
00:14:17,528 --> 00:14:19,730
Hello. What's your name?

46
00:14:21,365 --> 00:14:23,201
Come on, out you come.

47
00:14:23,201 --> 00:14:24,535
You wanna meet everyone?

48
00:14:27,671 --> 00:14:29,073
Come on, come out.

49
00:14:42,286 --> 00:14:43,822
He's wearing a dress!

50
00:16:57,255 --> 00:16:59,357
Good morning, my son.

51
00:17:01,993 --> 00:17:06,064
Alright. Go on.
Go and join your brothers.

52
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,576
Glory be to the Father,
and to the Son,

53
00:17:18,576 --> 00:17:21,946
and to the Holy Ghost,
as it was in the beginning,

54
00:17:21,946 --> 00:17:26,117
is now and ever shall be,
world without end.

55
00:17:26,117 --> 00:17:28,586
-  Amen.
-  Amen.

56
00:17:28,586 --> 00:17:30,088
Now, ah...

57
00:17:32,323 --> 00:17:37,128
...there's a new boy
who joined us last night.

58
00:17:37,128 --> 00:17:41,099
I'm sure you've all met him,
but I hope that you will

59
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:45,203
show him the ways of our
little family and welcome him

60
00:17:45,203 --> 00:17:47,972
into, into the fold.

61
00:17:47,972 --> 00:17:50,174
Thank you, Sister.

62
00:17:57,782 --> 00:17:59,183
So,

63
00:17:59,183 --> 00:18:02,686
as one lamb arrives,

64
00:18:02,686 --> 00:18:04,288
another departs.

65
00:18:04,288 --> 00:18:07,458
And we are sad, today,
that our Johnny

66
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:10,962
is leaving us
to begin a new journey.

67
00:18:10,962 --> 00:18:12,797
Come forward.

68
00:18:14,866 --> 00:18:17,501
That's right.

69
00:18:17,501 --> 00:18:19,904
Yep, you've got to bend over it.
That's right.

70
00:18:19,904 --> 00:18:21,339
Good boy.

71
00:18:23,241 --> 00:18:25,376
Dear Lord,

72
00:18:25,376 --> 00:18:28,346
I present this lost boy to you

73
00:18:28,346 --> 00:18:31,382
so that he may be baptised
and join your flock.

74
00:18:33,952 --> 00:18:35,419
May the water

75
00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:37,288
from your heart

76
00:18:37,288 --> 00:18:40,091
wash away all his sins.

77
00:18:43,494 --> 00:18:48,266
In the name of our Lord,
I baptise you... John.

78
00:18:58,576 --> 00:19:01,545
- Thank you, Sister.
- Okay.

79
00:19:03,214 --> 00:19:05,449
Now, will you all turn to

80
00:19:05,449 --> 00:19:08,486
your hymn books, page 62.

81
00:19:09,453 --> 00:19:11,089
"The Lord is my Shepherd."

82
00:19:19,864 --> 00:19:24,668
♪ The Lord's my Shepherd ♪

83
00:19:24,668 --> 00:19:27,738
♪ I'll not want ♪

84
00:19:27,738 --> 00:19:33,644
♪ He makes me down to lie ♪

85
00:19:33,644 --> 00:19:37,181
♪ In pastures green ♪

86
00:19:37,181 --> 00:19:41,452
♪ He leadeth me ♪

87
00:19:41,452 --> 00:19:47,425
♪ The quiet waters by ♪

88
00:20:30,701 --> 00:20:33,104
Come on, boys.

89
00:20:36,374 --> 00:20:38,242
Come on. Hep, hep.

90
00:21:24,823 --> 00:21:26,357
Come and get it, boys.

91
00:21:45,343 --> 00:21:48,046
I'm sad to see you leave, Johnny.

92
00:21:48,046 --> 00:21:50,281
You're a good boy.
You look after yourself.

93
00:21:50,281 --> 00:21:52,283
Thank you, Sister Mum.

94
00:21:52,283 --> 00:21:54,318
Know when to bite your tongue.

95
00:21:56,921 --> 00:21:58,489
Michael.

96
00:21:58,489 --> 00:22:00,624
Thank you, Sister Mum.

97
00:22:00,624 --> 00:22:01,826
Matthew.

98
00:22:03,027 --> 00:22:05,363
Thank you, Sister Mum.

99
00:22:06,297 --> 00:22:07,698
Steven.

100
00:22:07,698 --> 00:22:10,034
Thank you, Sister Mum.

101
00:22:10,034 --> 00:22:11,669
James.

102
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:13,304
Thank you, Sister Mum.

103
00:22:13,304 --> 00:22:15,573
Henry.

104
00:22:15,573 --> 00:22:18,209
Thank you, Sister Mum.

105
00:22:18,209 --> 00:22:21,512
Ah, the little new one.

106
00:22:21,512 --> 00:22:23,747
Every kid here
calls me Sister Mum,

107
00:22:23,747 --> 00:22:25,416
'cause they don't have a mum.

108
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:27,018
And if you ain't got one,

109
00:22:27,018 --> 00:22:29,487
you can call me
Sister Mum too, okay?

110
00:22:37,829 --> 00:22:39,864
Hmm.

111
00:22:47,338 --> 00:22:49,140
Alright, now George is here.

112
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,375
John?

113
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:54,078
Would you please
bless our meal one last time?

114
00:22:56,314 --> 00:22:57,782
Yes, Sister.

115
00:23:04,488 --> 00:23:06,157
Dear Lord,

116
00:23:07,158 --> 00:23:08,893
We ask you to bless this meal

117
00:23:08,893 --> 00:23:11,429
that Sister Mum
has prepared for us.

118
00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:14,198
For this food,
we give you thanks.

119
00:23:14,198 --> 00:23:18,436
-  Amen.
-  Amen.

120
00:23:30,648 --> 00:23:32,083
Grant us, O Lord,

121
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:33,785
we beseech thee
a safe journey,

122
00:23:33,785 --> 00:23:36,620
so that under thy guidance and
the guidance of the holy angels,

123
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,290
we may safely reach
our destination.

124
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:41,826
St. Christopher, the
patron saint of travellers,

125
00:23:41,826 --> 00:23:44,295
pray for us,
and protect us from evil.

126
00:23:44,295 --> 00:23:47,665
In the name of the
Father and the Son...

127
00:23:47,665 --> 00:23:51,702
In the name of the Father,
of the Son and the Holy Spirit.

128
00:23:51,702 --> 00:23:54,505
- Amen.
- Amen.

129
00:24:02,446 --> 00:24:04,282
Will you write to us, John?

130
00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:08,119
Look forward to hearing
of your progress.

131
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:10,721
And these,
these are your papers.

132
00:24:10,721 --> 00:24:13,424
- Keep them safe, you hear?
- Yes, Sister.

133
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,960
Ohh!

134
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,096
Look, it's a miracle.

135
00:24:18,096 --> 00:24:19,597
It's a shilling.

136
00:24:19,597 --> 00:24:22,033
Just in case.

137
00:24:22,033 --> 00:24:23,868
Thank you, Sister.

138
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,505
Be a good boy.

139
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,494
Ah...

140
00:24:59,203 --> 00:25:02,440
Don't get too excited.
There's no knife in it.

141
00:25:17,255 --> 00:25:19,924
Bye, Johnny.

142
00:25:48,787 --> 00:25:51,055
Just don't worry, children.

143
00:25:51,055 --> 00:25:53,557
With Michael here,

144
00:25:53,557 --> 00:25:55,659
as our new head boy,

145
00:25:55,659 --> 00:25:59,197
you know we're going
to be in safe hands.

146
00:25:59,197 --> 00:26:03,101
Hey, Sister Mum,
might we have a cake tonight?

147
00:26:03,101 --> 00:26:06,971
In honour of Michael's big day.
What do you reckon, boys?

148
00:26:06,971 --> 00:26:10,942
- Rum and raisin? Eh?
-  Yes, please, Sister.

149
00:26:39,237 --> 00:26:41,005
Hurry up.

150
00:26:41,672 --> 00:26:43,541
Do your bed.

151
00:26:43,541 --> 00:26:46,377
And make sure you
do my bed as well.

152
00:26:46,377 --> 00:26:48,712
Okay.

153
00:27:07,465 --> 00:27:10,869
Ahh.
Morning, Dom Peter.

154
00:27:10,869 --> 00:27:13,471
It's a lovely day.

155
00:27:14,873 --> 00:27:18,777
Anyway, I told a lie
to a policeman.

156
00:27:19,577 --> 00:27:21,612
Well...

157
00:27:21,612 --> 00:27:24,215
...picked a fight, actually.

158
00:27:24,949 --> 00:27:26,384
And, um...

159
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:34,158
Well, all the children are well.

160
00:27:34,158 --> 00:27:36,294
And as you can see,

161
00:27:36,294 --> 00:27:39,530
we got a new one
last night, so...

162
00:27:40,698 --> 00:27:42,000
Ahh...

163
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,501
Yeah...

164
00:27:43,501 --> 00:27:45,837
Wow!

165
00:27:45,837 --> 00:27:50,274
What a difference
a year makes, hey?

166
00:27:51,242 --> 00:27:52,710
Anyway, um...

167
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:55,079
Yeah, come on, son.
There's nothing to see here.

168
00:27:59,217 --> 00:28:02,286
Yeah,
and I baptised Johnny.

169
00:28:04,022 --> 00:28:07,058
I'm not sure if it worked,
I know it's a priest thing,

170
00:28:07,058 --> 00:28:09,360
not a nun thing.

171
00:28:13,297 --> 00:28:16,067
Oi! Careful!

172
00:28:20,671 --> 00:28:23,474
It's a year to the day,
you know?

173
00:28:23,474 --> 00:28:25,877
Since he died.

174
00:28:25,877 --> 00:28:29,280
Swearing at us
while we wiped his bum.

175
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,917
Yeah. Well, we haven't been
struck down by lightning, yet.

176
00:28:32,917 --> 00:28:34,585
I think the Lord might be

177
00:28:34,585 --> 00:28:36,154
alright with our
little arrangement.

178
00:28:37,588 --> 00:28:40,224
- Hmm?
- They'll find out.

179
00:28:40,224 --> 00:28:42,626
We will be punished.

180
00:28:42,626 --> 00:28:44,863
- And they'll send another one.
- It doesn't matter to them.

181
00:28:44,863 --> 00:28:47,698
As long as we send
the profit from the harvest.

182
00:28:47,698 --> 00:28:51,102
The Lord will protect us, Sister.

183
00:28:51,102 --> 00:28:53,437
Where's that new boy gone?

184
00:28:54,505 --> 00:28:57,541
There he is.
Hugging a tree.

185
00:28:57,541 --> 00:29:00,578
Oi! Hey, cut it out.

186
00:29:01,712 --> 00:29:04,783
Come on. Come on.

187
00:29:04,783 --> 00:29:07,618
Now, you'll break your arm, eh?

188
00:30:16,754 --> 00:30:18,957
Go on.

189
00:30:18,957 --> 00:30:21,325
Go play with the other boys.

190
00:30:32,636 --> 00:30:34,372
"To the Chief Protector

191
00:30:34,372 --> 00:30:36,174
"of Aborigines, Mr Krank.

192
00:30:38,242 --> 00:30:42,280
"The boy John has been sent to
work on Dermott Downs Station.

193
00:30:43,882 --> 00:30:45,784
"While I appreciate that the war

194
00:30:45,784 --> 00:30:48,920
"has left many farms
light-handed,

195
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,889
"the boy's education will suffer

196
00:30:50,889 --> 00:30:54,959
"as a result of this premature
induction into the workforce.

197
00:30:54,959 --> 00:30:59,630
"After all, John is
only a boy of 13.

198
00:31:04,068 --> 00:31:06,504
"I trust you will see
God's wisdom in this.

199
00:31:07,505 --> 00:31:10,041
"Yours sincerely,

200
00:31:10,041 --> 00:31:12,510
"Dom Peter."

201
00:32:20,411 --> 00:32:21,813
Sit back down.

202
00:32:59,884 --> 00:33:01,185
Uh-oh!

203
00:33:01,185 --> 00:33:03,421
George will have
something to say about that.

204
00:33:21,973 --> 00:33:23,407
Oi, darkie!

205
00:33:24,776 --> 00:33:27,578
Matthew says
he wants to fight you.

206
00:33:28,546 --> 00:33:30,248
Yeah, I'm going to
give it to you.

207
00:33:30,248 --> 00:33:32,851
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!

208
00:33:32,851 --> 00:33:36,287
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

209
00:33:36,287 --> 00:33:39,057
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!

210
00:33:40,391 --> 00:33:42,126
- You got him, Matty.

211
00:34:35,847 --> 00:34:37,882
Good morning, my sons!

212
00:34:38,883 --> 00:34:41,419
Ohhh. It's hot in here.

213
00:34:41,419 --> 00:34:43,154
Michael?

214
00:34:52,696 --> 00:34:54,899
What's going on here?

215
00:34:56,234 --> 00:34:57,368
Michael?

216
00:35:01,906 --> 00:35:04,208
Oh, come on.
He's so small, and he's not.

217
00:35:04,208 --> 00:35:05,643
Sister, last night,

218
00:35:05,643 --> 00:35:07,378
I caught Matthew here
stealing food.

219
00:35:07,378 --> 00:35:10,514
- And this was his punishment?
- No.

220
00:35:10,514 --> 00:35:12,050
No?

221
00:35:13,117 --> 00:35:14,585
Well...

222
00:35:14,585 --> 00:35:16,120
You're head boy, now.

223
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,189
So what should
his punishment be?

224
00:35:19,924 --> 00:35:22,693
-  Caning.
-  Caning?

225
00:35:26,564 --> 00:35:29,700
We haven't caned a boy
in over a year.

226
00:35:34,072 --> 00:35:36,007
Is that what you really want?

227
00:35:37,741 --> 00:35:39,710
Michael, being head boy

228
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:43,014
brings with it a
certain amount of power.

229
00:35:43,014 --> 00:35:45,583
But it will also
bring you challenges.

230
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:48,619
It is times like this that the
Devil will test you, Michael.

231
00:35:48,619 --> 00:35:51,222
- You understand?
- Yes, Sister.

232
00:35:51,222 --> 00:35:52,556
Alright.

233
00:35:52,556 --> 00:35:55,827
I'll leave the decision
between you and God.

234
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:14,145
-  Ow!

235
00:36:18,516 --> 00:36:20,118
Cut it out!

236
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,056
Come on, that's enough.

237
00:36:25,056 --> 00:36:27,491
Now get ready for church.

238
00:36:27,491 --> 00:36:29,627
Go on, go wash up.

239
00:36:29,627 --> 00:36:31,429
Come on, go wash up.

240
00:36:33,764 --> 00:36:35,834
Matthew, come on.

241
00:36:35,834 --> 00:36:37,969
Matthew!

242
00:38:08,492 --> 00:38:11,529
Give us this day
our daily bread.

243
00:38:11,529 --> 00:38:13,031
And forgive us our trespasses,

244
00:38:13,031 --> 00:38:16,334
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

245
00:38:16,334 --> 00:38:20,471
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

246
00:38:20,471 --> 00:38:21,806
Again.

247
00:38:21,806 --> 00:38:24,408
Our Father
who art in heaven,

248
00:38:24,408 --> 00:38:26,811
hallowed be thy name.

249
00:38:26,811 --> 00:38:28,179
Thy Kingdom come,

250
00:38:28,179 --> 00:38:32,016
thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

251
00:38:32,016 --> 00:38:35,086
Give us this day
our daily bread.

252
00:38:35,086 --> 00:38:37,388
And forgive us our trespasses,

253
00:38:37,388 --> 00:38:40,892
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

254
00:38:40,892 --> 00:38:43,127
And lead us not into temptation,

255
00:38:43,127 --> 00:38:44,662
but deliver us from evil.

256
00:38:44,662 --> 00:38:46,164
...deliver us from evil.

257
00:38:46,164 --> 00:38:48,199
-  Amen.
-  Amen.

258
00:38:52,904 --> 00:38:54,605
Hey.

259
00:39:00,278 --> 00:39:02,613
Steven, he gets two scoops.

260
00:39:04,315 --> 00:39:07,151
- Oh! He gets two scoops.
- I know.

261
00:39:43,321 --> 00:39:45,289
So what happened this morning?

262
00:39:45,289 --> 00:39:48,126
Hmm? Oh.

263
00:39:48,126 --> 00:39:50,829
I think it's called
'the pecking order'.

264
00:39:57,568 --> 00:40:00,304
Ah, they'll sort it out.

265
00:40:00,304 --> 00:40:02,306
Now,

266
00:40:02,306 --> 00:40:04,408
as you know...

267
00:40:05,509 --> 00:40:10,581
...today is the first day
of the olive harvest.

268
00:40:10,581 --> 00:40:14,252
And George
will be here to help.

269
00:40:14,252 --> 00:40:16,020
Now,

270
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,222
many of you were
here last year,

271
00:40:18,222 --> 00:40:22,326
so you're expected to teach
those children who weren't,

272
00:40:22,326 --> 00:40:24,762
how the harvest works.

273
00:40:27,065 --> 00:40:31,002
Now, in our little family,

274
00:40:31,002 --> 00:40:32,971
everyone contributes.

275
00:40:37,942 --> 00:40:40,378
When we take pride
in our work,

276
00:40:40,378 --> 00:40:43,347
we take pride in ourselves.

277
00:40:43,347 --> 00:40:45,616
- Good Lord.

278
00:40:47,085 --> 00:40:48,619
Mum!

279
00:40:49,553 --> 00:40:52,256
One, two, three...

280
00:40:58,462 --> 00:41:00,698
Oh, ow!

281
00:41:00,698 --> 00:41:02,901
It shouldn't sting
for too long.

282
00:41:46,244 --> 00:41:50,748
Pssss!

283
00:42:50,408 --> 00:42:52,877
Hey, you like that jam?

284
00:42:52,877 --> 00:42:54,578
That's my jam.

285
00:42:54,578 --> 00:42:55,980
George's jam.

286
00:43:03,587 --> 00:43:05,256
Good boy, Bear.

287
00:43:07,859 --> 00:43:09,593
Good boy, Bear.

288
00:43:10,995 --> 00:43:12,696
Good boy, Bear.

289
00:44:05,483 --> 00:44:07,952
Got a few bags, George?

290
00:44:08,987 --> 00:44:12,056
- Good start?
-  Yeah, good workers.

291
00:44:13,624 --> 00:44:15,393
How's
the new boy doing?

292
00:44:15,393 --> 00:44:17,628
Yeah,
he's doing alright.

293
00:44:17,628 --> 00:44:19,063
Good.

294
00:44:20,031 --> 00:44:21,800
Needs a name, though.

295
00:44:23,467 --> 00:44:25,736
You going to wet his head, too?

296
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:28,639
We'll just call him
New Boy for now.

297
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:30,441
You're the boss.

298
00:44:31,442 --> 00:44:33,878
Alright,
it's lunch, boys.

299
00:44:35,279 --> 00:44:37,048
Alright.

300
00:44:39,784 --> 00:44:41,786
Right, who'd like a sandwich?

301
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,890
Michael, would you
hand out the sandwiches?

302
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:47,225
Alright.

303
00:44:53,965 --> 00:44:55,699
Yes. Come on, Bear.

304
00:44:57,135 --> 00:44:59,003
"To Dom Peter.

305
00:44:59,003 --> 00:45:00,839
That's it.

306
00:45:01,773 --> 00:45:04,075
"He has been sent."

307
00:45:13,384 --> 00:45:15,920
Okay, men,
let's get to that rock wall.

308
00:45:17,121 --> 00:45:18,923
Come this way.
This way here.

309
00:45:28,967 --> 00:45:30,568
Hey.

310
00:45:31,635 --> 00:45:33,972
Go find the boys.

311
00:45:33,972 --> 00:45:35,874
You've got to pull your weight.

312
00:45:49,153 --> 00:45:52,156
"He has been sent.

313
00:45:52,156 --> 00:45:55,393
"We pray that this ghastly war
will soon end,

314
00:45:55,393 --> 00:45:58,930
"but until that day
he must remain in your care.

315
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:02,666
"We trust, Dom Peter,
that you will guard him wisely,

316
00:46:02,666 --> 00:46:06,137
"as you guard the lost souls
under your charge."

317
00:46:30,494 --> 00:46:32,563
That's it.

318
00:46:35,566 --> 00:46:37,668
Come on, keep 'em coming.

319
00:46:37,668 --> 00:46:39,403
Rocks there.

320
00:46:45,409 --> 00:46:47,545
George, Michael fainted!

321
00:46:47,545 --> 00:46:49,013
Snake!

322
00:46:49,013 --> 00:46:52,216
- Hey? Where? Move, move!
- There!

323
00:46:55,219 --> 00:46:56,420
Kill it.

324
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:58,256
Go get help. Go, go, go!

325
00:47:10,534 --> 00:47:11,735
Shit!

326
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:21,412
Come on, boy.
Come on, boy. Come on!

327
00:47:21,412 --> 00:47:22,981
Come on, boy.

328
00:48:57,108 --> 00:48:59,377
Before
the snake told Eve

329
00:48:59,377 --> 00:49:00,979
to eat the forbidden fruit,

330
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:03,347
they were oblivious to evil.

331
00:49:03,347 --> 00:49:05,683
They thought not bad thoughts

332
00:49:05,683 --> 00:49:08,086
and did not bad things.

333
00:49:08,086 --> 00:49:11,089
And they were naked
in their innocence.

334
00:49:14,292 --> 00:49:15,593
Whoa.

335
00:49:17,528 --> 00:49:19,030
Come on.

336
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:49,994
Well, quit your gawking.

337
00:49:50,995 --> 00:49:53,431
Sister Eileen will put
the radio on for yas.

338
00:49:53,431 --> 00:49:56,367
Hmm, good idea, Sister.
Come on, boys.

339
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:12,543
That's Mary,
that's me,

340
00:51:12,543 --> 00:51:14,212

Rise and shine, boys!

354
00:53:24,575 --> 00:53:26,911
There's a lot of work
to do today.

355
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:31,682
Now Michael will stay in bed.
Perhaps tomorrow he'll join us.

356
00:53:31,682 --> 00:53:33,684
Come on, wake up!

357
00:53:33,684 --> 00:53:36,654
Much to do. Much to do.

358
00:53:50,068 --> 00:53:53,504
Yeah, hold him up.
Keep him tight. Hold it!

359
00:54:52,931 --> 00:54:55,433
Over here! Over here!
Over here! He's over here!

360
00:54:55,433 --> 00:54:57,435
There's a big...
There's a big one in here!

361
00:54:58,870 --> 00:55:00,805
I've got it! I've got it!

362
00:55:00,805 --> 00:55:02,373
Come here!
You're not even looking!

363
00:55:04,909 --> 00:55:07,645
- Oh, wait, it ran away!
- He's just over there!

364
00:55:07,645 --> 00:55:10,014
He's over there! He's over
there! He's over there!

365
00:55:19,223 --> 00:55:20,591
Hmm.

366
00:56:08,339 --> 00:56:09,740
Look, Sister!

367
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:11,876
George, stop.

368
00:56:11,876 --> 00:56:13,912
- Bear, whoa, Bear.
- Stop, stop!

369
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:56,754
Hello!

370
00:57:03,661 --> 00:57:05,696
Hello!

371
00:57:05,696 --> 00:57:08,867
- Hello! Ah, my friend!
-  Ah, g'day.

372
00:57:08,867 --> 00:57:13,304
Oh! I see you have
our precious cargo.

373
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:15,306
Yeah, I do, Sister.

374
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:17,075
I just need a Dom Peter

375
00:57:17,075 --> 00:57:18,742
to be able to
sign for it, please.

376
00:57:18,742 --> 00:57:20,979
He's not here, he's...

377
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:22,781
Um...

378
00:57:24,215 --> 00:57:25,516
Yeah, I'll sign.

379
00:57:25,516 --> 00:57:28,586
Ah, I'm afraid
it has to be Dom Peter

380
00:57:28,586 --> 00:57:30,388
that takes delivery
of the goods.

381
00:57:30,388 --> 00:57:33,357
Of course, of course.

382
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:38,262
You know, when I said
Dom Peter wasn't here,

383
00:57:38,262 --> 00:57:40,498
I meant he's not 'all here'.

384
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:42,133
Oh!

385
00:57:43,134 --> 00:57:44,368
Well...

386
00:57:51,409 --> 00:57:53,711
Wait, um...

387
00:57:53,711 --> 00:57:57,148
I'll see if I can...
I'll see if I can rouse him.

388
00:58:12,396 --> 00:58:13,631
Right.

389
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:17,869
Yeah...

390
00:58:22,573 --> 00:58:25,076
Yeah, yeah, he...

391
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:29,013
Is that a '38 or a '39?

392
00:58:29,013 --> 00:58:30,849
-  Mum!
-  Ah, it's a '39, mate.

393
00:58:30,849 --> 00:58:32,917
Sister Mum!

394
00:58:32,917 --> 00:58:34,152
Is it...

395
00:58:45,196 --> 00:58:47,531
Is it the old crank start?

396
00:58:47,531 --> 00:58:49,367
No, electric start.

397
00:58:49,367 --> 00:58:51,769
Tell you, mate,
there won't be any new models,

398
00:58:51,769 --> 00:58:53,404
not until after this war
is done, anyway.

399
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:54,806
Yeah.

400
00:58:54,806 --> 00:58:56,574
- When's that going to be?
-  Who knows?

401
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:58,576
Why did you wake me up?

402
00:58:58,576 --> 00:59:00,211
What do you want, you slut?

403
00:59:00,211 --> 00:59:01,579
Sign, just here!

404
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:03,414
Get out of here,
you dirty slut.

405
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:04,849
Sign!

406
00:59:04,849 --> 00:59:06,584
I'm not signing.
What's that?

407
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:08,286
Ow! Get off me,
I'm not signing that, you slut.

408
00:59:08,286 --> 00:59:09,954
Oh!

409
00:59:09,954 --> 00:59:11,722
Go on, go on,
give me a kiss, you slut.

410
00:59:11,722 --> 00:59:13,391
Forgive me, Father.

411
00:59:13,391 --> 00:59:16,160
Come on, if
you're here, come and give me...

412
00:59:18,062 --> 00:59:21,265
Come here
with your paper, you whore.

413
00:59:21,265 --> 00:59:23,001
Just go and give me a kiss,
you slut.

414
00:59:24,702 --> 00:59:26,537
Hmm.

415
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:31,342
He signed!

416
00:59:33,344 --> 00:59:35,780
-  Crazy, huh?
- He signed.

417
00:59:38,282 --> 00:59:40,118
Ah, okay.

418
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:41,752
Sorry about the language.

419
00:59:41,752 --> 00:59:43,387
Yep, thank you.

420
00:59:43,387 --> 00:59:46,991
- He's not himself.
-  Okay, um...

421
00:59:48,993 --> 00:59:51,395
Do you want to give us
a hand with this, mate?

422
00:59:51,395 --> 00:59:52,530
Yes!

423
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:55,834
Come on, boys.

424
00:59:55,834 --> 00:59:57,101
Come on!

425
00:59:57,101 --> 00:59:59,370
- Wait 'til I see something.
- Come on.

426
00:59:59,370 --> 01:00:01,239
Ow!

427
01:00:05,743 --> 01:00:07,979
Alright, that's it.
Chock him up.

428
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:11,415
Alright, men,
get around to the front.

429
01:00:11,415 --> 01:00:15,119
Sister, you sounded
just like Dom Peter.

430
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:17,555
Oh, children,
you just heard some words

431
01:00:17,555 --> 01:00:19,490
that you haven't heard
for quite some time.

432
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:21,960
And I pray you'll never have
to hear them again.

433
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,895
What is it, Sister?

434
01:00:23,895 --> 01:00:26,230
It's a great
responsibility, Michael.

435
01:00:27,198 --> 01:00:28,666
- Quickly, come on.
-  Alright.

436
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:30,334
Let's get it into the church.

437
01:00:30,334 --> 01:00:31,769
-  Alright, grab a side.
-  Okay.

438
01:00:31,769 --> 01:00:35,406
Right, grab a handle.
One, two, three!

439
01:00:35,406 --> 01:00:37,308
Careful, boys.
Watch your fingers.

440
01:00:37,308 --> 01:00:39,077
Right.

441
01:00:39,077 --> 01:00:41,179
Slide him off.
Put him down there.

442
01:00:42,613 --> 01:00:44,949
Put him up. Good men. Good.

443
01:00:52,156 --> 01:00:53,524
Yeah.

444
01:00:57,461 --> 01:01:01,632
Oh, blessed Father.

445
01:01:06,304 --> 01:01:08,773
He's travelled a long way.

446
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:19,417
He had to be
hidden from some nasty people,

447
01:01:19,417 --> 01:01:21,920
doing some nasty things.

448
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,621
The Nazis?

449
01:01:23,621 --> 01:01:25,656
He's all that's good,

450
01:01:25,656 --> 01:01:27,725
and all that's holy.

451
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:30,461
And all that
they seek to destroy.

452
01:01:30,461 --> 01:01:32,730
Who, the nasties?

453
01:01:33,697 --> 01:01:36,667
Yes, Henry, the nasties.

454
01:01:43,441 --> 01:01:45,576
Now it's said

455
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:47,912
that he can perform miracles.

456
01:01:51,883 --> 01:01:53,885

Will you slaughter a lamb?

476
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,122
We're going to have
a feast tonight.

477
01:03:40,724 --> 01:03:42,861
Come on.

478
01:03:53,905 --> 01:03:56,340
Whoooo-hoooo!

Oh, you're a long way from home,
little lizard eater.

480
01:04:37,715 --> 01:04:40,084
I'm on a good wicket here, boy.

Don't you go stuffing
it up for me.

482
01:04:44,588 --> 01:04:46,424
Go on, get.

01:05:23,027 --> 01:05:26,397

Lord, blessed are you
for giving us this food.

487
01:06:32,096 --> 01:06:34,933
Blessed are you
for giving us our home.

Blessed... blessed is Jesus
who arrived today.

489

Go get it out of here!

512
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:13,411
I said, get it out!

Oh, no, boys, come on.
Go and sit down.

Um...

519
01:18:34,786 --> 01:18:36,220
Thank you.

520
01:18:52,136 --> 01:18:54,405
-  Come on!

521
01:18:54,405 --> 01:18:56,640
And... come on!

522
01:19:01,279 --> 01:19:03,514
Hey, Michael,
go over that way.

523
01:19:03,514 --> 01:19:05,716
Look after those
fires over there.

524
01:21:32,864 --> 01:21:34,032
Argh!

525
01:22:36,027 --> 01:22:37,829
Come on.

526
01:25:14,118 --> 01:25:16,454
Ahh!

527
01:27:01,359 --> 01:27:03,327
I understand.

528
01:27:08,967 --> 01:27:11,202
Tell me what to do.

529
01:27:55,613 --> 01:27:57,381
Oh, shit.

530
01:28:12,630 --> 01:28:14,465
Just cut it out.

531
01:28:29,380 --> 01:28:30,849
Come on.

532
01:28:30,849 --> 01:28:32,583
Careful.

533
01:28:32,583 --> 01:28:34,352
You might break him.

534
01:28:34,352 --> 01:28:36,120
I said cut it out!

535
01:28:38,156 --> 01:28:39,557
He's sacred!

536
01:30:36,007 --> 01:30:38,276
I know what that kid is.

537
01:30:39,778 --> 01:30:41,445
Come on, men.

538
01:31:23,922 --> 01:31:25,323
Go home!

539
01:31:27,325 --> 01:31:29,193
Go on, get.

540
01:31:46,845 --> 01:31:49,680
...you were
raised from the dead.

541
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:53,584
I receive Jesus Christ as my
Lord, sent for all our sins.

542
01:31:53,584 --> 01:31:56,988
Dear God, I confess that I
have sinned and done wrong.

543
01:31:56,988 --> 01:31:59,390
I believe that your son
Jesus Christ

544
01:31:59,390 --> 01:32:00,959
took the punishment
I deserve

545
01:32:00,959 --> 01:32:03,061
and died on the cross
and I thank you.

546
01:32:03,061 --> 01:32:05,429
I also believe that you
raised him from the dead.

547
01:32:05,429 --> 01:32:08,666
And I receive Jesus Christ
as my Lord and saviour.

548
01:32:08,666 --> 01:32:11,102
I believe that your son
Jesus Christ

549
01:32:11,102 --> 01:32:12,837
took the punishment
I deserve

550
01:32:12,837 --> 01:32:14,705
and died on the cross
and I thank you.

551
01:32:14,705 --> 01:32:16,574
You raised him
from the dead.

552
01:32:16,574 --> 01:32:19,310
And I receive Jesus Christ
as my Lord and saviour.

553
01:32:19,310 --> 01:32:22,013
God! Dear God, I accept
I have sinned and done wrong.

554
01:32:22,013 --> 01:32:24,382
And I receive Jesus Christ
as my Lord and saviour.

555
01:32:26,317 --> 01:32:27,786
Dear God...

556
01:37:50,674 --> 01:37:51,910
Oh!

557
01:37:56,214 --> 01:37:57,916
Where is he?

558
01:37:57,916 --> 01:37:59,784
What have you done?

559
01:38:04,355 --> 01:38:06,357
What have you done?

560
01:38:10,995 --> 01:38:12,130
Oh.

561
01:38:17,368 --> 01:38:18,536
Amen.

562
01:38:20,271 --> 01:38:22,140
Why?

563
01:38:22,140 --> 01:38:25,509
Why would you do this to us?

564
01:38:43,594 --> 01:38:45,463
Here he is.

565
01:38:59,243 --> 01:39:01,245
Thank you, Sister Mum.

566
01:39:05,316 --> 01:39:07,618
Thank you, Sister Mum.

567
01:39:08,619 --> 01:39:10,254
Thank you, Sister Mum.

568
01:39:13,091 --> 01:39:15,026
Thank you, Sister Mum.

569
01:39:32,243 --> 01:39:34,012
Amen.

570
01:40:40,945 --> 01:40:42,713
Okay.

571
01:41:11,075 --> 01:41:14,245
Stupid, stupid girl.

572
01:42:40,631 --> 01:42:42,834
He will not abandon you,

573
01:42:42,834 --> 01:42:45,436
for he is your Father.

574
01:42:45,436 --> 01:42:48,739
And as your Father,
he will protect you.

575
01:42:49,908 --> 01:42:52,243
For you are his sons.

576
01:42:53,244 --> 01:42:55,679
- He gave you life.

577
01:42:55,679 --> 01:42:58,416
So that you shall give
your life to him.

578
01:43:22,774 --> 01:43:27,378
May your divine assistance
always be with us.

579
01:43:27,378 --> 01:43:31,182
And may the souls
of the faithfully departed...

580
01:43:31,182 --> 01:43:32,616
Sister!

581
01:43:33,617 --> 01:43:35,887
...with the mercy of God...

582
01:43:38,089 --> 01:43:39,858
...rest in peace.

583
01:43:41,159 --> 01:43:42,693
Amen.

584
01:43:53,671 --> 01:43:55,339
Son?

585
01:44:03,982 --> 01:44:05,416
Dear Lord,

586
01:44:05,416 --> 01:44:08,086
I present this lost boy to you

587
01:44:08,086 --> 01:44:10,121
so that he may be baptised,

588
01:44:10,121 --> 01:44:12,023
and join your flock.

589
01:44:20,865 --> 01:44:22,766
May this water

590
01:44:22,766 --> 01:44:25,003
from your heart

591
01:44:25,003 --> 01:44:27,171
wash away all his sins.

592
01:44:38,049 --> 01:44:41,085
After his resurrection,

593
01:44:41,085 --> 01:44:43,554
Jesus told his disciples,

594
01:44:43,554 --> 01:44:45,990
"Go forth.

595
01:44:48,259 --> 01:44:50,995
"Teach all nations."

596
01:44:52,196 --> 01:44:53,631
"Baptise them."

597
01:45:33,237 --> 01:45:35,473
I baptise thee,

598
01:45:35,473 --> 01:45:37,308
Francis.

599
01:47:13,905 --> 01:47:15,739
I made you these.

600
01:47:22,613 --> 01:47:24,215
Yeah.

601
01:47:58,549 --> 01:48:00,618
"Today,

602
01:48:00,618 --> 01:48:04,122
"we give thanks to God

603
01:48:04,122 --> 01:48:05,656
"for a great

604
01:48:05,656 --> 01:48:08,159
"deliverance.

605
01:48:09,828 --> 01:48:11,996
"The enemy,

606
01:48:11,996 --> 01:48:15,366
"who drove all Europe into war,

607
01:48:15,366 --> 01:48:17,568
"has been finally...

608
01:48:19,070 --> 01:48:21,205
"...overcome."

609
01:49:18,562 --> 01:49:20,631
Turn it around.
This way.

610
01:49:26,037 --> 01:49:28,572
Alright, okay, men.
Top of the hill and back.

611
01:49:28,572 --> 01:49:30,241
Alright.

612
01:49:31,609 --> 01:49:33,778
Hey! Leave it there.

613
01:49:44,122 --> 01:49:45,556
Let's go!

614
01:49:45,556 --> 01:49:48,426
Get! Go, boy, go! Go!

615
01:49:51,362 --> 01:49:53,331
-  Go, go, go!
-  Keep going!

616
01:49:53,331 --> 01:49:54,632
Run!

617
01:49:59,603 --> 01:50:03,174
Run!

618
01:50:20,324 --> 01:50:21,325
What?

619
01:50:21,325 --> 01:50:23,828
Go on. Go and turn around now.

620
01:50:23,828 --> 01:50:25,429
Turn around. Come back.

621
01:50:25,429 --> 01:50:27,799
- No, keep going.
-  Come back.

622
01:50:31,735 --> 01:50:33,404
-  Come back!
-  Keep going!

623
01:50:33,404 --> 01:50:35,473
- Come back! Turn around!
-  Keep going!

624
01:50:35,473 --> 01:50:37,308
- Come back!
- Where are they going?

625
01:50:37,308 --> 01:50:38,542
Keep going, keep going.

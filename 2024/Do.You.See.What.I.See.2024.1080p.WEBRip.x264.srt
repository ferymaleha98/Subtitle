00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:34,791
TUESDAY
NOVEMBER 25TH, 1986

4
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,333
{\an8}<i>Welcome to the short semester!</i>

5
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,500
{\an8}<i>I hope you don't have to repeat courses.</i>

6
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,541
<i>Our currency is depreciating fast,</i>

7
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,791
<i>tuition fees will be expensive as hell.</i>

8
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:53,833
<i>But enough talk about money,</i>
<i>fun stuff coming your way.</i>

9
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:59,458
{\an8}<i>Stay tuned to hear</i>
<i>your horoscope reading later by Miss Lin.</i>

10
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:04,000
{\an8}<i>Now it's time for "Dudu! From Me to You."</i>

11
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:11,083
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

12
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:19,541
{\an8}<i>We wish you a happy one</i>

13
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:27,291
{\an8}<i>May you live prosper and be healthy</i>

14
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:33,791
{\an8}<i>And be happy and live long</i>

15
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,041
No, Mawar! Stop!

16
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,333
Vey…

17
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,500
Can you hand me the pad from my bag?

18
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:29,916
Here you go.

19
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,416
Thanks.

20
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,750
Perfect.

21
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,416
You look gorgeous.

22
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:44,583
We picked the right dress.

23
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,166
It fits you nicely.

24
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,333
Wear this, for the extra oomph.

25
00:05:56,625 --> 00:06:01,625
You're looking prettier than ever,
let's go out and meet some boys!

26
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,375
I need to look pretty
to meet my parents, too.

27
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:06,708
You're going now?

28
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,166
It'll be too late.

29
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:12,250
Who turned this into a messy celebration?

30
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:13,875
Is Melati going?

31
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,041
She's busy.

32
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,041
She can't leave her dorm.

33
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,833
Not even for her sister's birthday.

34
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,375
Babe, I'm coming in, okay?

35
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,083
Hey, you can't!

36
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,416
Why not?

37
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,000
See?

38
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,125
She's decent.

39
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,791
So, Mawar…

40
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,000
The birthday feast is tomorrow night?

41
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,208
Of course! Promise.

42
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:38,416
Deal!

43
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:42,541
All right, then. I'm going home.
Don't be too late.

44
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,166
I'm catching a ride with you. Okay?

45
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,625
- I'm going ahead.
- Bye!

46
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,416
Let's go home.

47
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:03,666
Mom, Dad…

48
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:07,750
Sorry for coming in so late.

49
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:12,083
Do you remember…

50
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:16,083
it's my birthday today?

51
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,750
Don't you miss me?

52
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,000
I miss you so bad.

53
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:29,291
Melati misses you too, Dad, Mom.

54
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,250
Dad…

55
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,208
do you remember?

56
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:46,416
Mom used to bake us a cake
for our birthdays.

57
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,916
They were so good.

58
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:59,250
I've tried everywhere and still
can't find one as good as Mom's.

59
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:14,500
Well…

60
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,375
I shouldn't be feeling sad.

61
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,416
Besides Mom's cake…

62
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,583
what else should I wish for?

63
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,250
Maybe a boyfriend?

64
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,083
Am I allowed one now?

65
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,500
I turned 20 today.

66
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,500
Do I have your blessing?

67
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:52,625
Yes?

68
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,916
Thank God.

69
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,291
I pray

70
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:07,458
for a boyfriend who loves me.

71
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,625
Someone who cares deeply…

72
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,375
and who will always be there for me.

73
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,375
Just like you two had each other.

74
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,208
Amen.

75
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,791
Amen.

76
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,291
Amen.

77
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,250
I have to leave now, Dad, Mom.

78
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,708
You shouldn't have, Mpok Atik.

79
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,750
Listen, this is a reminder I'll be
locking the gate at 10:00 p.m. sharp!

80
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,166
Well noted. Don't worry.

81
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,208
Thanks, Mpok.

82
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,291
Has Mawar come home yet?

83
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:16,958
Where is she?

84
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,166
At her parents' grave.

85
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,875
This late, babe?

86
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:21,875
She visits on her birthday,

87
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,916
she must miss her parents more.

88
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:25,791
Poor girl.

89
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:27,666
Her parents are gone,

90
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:29,833
her sister is far away,

91
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:32,416
and she's single.

92
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:36,958
Hook her up then with one of your boys.

93
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,958
Just someone less annoying than you.

94
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,500
Let me take her to a club.

95
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,958
Are you still clubbing?
You said you'd stopped.

96
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:51,083
Are you guys talking about me?

97
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:54,291
Alex wants to take you clubbing.

98
00:13:58,625 --> 00:13:59,666
What's going on?

99
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,750
What is that smile on your face?

100
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,291
Nothing.

101
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,791
Did somebody give you a ride home?
A boy perhaps?

102
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,458
No.

103
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:14,666
I swear!

104
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,416
Mawar is wearing perfume.

105
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,458
What? No, Tika.

106
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:22,375
I can smell it from here.

107
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:23,500
No.

108
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:25,416
Mawar!

109
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,916
Mawar, we're not done. Spill, Mawar!

110
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,000
Tell us! We've embarrassed her.

111
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,333
Hello, who is this?

112
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,541
Who is this?

113
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,291
Mawar!

114
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,208
You're still up?

115
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:29,541
That was a prank call, just ignore it.

116
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:53,750
Did the prankster call again last night?

117
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,250
Maybe it was your mysterious boyfriend?

118
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:03,916
He must've hung up
when it wasn't you who answered.

119
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,166
A late night phone call, I see.

120
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,208
Mawar has a boyfriend?

121
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,791
When's your turn, Kartika?

122
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,458
Why me now?

123
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,333
Answer the question, Tika.

124
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:17,458
Tupac is my only man.

125
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,041
Look, your nose is bleeding.

126
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,500
Oh no, Mawar.

127
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,708
You promised you'd tell me anything.

128
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,583
What are you talking about?

129
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,791
We're not dating yet.

130
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,791
We just met.

131
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,000
But…

132
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:49,916
we clicked right away.

133
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,208
Like we have known each other.

134
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,791
What are you feeling now?

135
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,291
Well…

136
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,208
Happy.

137
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,166
Feels like I'm no longer alone.

138
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:24,625
So he's going to be
your very first boyfriend.

139
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:33,666
Well done, Mawar. It's your first love!

140
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,041
Stop it.

141
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:38,166
- Well done, Mawar!
- You're making me blush.

142
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,208
Mawar?

143
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:30,500
He's cheating.

144
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:31,875
What do you mean?

145
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,083
Hey.

146
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,500
What's wrong with your friend?
On her period?

147
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:02,750
Who was that?

148
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,458
That was Miss Lin, the campus' psychic.

149
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,666
She has that show on our radio.

150
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,916
Kartika knows her, too.

151
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,833
I told you about her. You don't remember?

152
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,166
You must've forgotten.

153
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:26,500
The food is here, but Mawar isn't.

154
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,375
Where is she, anyway?

155
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,458
I'm starving.

156
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,458
Let's not wait for her.

157
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,583
Maybe she's on a dinner date
with her boyfriend. Right?

158
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,875
By the way, who is her boyfriend?

159
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,625
You both are closer to her.

160
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,958
Nosy, much?

161
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:48,666
I'm curious, that's why I asked.

162
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,208
Hey! Use the plate.

163
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:54,750
Thanks, Mpok.

164
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:55,958
Thanks, Mpok.

165
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:57,916
Dig in.

166
00:20:58,791 --> 00:20:59,791
Here you go.

167
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,416
Miss! Let me help you.

168
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,666
No need.

169
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:30,291
This is for my guest.

170
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:51,708
Please remind your guest of the time.

171
00:23:51,791 --> 00:23:53,041
I'm locking the gate soon.

172
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:09,041
See, it's hot!

173
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:36,625
Really! They didn't even drink the coffee!

174
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:38,958
That took effort, too!
See if they come back.

175
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:40,916
Good morning, Mpok Atik.

176
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:43,250
Hey! Shoes, shoes. Shoes!

177
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:45,416
All right, no problem. Easy peasy.

178
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:47,541
I'll just take them off.

179
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:51,250
Don't pout.
I want to see your pretty face.

180
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:54,833
Smile for me, all right? Beautiful.

181
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:00,458
Mpok.

182
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:04,250
Can I come up for a sec?

183
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:06,041
I swear I won't go in Vey's room.

184
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:08,416
Okay?

185
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:27,541
Do you want me to walk you out?

186
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:14,208
What's wrong?

187
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:18,666
Nothing.

188
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:21,916
Let's go.

189
00:26:35,458 --> 00:26:36,666
Want to go with us?

190
00:26:40,583 --> 00:26:42,125
Drop by the radio station.

191
00:26:42,208 --> 00:26:43,416
Tika's broadcasting.

192
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,041
We promised her.

193
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:55,958
Hello, Biru's friends.

194
00:26:56,041 --> 00:26:59,500
Lunchtime is almost over.

195
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:03,458
But before we go back to our classes,
let's do some

196
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:06,916
"Dudu, From Me to You"!

197
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,708
I think someone's on the line right now.

198
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,083
Hello. Name and location?

199
00:27:19,791 --> 00:27:21,958
Hello, your name and location, please?

200
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:23,250
Any song requests?

201
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:25,541
Or maybe you want to greet
someone on the air?

202
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:39,708
Well, Biru's friends,
I think we have a shy caller here, so…

203
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,791
<i>From Restu…</i>

204
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,125
<i>to Mawar.</i>

205
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:10,333
Mawar?

206
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:13,666
Mawar from Anthropology, Class of '94?

207
00:28:14,791 --> 00:28:17,375
- What do you want to say to Mawar--
<i>- Keep…</i>

208
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:20,250
<i>our promise.</i>

209
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:36,541
Well, Biru's friends, that was a message
from Restu to Mawar.

210
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:39,875
He said, "Keep our promise."

211
00:28:40,125 --> 00:28:43,333
Yes, Restu, that was smooth.

212
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:48,333
Have you noticed
Mawar is acting strange lately?

213
00:28:51,291 --> 00:28:53,458
She bailed on us multiple times.

214
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:56,250
She never joins us at the house.

215
00:28:57,333 --> 00:28:59,333
- I think--
- Did you hear my broadcast?

216
00:28:59,916 --> 00:29:00,958
Tika…

217
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:04,041
This might have something
to do with Mawar.

218
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:07,208
Is there anybody
on our campus named Restu?

219
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:10,791
He called in and sent a message for Mawar.

220
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:12,375
I think that's her boyfriend.

221
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:14,125
Restu?

222
00:29:14,875 --> 00:29:15,958
From which faculty?

223
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:18,375
He didn't say.

224
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:28,625
Have you seen Mawar?

225
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:30,791
She hasn't been here for two days.

226
00:29:30,875 --> 00:29:33,000
I haven't seen her around.

227
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:38,458
Do you know Restu?

228
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:40,250
<i>Restu?</i>

229
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:42,375
{\an8}Yeah, do we have any "Restu"
on our campus?

230
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:45,750
{\an8}<i>It's not like I know everybody</i>
<i>on our campus.</i>

231
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:48,000
{\an8}<i>But I'll ask around, okay?</i>

232
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:52,750
<i>Babe.</i>

233
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:54,583
<i>Did you…</i>

234
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:58,583
<i>Did you ever see</i>
<i>Mawar with a guy in her room?</i>

235
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:01,875
What do you mean?

236
00:30:03,458 --> 00:30:06,291
<i>Nothing. Forget I asked, babe.</i>
<i>I have to go.</i>

237
00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:08,791
<i>Go to bed, don't worry about her.</i>

238
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:14,958
Quoting Harman and Chomsky from 1988.

239
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:19,958
This type of situation created
dissatisfaction among the citizens

240
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:23,041
that was reflected
in the new wave of journalism.

241
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:27,708
Such as public journalism and
peace journalism as a response to…

242
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:38,083
Mawar?

243
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:53,708
<i>Quoting Harman and Chomsky from 1988.</i>

244
00:31:54,583 --> 00:31:58,916
<i>The situation created dissatisfaction</i>
<i>among the citizens…</i>

245
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:03,083
<i>Restu, promise not to ever leave me.</i>

246
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:06,750
<i>You're all I have in this world.</i>

247
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,208
<i>I promise…</i>

248
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:13,041
<i>I will follow you wherever you go.</i>

249
00:32:53,041 --> 00:32:54,083
Mawar?

250
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,041
Mawar?

251
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:16,541
Who were you talking to?

252
00:33:17,833 --> 00:33:19,041
The gate is locked.

253
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,791
Your boyfriend?

254
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:24,583
Have you been inviting him in?

255
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,541
Even to your room?

256
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:31,083
Who is he?

257
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:33,625
Is his name Restu?

258
00:33:51,416 --> 00:33:55,375
<i>Restu, promise not to ever leave me.</i>

259
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:59,000
<i>You're all I have in this world.</i>

260
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,500
<i>I promise…</i>

261
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:05,375
<i>I will follow you wherever you go.</i>

262
00:34:09,708 --> 00:34:11,000
I have asked around.

263
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:15,958
There are three Restus on our campus.

264
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:17,791
First one, a literature major.

265
00:34:18,583 --> 00:34:19,708
He has a girlfriend.

266
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,500
The second one is Restu Wulandari.

267
00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:23,750
A girl.

268
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:26,291
The last one…

269
00:34:26,791 --> 00:34:27,916
dropped out.

270
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:31,250
Two years ago.

271
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:36,708
Wait a second.

272
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,916
Hey, babe.

273
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,333
Thinking about Mawar?

274
00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:51,625
The other day,

275
00:34:52,833 --> 00:34:56,416
I saw an eye peeking out
from Mawar's window.

276
00:34:59,375 --> 00:35:00,416
When was this?

277
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:02,083
You didn't say anything.

278
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:06,000
When I came to pick you up last time.

279
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,791
Can you describe the eye?

280
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:09,916
Well…

281
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,458
It was too quick.

282
00:35:12,458 --> 00:35:14,166
- But Lina said--
- Lina? Miss Lin?

283
00:35:15,041 --> 00:35:16,625
Yeah, not important, when Mawar--

284
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:17,583
What did she say?

285
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,125
It's not important, babe.

286
00:35:20,958 --> 00:35:22,083
What's with you?

287
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:38,500
- Babe?
- Are you really a psychic?

288
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:42,041
Hey, stop it. Let's go home.

289
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,458
What did you say about Mawar?

290
00:35:48,166 --> 00:35:49,916
Can we talk somewhere else?

291
00:35:56,041 --> 00:35:57,166
You stay there.

292
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:02,000
Alex.

293
00:36:02,166 --> 00:36:05,958
He said he saw something
in your friend's room.

294
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:09,291
So I did a cleansing ritual on him.

295
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:11,625
That's all.

296
00:36:14,291 --> 00:36:16,125
Was what he saw supernatural?

297
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:20,958
Because my friend
has been acting strange lately.

298
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:26,291
Mawar started to change
since she has a boyfriend.

299
00:36:28,458 --> 00:36:30,833
It started after she visited
her parents' grave.

300
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:33,583
Was there anything unusual…

301
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:35,625
when she went there?

302
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:38,083
She went there too late…

303
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:40,416
despite our warning.

304
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,791
She was on her period.

305
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,166
That night…

306
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,500
did she bring something home?

307
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:02,458
What do you mean?

308
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,375
I see…

309
00:37:21,958 --> 00:37:24,250
a wooden box.

310
00:37:26,166 --> 00:37:28,041
You can start by looking for the box.

311
00:37:28,875 --> 00:37:29,916
If it exists…

312
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:34,208
there might be spirits
attaching themselves to her,

313
00:37:34,583 --> 00:37:36,500
or someone put a spell on her.

314
00:37:38,375 --> 00:37:40,458
Only then could we be certain.

315
00:37:55,875 --> 00:37:56,916
Mpok.

316
00:37:57,625 --> 00:37:59,125
You're home early.

317
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:02,458
Isn't Mawar home?

318
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:04,833
I think she is out.

319
00:38:06,541 --> 00:38:08,916
Can I borrow the spare key to her room?

320
00:38:10,166 --> 00:38:11,375
I need to get something.

321
00:38:14,791 --> 00:38:16,625
Please, Mpok? She said it's okay.

322
00:39:51,916 --> 00:39:53,041
Why are you in my room?

323
00:39:54,916 --> 00:39:56,500
I'm worried about your boyfriend.

324
00:39:58,125 --> 00:40:00,500
Stay out of it.

325
00:40:00,958 --> 00:40:02,166
You don't know him.

326
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:03,625
You never introduced him.

327
00:40:03,708 --> 00:40:05,625
Do you really know him though?

328
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:08,625
Where he's from, what his background is?

329
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,625
- Does Melati know?
- Don't drag her into this.

330
00:40:29,791 --> 00:40:32,500
We don't want you
to get involved with the wrong guy.

331
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,041
His name is Restu.

332
00:40:39,666 --> 00:40:40,958
He's a good person.

333
00:40:46,375 --> 00:40:47,291
Mawar, your ear!

334
00:40:47,375 --> 00:40:48,750
Leave me alone!

335
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:07,041
<i>Now on to international news.</i>

336
00:41:07,125 --> 00:41:11,583
<i>In the evening of Saturday,</i>
<i>September 7th, 1996,</i>

337
00:41:11,666 --> 00:41:16,416
<i>famous rapper Tupac Shakur was gunned down</i>

338
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:20,000
<i>in his vehicle in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.</i>

339
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:25,833
<i>Tupac is in critical condition</i>
<i>and under doctors' intensive care.</i>

340
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,083
<i>In the meantime,</i>
<i>local authorities are still investigating…</i>

341
00:41:30,166 --> 00:41:31,291
I don't get it.

342
00:41:32,166 --> 00:41:34,291
Something is wrong with her boyfriend.

343
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,166
He's a bad influence on her.

344
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:38,083
I talked about Mawar with Lina.

345
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:40,291
And she said something is odd.

346
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:42,125
Did you find another Restu?

347
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,375
- Because I'm positive Mawar--
- Vey!

348
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:50,583
I don't want to talk about
Mawar right now.

349
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,416
I'm grieving.

350
00:44:02,958 --> 00:44:04,041
Who is it?

351
00:47:34,625 --> 00:47:36,541
Vey!

352
00:47:36,708 --> 00:47:37,750
What's the matter?

353
00:47:38,541 --> 00:47:40,000
- What's wrong?
- It's…

354
00:47:41,916 --> 00:47:42,958
What?

355
00:48:29,375 --> 00:48:30,416
A spirit…

356
00:48:32,333 --> 00:48:34,000
is attached to your friend.

357
00:48:36,583 --> 00:48:37,791
What kind of spirit?

358
00:48:44,708 --> 00:48:45,916
You really want to see?

359
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,583
I still don't understand.

360
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,416
So according to Miss Lin,

361
00:48:58,666 --> 00:49:01,000
scattering moringa leaves will let us see?

362
00:49:03,375 --> 00:49:04,666
What the hell is going on?

363
00:49:06,958 --> 00:49:10,166
What has Mawar's boyfriend done?
Put a spell on her?

364
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,208
I don't understand.

365
00:49:13,625 --> 00:49:15,041
Neither do we, Don.

366
00:49:15,541 --> 00:49:17,500
We're doing this to be sure.

367
00:49:18,125 --> 00:49:19,500
Just in case Lina is right.

368
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:22,625
That something is attached to Mawar now.
Or followed her home.

369
00:49:22,708 --> 00:49:23,916
Something, what?

370
00:49:25,208 --> 00:49:26,500
Spirits, Mpok.

371
00:49:27,375 --> 00:49:29,416
What are you talking about?

372
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:31,041
Ghosts.

373
00:49:32,875 --> 00:49:34,375
Hey, watch what you say.

374
00:49:35,125 --> 00:49:37,666
I also felt something strange last night.

375
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:47,791
Me too.

376
00:49:48,791 --> 00:49:49,833
Me too.

377
00:49:55,666 --> 00:49:57,500
We have to save Mawar

378
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,625
from whatever makes her this way.

379
00:50:04,666 --> 00:50:06,166
Oh, no. My laundry upstairs!

380
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:07,541
Laundry. My laundry!

381
00:51:10,375 --> 00:51:11,583
- Mpok.
- Mpok.

382
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,125
- Mpok!
- God forgive me!

383
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:20,000
Mpok, what happened?

384
00:51:20,958 --> 00:51:22,375
Mpok, what happened?

385
00:51:22,458 --> 00:51:25,583
What's wrong? Mpok?

386
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:27,833
There's… there's…

387
00:51:27,916 --> 00:51:29,291
What is it, Mpok?

388
00:51:29,833 --> 00:51:30,958
What is it, Mpok?

389
00:51:31,041 --> 00:51:32,416
There!

390
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:33,875
There!

391
00:51:33,958 --> 00:51:36,875
God forgive me. God forgive me.

392
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:47,500
Slowly, slowly. Sit here.

393
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:04,375
Mawar.

394
00:52:05,208 --> 00:52:06,250
Wake up!

395
00:52:06,875 --> 00:52:08,291
Your boyfriend is no good!

396
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:09,625
Look at Mpok Atik!

397
00:52:10,416 --> 00:52:12,333
What if we're all next?

398
00:52:14,583 --> 00:52:15,958
Dona's right, Mawar.

399
00:52:17,083 --> 00:52:18,625
Let us help you, okay?

400
00:52:19,541 --> 00:52:21,458
We're very concerned about you, Mawar.

401
00:52:23,083 --> 00:52:24,541
We want you to be okay.

402
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,875
- We're afraid your boyfriend--
- Restu.

403
00:52:32,291 --> 00:52:34,083
He's a good guy.

404
00:52:35,291 --> 00:52:37,041
So can we meet him?

405
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:41,250
What for?

406
00:52:43,708 --> 00:52:45,208
Because we care about you.

407
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:16,541
This one has a boyfriend…

408
00:53:17,291 --> 00:53:19,291
who cheats on her.

409
00:53:25,083 --> 00:53:28,750
This one has an idol…

410
00:53:29,625 --> 00:53:31,250
who is dead.

411
00:53:32,333 --> 00:53:33,833
Got killed.

412
00:53:41,083 --> 00:53:42,458
And this one…

413
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:45,500
doesn't even have anybody.

414
00:53:46,083 --> 00:53:48,500
So she pokes her nose into
other people's business!

415
00:53:52,583 --> 00:53:55,125
I have Restu.

416
00:53:59,291 --> 00:54:01,750
If you want to see him…

417
00:54:03,916 --> 00:54:05,875
he's coming tonight.

418
00:54:42,875 --> 00:54:43,916
Mawar.

419
00:54:45,416 --> 00:54:46,541
Isn't he coming?

420
00:54:50,708 --> 00:54:52,666
He will.

421
00:55:02,916 --> 00:55:03,958
Where did Mawar go?

422
00:55:07,166 --> 00:55:08,791
I'll go outside. You, her room.

423
00:55:09,625 --> 00:55:10,666
Where do we go, miss?

424
00:57:17,875 --> 00:57:18,916
Vey.

425
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:25,583
Come on in…

426
00:57:26,291 --> 00:57:28,291
let me introduce you to Restu.

427
00:57:59,125 --> 00:58:00,250
This is…

428
00:58:01,041 --> 00:58:02,791
Restu.

429
00:58:35,125 --> 00:58:36,250
What's wrong?

430
00:58:37,708 --> 00:58:38,750
Vey, what happened?

431
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:45,500
What are you doing here?

432
00:58:51,791 --> 00:58:55,500
Don't you want to meet Restu?

433
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:31,208
God forgive me.

434
00:59:34,375 --> 00:59:35,500
Mawar is outside.

435
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,541
You're still thinking about her?

436
00:59:37,625 --> 00:59:39,625
Didn't you see what's outside? Fuck.

437
00:59:40,041 --> 00:59:41,291
But she's in danger.

438
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:42,791
Vey!

439
00:59:43,583 --> 00:59:44,625
Vey!

440
01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:25,750
Vey!

441
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,041
Let's go!

442
01:02:43,833 --> 01:02:44,875
Mawar?

443
01:02:45,458 --> 01:02:46,500
Mawar!

444
01:03:02,458 --> 01:03:03,791
Mawar.

445
01:03:04,333 --> 01:03:05,375
Mawar! Hey!

446
01:03:06,375 --> 01:03:07,416
Hold her.

447
01:03:08,416 --> 01:03:10,208
- Mawar?
- Mawar…

448
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:17,250
Restu…

449
01:03:17,416 --> 01:03:20,208
Mawar. Please snap out of it.

450
01:03:21,916 --> 01:03:27,125
- Mawar…
- He's waiting for me outside, Vey.

451
01:03:27,416 --> 01:03:29,000
Mawar, snap out of it.

452
01:03:29,583 --> 01:03:32,208
Mawar, please. Restu is not human.

453
01:03:34,375 --> 01:03:36,083
Wake up, Mawar.

454
01:03:37,375 --> 01:03:39,375
Mawar… Mawar…

455
01:03:41,458 --> 01:03:43,250
Restu…

456
01:03:43,333 --> 01:03:47,291
Mawar… Mawar…

457
01:03:48,541 --> 01:03:53,083
Vey, Restu is waiting for me.

458
01:03:53,166 --> 01:03:54,666
Mawar, snap out of it.

459
01:03:57,333 --> 01:04:01,333
Restu, come and take me with you!

460
01:04:01,416 --> 01:04:02,625
- Mawar!
- Mawar.

461
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:04,625
Mawar!

462
01:04:11,416 --> 01:04:12,541
Mawar!

463
01:04:16,958 --> 01:04:19,375
- Vey!
- Mawar!

464
01:04:19,458 --> 01:04:21,000
Dona, get a rope!

465
01:04:21,708 --> 01:04:22,750
Hurry!

466
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:27,625
Her name is Melati.

467
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,208
Tell her to come
as soon as she can. Tonight.

468
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:35,500
Where are you going?

469
01:04:44,458 --> 01:04:45,625
What are you doing here?

470
01:04:46,375 --> 01:04:47,416
Lin…

471
01:04:48,958 --> 01:04:50,375
Babe, I can explain.

472
01:04:50,458 --> 01:04:51,500
I don't give a damn.

473
01:04:52,375 --> 01:04:53,625
I just need her help.

474
01:04:54,416 --> 01:04:55,458
What is it?

475
01:04:56,666 --> 01:04:58,125
It's actually worse.

476
01:05:00,166 --> 01:05:01,583
She's in love with the demon.

477
01:05:06,083 --> 01:05:07,291
If you're feeling bad…

478
01:05:09,333 --> 01:05:10,750
now you can make it right.

479
01:05:19,333 --> 01:05:20,375
Wait.

480
01:05:23,416 --> 01:05:24,916
Hey… Babe!

481
01:05:50,125 --> 01:05:51,875
Vey.

482
01:05:53,083 --> 01:05:56,666
Help me.

483
01:05:58,125 --> 01:05:59,541
Vey…

484
01:06:17,208 --> 01:06:18,291
Those moringa leaves,

485
01:06:20,375 --> 01:06:22,583
the string you showed me, and a shroud.

486
01:07:06,583 --> 01:07:07,625
Vey.

487
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:10,583
They're ready.

488
01:08:11,666 --> 01:08:12,708
Lin.

489
01:08:16,958 --> 01:08:18,083
Put her on the shroud.

490
01:08:51,708 --> 01:08:52,750
Mawar!

491
01:08:53,791 --> 01:08:54,916
Mawar!

492
01:09:11,083 --> 01:09:12,875
Lock the door, Mpok!

493
01:09:21,958 --> 01:09:23,708
Kartika, get the moringa leaves!

494
01:11:33,458 --> 01:11:34,500
Mawar.

495
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:39,541
Mawar?

496
01:12:12,458 --> 01:12:14,708
Tik, Mawar is gone, Tik.

497
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:16,500
Tik, Mawar's gone.

498
01:12:18,958 --> 01:12:20,083
I'll look in her room.

499
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:21,291
I'll look outside.

500
01:12:21,958 --> 01:12:23,000
Mpok, the key.

501
01:12:35,375 --> 01:12:36,416
Vey?

502
01:12:38,916 --> 01:12:39,958
What's going on?

503
01:12:44,333 --> 01:12:45,541
What happened to Mawar?

504
01:12:48,416 --> 01:12:49,458
Mawar…

505
01:12:52,916 --> 01:12:54,541
Forgive me, Mel.

506
01:12:57,208 --> 01:12:58,416
So…

507
01:13:00,375 --> 01:13:01,750
my sister…

508
01:13:03,416 --> 01:13:04,791
is in love…

509
01:13:06,416 --> 01:13:07,458
with a demon?

510
01:13:09,541 --> 01:13:10,958
Mawar started acting strange

511
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:15,625
after visiting your parents' grave.

512
01:13:29,375 --> 01:13:30,416
Your family…

513
01:13:34,333 --> 01:13:36,250
there's a connection with this demon.

514
01:13:37,083 --> 01:13:38,125
What do you mean?

515
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,208
Your parents' house.

516
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,166
Restu is going there.

517
01:13:44,583 --> 01:13:46,083
Taking Mawar with him.

518
01:13:57,416 --> 01:13:58,625
You're useful after all.

519
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:09,791
Vey, sure you don't want me
to go with you?

520
01:14:11,291 --> 01:14:12,333
It's okay, Dona.

521
01:14:12,916 --> 01:14:15,416
Stay here with Mpok Atik.
Keep each other safe.

522
01:14:18,333 --> 01:14:19,375
We're going.

523
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:23,875
Babe.

524
01:14:24,541 --> 01:14:25,583
Not now.

525
01:14:57,708 --> 01:14:59,250
Let's go.

526
01:15:43,625 --> 01:15:46,125
Hey! Oi!

527
01:15:46,666 --> 01:15:47,708
What should I do?

528
01:15:49,291 --> 01:15:50,166
Wait here.

529
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:51,875
If we don't come out, come inside.

530
01:16:08,041 --> 01:16:09,333
Mawar?

531
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:12,875
Mawar?

532
01:16:18,583 --> 01:16:19,625
Let's split up.

533
01:16:29,375 --> 01:16:30,583
Mawar!

534
01:16:39,833 --> 01:16:41,125
Mawar?

535
01:17:31,333 --> 01:17:32,500
What's behind that door?

536
01:19:09,833 --> 01:19:12,208
Mawar was here on her birthday.

537
01:19:15,416 --> 01:19:16,458
Is this…

538
01:19:18,416 --> 01:19:19,541
your father's room?

539
01:19:20,833 --> 01:19:22,083
I don't know.

540
01:19:22,625 --> 01:19:24,833
I didn't even know
about this room until now.

541
01:19:33,416 --> 01:19:34,541
As I suspected.

542
01:19:36,750 --> 01:19:38,125
This was a ritual…

543
01:19:40,958 --> 01:19:42,333
for good fortune…

544
01:19:43,625 --> 01:19:44,750
and prosperity.

545
01:19:47,250 --> 01:19:50,125
A ritual that involved a corpse like this…

546
01:19:51,791 --> 01:19:57,958
The spirit of the corpse
will attach himself to the family members…

547
01:20:02,791 --> 01:20:05,416
for a thousand years.

548
01:20:13,083 --> 01:20:15,000
And the person who performed the ritual…

549
01:20:15,875 --> 01:20:19,166
must be buried in the same spot
where he dug the corpse out from.

550
01:20:22,583 --> 01:20:23,958
That's impossible.

551
01:20:24,541 --> 01:20:25,708
It can't be.

552
01:20:27,208 --> 01:20:29,166
My father was a good man.

553
01:20:30,458 --> 01:20:33,541
He would never have anything to do
with the demon.

554
01:20:36,708 --> 01:20:38,041
Now what?

555
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,250
Where is Mawar, then?

556
01:20:41,541 --> 01:20:45,458
We have to return the corpse to his grave.

557
01:20:48,625 --> 01:20:51,458
Are your parents buried in the same grave?

558
01:20:54,166 --> 01:20:55,625
My father…

559
01:20:56,625 --> 01:20:59,625
asked to be buried on top of my mother.

560
01:21:00,833 --> 01:21:02,500
Take us to your parents' grave.

561
01:21:05,916 --> 01:21:08,291
What are you going to do
with my parents' grave?

562
01:21:08,375 --> 01:21:09,875
It was Restu's grave first!

563
01:21:10,666 --> 01:21:13,041
Your father dug this corpse out
from that grave.

564
01:21:42,208 --> 01:21:43,500
Vey, the string!

565
01:21:43,583 --> 01:21:44,791
Tie it on top!

566
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:58,458
Babe?

567
01:21:58,541 --> 01:22:02,083
Lex, tie this string around the shroud
on top of his head.

568
01:22:25,833 --> 01:22:26,875
Babe.

569
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,041
Lin!

570
01:22:37,791 --> 01:22:39,333
Why do I have to carry this?

571
01:22:42,083 --> 01:22:43,125
A little help here?

572
01:23:08,833 --> 01:23:09,875
Tika?

573
01:23:11,583 --> 01:23:12,625
Lina?

574
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:25,625
Mawar?

575
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:32,750
Sis, be careful! Wait!

576
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:35,541
Mawar!

577
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,041
Vey!

578
01:23:41,208 --> 01:23:43,500
We lost Vey and Melati.

579
01:23:44,333 --> 01:23:45,500
Alex is gone, too.

580
01:23:47,833 --> 01:23:49,750
Did that asshole go back to the car?

581
01:23:50,083 --> 01:23:51,125
Vey!

582
01:23:55,708 --> 01:23:57,250
Damn it.

583
01:23:58,333 --> 01:24:00,625
Why am I stuck with this freaking corpse?

584
01:24:23,625 --> 01:24:24,666
Vey!

585
01:24:29,333 --> 01:24:30,375
Lina!

586
01:24:36,166 --> 01:24:37,208
Babe!

587
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:56,458
Mawar!

588
01:24:56,666 --> 01:24:57,791
Sis!

589
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:01,541
Mawar!

590
01:25:01,916 --> 01:25:03,083
Sis!

591
01:25:07,333 --> 01:25:08,375
Mawar!

592
01:25:08,625 --> 01:25:09,833
Sis!

593
01:25:14,791 --> 01:25:16,833
Where else should we look for her?

594
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:22,708
Your parents' grave.

595
01:26:04,625 --> 01:26:06,083
Vey…

596
01:26:06,416 --> 01:26:07,500
They are all the same…

597
01:26:44,333 --> 01:26:47,333
Lin, the headstones are all the same
with the same names.

598
01:26:54,833 --> 01:26:55,875
Kar…

599
01:26:57,750 --> 01:26:58,791
don't look left.

600
01:27:03,541 --> 01:27:04,583
Walk straight ahead.

601
01:28:02,958 --> 01:28:04,000
Follow them.

602
01:28:05,166 --> 01:28:06,208
Seriously?

603
01:28:43,333 --> 01:28:44,625
Maybe it's our fault.

604
01:28:52,333 --> 01:28:53,375
Mawar.

605
01:28:55,875 --> 01:28:57,458
Please forgive us.

606
01:29:01,458 --> 01:29:05,583
Give us a chance to see you one more time.

607
01:29:08,833 --> 01:29:10,916
Before you go with Restu.

608
01:29:15,916 --> 01:29:17,541
Please, Mawar.

609
01:29:18,875 --> 01:29:22,958
Please, for the last time,
we want to see you.

610
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:53,416
Hey, punk, what the hell did you eat
when you were alive?

611
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:55,541
You're heavy as fuck.

612
01:30:03,916 --> 01:30:08,958
God damn it, what now?

613
01:30:15,708 --> 01:30:17,708
Stay away, stay away, stay away…

614
01:30:18,041 --> 01:30:25,041
Stay away, stay away, stay away…

615
01:30:37,375 --> 01:30:38,500
- Lex!
- Shit!

616
01:30:39,166 --> 01:30:42,333
You guys suck!
I should've waited in the car!

617
01:30:42,583 --> 01:30:44,958
We suddenly lost everybody, too!

618
01:30:45,375 --> 01:30:46,416
Vey and Melati?

619
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:48,291
How should I know, bitch?

620
01:30:48,750 --> 01:30:50,833
Tika! Lina!

621
01:30:53,166 --> 01:30:54,208
Vey!

622
01:30:54,791 --> 01:30:55,958
Where have you been?

623
01:31:00,333 --> 01:31:01,375
Look. The headstones…

624
01:31:14,750 --> 01:31:16,041
Go to your parents' grave.

625
01:31:25,458 --> 01:31:26,500
Over there!

626
01:32:34,750 --> 01:32:35,791
Mawar!

627
01:32:41,208 --> 01:32:42,250
Mawar!

628
01:32:43,208 --> 01:32:44,250
Mawar!

629
01:33:45,083 --> 01:33:46,125
Take off the string!

630
01:33:46,666 --> 01:33:47,750
- The strings!
- Okay.

631
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,250
Cover it with the boards.

632
01:34:02,708 --> 01:34:05,125
- Hurry up, Lex!
- I'm trying!

633
01:34:10,291 --> 01:34:11,125
Hold her!

634
01:34:34,166 --> 01:34:35,875
Restu!

635
01:34:36,625 --> 01:34:38,083
Restu!

636
01:34:38,250 --> 01:34:40,541
Restu!

637
01:34:48,958 --> 01:34:52,583
Restu!

638
01:34:54,916 --> 01:34:56,541
Lex, let's bury him!

639
01:35:12,083 --> 01:35:14,208
Sis, I need you!

640
01:35:15,416 --> 01:35:17,541
Mawar, we all love you!

641
01:35:24,458 --> 01:35:25,291
Sis!

642
01:35:28,833 --> 01:35:33,958
How dare you, bitch!

643
01:35:42,791 --> 01:35:43,958
Sis!

644
01:35:51,041 --> 01:35:54,208
Remember what we promised Father!

645
01:35:55,416 --> 01:35:58,041
Always take care of each other.

646
01:36:04,375 --> 01:36:06,916
We miss you, Mawar.

647
01:36:17,375 --> 01:36:19,416
Please hear us, Mawar.

648
01:36:20,958 --> 01:36:22,833
We need you in our lives.

649
01:36:30,458 --> 01:36:33,541
Please don't leave me.

650
01:36:34,875 --> 01:36:37,958
You're all I have.

Mawar.

685
01:43:12,375 --> 01:43:13,583
It's okay, sweetie.

686
01:43:16,083 --> 01:43:18,500
His name is Restu.

687
01:43:21,166 --> 01:43:23,500
He's going to save our family.

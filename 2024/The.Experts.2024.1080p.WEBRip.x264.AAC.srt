3
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:40,250
{\an8}Senior Yus.

4
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:44,040
{\an8}Do you know Malay martial arts?

5
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:45,915
{\an8}Yes, I do. Why?

6
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:49,582
{\an8}Well, I was actually
thinking about learning...

7
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,916
the art of self-defense.

8
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:53,707
<i>Jusoh to control center.</i>

9
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:55,290
<i>The cops are here for routine check.</i>

10
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:56,375
<i>We're scanning their IDs.</i>

11
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:00,624
The art of self-defense?

12
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:01,915
You've come to the right person.

13
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:03,374
- Really?
- Yes.

14
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:06,790
Back when I was 12,
I was a champion in Malay Silat.

15
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:08,832
District level.

16
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:11,374
After that, I learned Taekwondo...

17
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:14,208
<i>Control Unit,
I'm taking them to the CCTV room.</i>

18
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:17,582
Karate.

19
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:19,249
Wushu. Aikido.

20
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,165
Muay Thai.

21
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:21,624
Wing Chun.

22
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:23,124
Even Jeet Kune Do.

23
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,124
Oh wow. Jeet Kune Do!

24
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,707
Jeet Kune Do.

25
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:27,332
You know... Bruce?

26
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:28,957
Bruce Lee? Yes, yes.

27
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:30,915
I am developing my own...

28
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:32,332
"art of martial."

29
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:34,166
Art... martial.

30
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:37,874
Come. Let me show you.

31
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:41,207
Senior Yus. It's okay.

32
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:43,290
Danger is always lurking.

33
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:45,082
We have to always be ready...

34
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:46,999
- as <i>secutoret</i> guards.
- Se... security.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,665
Danger comes unannounced.

36
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:51,915
Look at that! The strong room.

37
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:53,790
Millions stored in it.

38
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:56,082
- But it's okay. I'm here.
- Senior Yus...

39
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,124
- Back in the day, I alone could take on...
- But...

40
00:01:58,125 --> 00:01:59,791
Senior Jusoh...

41
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:01,499
disappeared.

42
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,415
Where is Jusoh?

43
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:05,082
Senior Jusoh, come in. Senior Ju...

44
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,749
Peace be upon you. Police!

45
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,875
Police?

46
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:11,583
Just police protocol.

47
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,375
Let me handle it.

48
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,125
Yes, sir?

49
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:19,208
It's here.

50
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,500
Senior Yus!

51
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:24,750
What took you guys so long?

52
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:30,083
POLICE

53
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,499
<i>Angah, hurry up.</i>

54
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,083
Hang on!

55
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:39,957
Senior Yus!

56
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:40,999
Okay. Done.

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,625
Quiet!

58
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,290
He is not breathing, Long.

59
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,375
How's that possible with just a punch?

60
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,291
<i>Emma, someone is coming.</i>

61
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,500
Mr. Jusoh.

62
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:19,625
How about you...

63
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,583
put down that walkie-talkie
and we have a chat?

64
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,708
Control. Control Room, come in!

65
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:40,332
Keep it up!

66
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,500
Louder!

67
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,457
Now the shine...

68
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,083
One of a kind, Long.

69
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,833
What are we waiting for?

70
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,583
Wrap them all up.

71
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,333
{\an8}<i>Latest news. A daring heist
of 40 million ringgit...</i>

72
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:36,125
{\an8}<i>The biggest heist
in the history of Malaysia...</i>

73
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,916
<i>...and their whereabouts remain unknown.</i>

74
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:46,125
TEN YEARS LATER

75
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,624
Along.

76
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,708
Sure you don't want to come?

77
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,707
It's okay. Just go.

78
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:14,791
Okay.

79
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:34,166
Where's Arif and Sofia?

80
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,374
Along!

81
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:39,249
Arif and Sofia!

82
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,333
Kiss! Where are you going?

83
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:42,957
Emma!

84
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,458
That's a lot of stuff.
Where are you going?

85
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,083
What's wrong?

86
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,833
Never seen a hot babe behind the wheel?

87
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,083
It's not that I've never seen one.

88
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,041
It's just been a long time.

89
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,250
No wonder.

90
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,666
You look deprived.

91
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,041
Come here.

92
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,166
‎Long time...

93
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,416
Not my hair!

94
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:18,541
That's...

95
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,416
That's more like it.

96
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,624
You know...

97
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:24,833
I've waited ten years for this.

98
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:26,249
Hey!

99
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,999
Ten years and you haven't quit?

100
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,833
No need to smoke here.

101
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,124
Okay.

102
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,874
I can wait.

103
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,000
Let's go.

104
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,708
Or do you still want to sleep here?

105
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,916
‎What are you guys doing?
‎Please hand me the butter.

106
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,790
What is this nonsense?

107
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,332
Don't you get it?

108
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:56,041
Hello, there's 10,000 views here.

109
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,707
Broke my back.

110
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:13,915
Hang on, babe.

111
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,166
You've got to be tough to go viral.

112
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,208
I don't get this thing.

113
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,124
Keyrol.

114
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:22,457
Kids nowadays...

115
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,583
love to dance in front of their phone.

116
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,208
Give me a break.

117
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,000
What's important...

118
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,875
is people can see my art.

119
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:39,208
How can I compare to you...?

120
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,790
<i>Huh? IT? Hang on.</i>

121
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,082
<i>Six, seven.</i>

122
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,165
<i>Is this not maintenance?</i>

123
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,499
<i>- IT who?</i>
- IT Mana--

124
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,833
<i>Wrong extension.</i>

125
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,874
- Yes!
- You're very good, Angah.

126
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,249
Not like Emma. She only knows
how to part out cars.

127
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,707
Hey you.

128
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:30,332
Parting out a car is just her side hustle.

129
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,874
Now she has become

130
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,332
a film star!

131
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:37,874
I won't let you get hurt.

132
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:41,583
Even from a mosquito bite.

133
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,750
I got goosebumps.

134
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:47,874
Okay.

135
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:48,875
When...

136
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,041
Once he's done with his dialogue,

137
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,708
you stop the car...

138
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:55,333
with style.

139
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,249
Okay.

140
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,208
Slate 1014. Take 1.

141
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:19,291
<i>I won't let you get hurt.</i>

142
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:24,166
<i>Even from a mosquito bite.</i>

143
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:43,083
You just...

144
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:46,666
You?

145
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,624
Ten years in jail.
Surely you have good stories.

146
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:50,750
Tell us.

147
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,749
- Tell us.
- Tell us.

148
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,665
Nothing.

149
00:12:58,666 --> 00:12:59,957
Nothing? Just tell us.

150
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,207
It won't do any good anyway.

151
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,124
You!

152
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,499
Just tell us the story.

153
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,416
‎Tell us.

154
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,916
Okay.

155
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,125
There's a contact on the inside.

156
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,916
He says there are some
fresh goods worth RM 300,000.

157
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,250
RM 300,000 was it?

158
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,375
Wow!

159
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,333
Why?

160
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:36,583
Retired?

161
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:38,916
Listening to Along?

162
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:41,125
What about me?

163
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,250
Nothing, Long.

164
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,540
Keyrol.

165
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,541
Keyrol has...

166
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,665
Just say it.

167
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,457
He said he has an inside contact.

168
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,916
Ouch!

169
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:11,916
Let the story from inside stay there.

170
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,333
You're out now, right?

171
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,208
I'm just telling a story.

172
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,250
It's nothing more.

173
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,750
In the end you'll be the one
making the final decision, right?

174
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,000
You know, right?

175
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,999
The reason I made that call?

176
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,291
What was the reason?

177
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,750
Because of me?

178
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,000
- Or was it Dad?
- Keyrol.

179
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:50,874
There's no point talking.

180
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,250
Hey, Rol!

181
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,500
Rol!

182
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:01,791
Hey, Rol!

183
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:03,457
Where are you going?

184
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:04,874
Don't bother.

185
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:05,999
Relax, will you?

186
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,041
Along is just concerned about us.

187
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,208
What kind of concern is that?

188
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,707
All you guys do is listen to him.

189
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:22,790
You guys will just do
whatever he says, right?

190
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:26,082
Enough, Keyrol. What's past is past.

191
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,000
Let it go.

192
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:32,333
You're all as hard-headed
as your eldest brother.

193
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,333
You want me to die?
Face all of this alone?

194
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:41,832
Isn't there another way, Dad?

195
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,083
There is.

196
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:47,458
But I have to help the creditor.

197
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:49,791
Help?

198
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,416
What kind of help?

199
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,500
Dad!

200
00:16:58,458 --> 00:16:59,582
<i>So cool.</i>

201
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,708
<i>Cool, right?</i>

202
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,666
Take it.

203
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:25,875
<i>Peace be upon you.</i>

204
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:30,208
<i>Look familiar?</i>

205
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,291
<i>Let's meet.</i>

206
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,958
Why won't it hit?

207
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,083
You avoided it, didn't you?

208
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,291
Ball.

209
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,708
You think I don't know how to swing?

210
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,166
Let's fly.

211
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,541
The big brother!

212
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:20,916
Give me a moment.

213
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:27,583
Hey!

214
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:31,583
- We...
- What are you doing?

215
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,291
- We...
- I'm here, aren't I?

216
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,249
Let my brother go.

217
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,500
I don't want to.

218
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,124
Let him be. It's okay.

219
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:48,833
We'll take Lan's kids after this.

220
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:50,833
Then...

221
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,625
His sister, Emma.

222
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:58,666
Hey.

223
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,583
What is it that you actually want?

224
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:06,458
Where's the thing I asked for?

225
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:08,833
In the car.

226
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,915
Now that you've got what you wanted,

227
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:25,290
you stay away from my family.

228
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:26,208
You get it?

229
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,249
Wait a minute. This...

230
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,207
I think you've got it wrong.

231
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,874
That's just a deposit.

232
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,166
That's not the thing I actually wanted.

233
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,291
Come.

234
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:47,958
Come.

235
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,375
I'm sure you've heard of them before.

236
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:59,125
The family of Five Ivory.

237
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:07,125
In three days, there will be a party.

238
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:11,958
<i>It's weird, still feels weird</i>

239
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,958
They will appoint their new leader.

240
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:22,916
The ring will be there.

241
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,665
We don't do that kind of work anymore.

242
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:26,875
You can take it back.

243
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,082
What a snob.

244
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,915
You won't do it anymore.

245
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:37,416
Farid, you may be able
to hide from the law.

246
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:42,000
But there's no way you can hide from us.

247
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:56,625
Move.

248
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,166
Move.

249
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:12,666
How the hell was there
a bomb in your car? Damn!

250
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,041
Three days.

251
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,416
Don't get busted.

252
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,625
Peace be upon you.

253
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:55,416
Sorry guys, I am...

254
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:00,083
late.

255
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:03,957
Was it settled?

256
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:05,958
Yeah. I've sent them to my in-law's.

257
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:13,375
Truthfully, I don't
know how to tell you guys.

258
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,250
But we have a problem...

259
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,250
related to...

260
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:21,791
The Five Ivory gang.

261
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:23,583
Five Ivory?

262
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:33,290
This is a suicide mission.

263
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:36,290
You. The minute you get out,
you create trouble.

264
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:37,916
Along, don't we have other choices?

265
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:40,874
How did we get involved
with the Five Ivory Gang?

266
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:42,499
That's not important.

267
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,040
The point is we're now involved.

268
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:47,207
Like it or not, we have to do it

269
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:48,333
if we want to stay alive.

270
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,541
No.

271
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:52,541
I don't need to get involved.

272
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,625
If you're trying to run,

273
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:59,291
take us with you.

274
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:03,083
Right?

275
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:13,125
You!

276
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:14,458
‎Hey!

277
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:19,208
Proceed.

278
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:23,541
Okay. This is the information I have.

279
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:26,041
<i>Rahman Mustapha.
Head of the Five Ivory gang.</i>

280
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:29,665
<i>On the surface, he runs
a legit business as a coverup.</i>

281
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:31,249
<i>A hotel business.</i>

282
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,249
<i>Two weeks ago, he passed away.</i>

283
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,790
<i>His son, Bashir will take over.</i>

284
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:37,333
<i>Except it is not official yet.</i>

285
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:39,999
<i>In three days' time, at the Palace Hotel,</i>

286
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,582
<i>they will have a proper coronation</i>

287
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:45,499
<i>to appoint their new leader.</i>

288
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,749
<i>There, he will inherit the leader's ring.</i>

289
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,666
<i>Our job,</i>

290
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:54,500
is to steal the ring
before it gets to Bashir.

291
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:58,374
All this trouble to get us,
just to steal a ring?

292
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:01,124
Is not about how much the ring is worth.

293
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:04,374
Imagine a king ascending
the throne without a crown.

294
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:05,708
Would he still be the king?

295
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,207
<i>Between Bashir and the ring,</i>

296
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:10,665
<i>there are two important people
we need to know.</i>

297
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:14,082
<i>Firstly, the person
who is responsible for making sure</i>

298
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:16,040
<i>all his dirty businesses look legitimate.</i>

299
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:18,165
<i>Miranda Rahman.</i>

300
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:21,957
<i>How she keeps
the ledger clean is beyond me.</i>

301
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:23,915
<i>Secondly, Jaafar Mustapha.</i>

302
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:25,874
<i>Uncle to Bashir.</i>

303
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:28,457
<i>This old fox controls all</i>

304
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:30,041
<i>of Five Ivory's underground trading.</i>

305
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:32,415
The ring will be there an hour

306
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:33,915
before the ceremony starts.

307
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:37,624
Then, go straight to
the vault hidden under Palace Hotel.

308
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:39,208
The security of the vault

309
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:42,333
is among the most complex.

310
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:45,040
<i>In this hotel, there is only one corridor</i>

311
00:24:45,041 --> 00:24:46,374
<i>that leads to the vault's lift.</i>

312
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:49,499
<i>This is our only way to the ring.</i>

313
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,915
<i>But the elevator's floor
is pressure sensitive.</i>

314
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:54,207
<i>The moment someone enters</i>

315
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:56,415
<i>it activates a five-second countdown.</i>

316
00:24:56,416 --> 00:25:00,040
<i>Without the encrypted key,
the alarm will go off.</i>

317
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:04,041
<i>Only the head of security, Mizal, has it.</i>

318
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:10,624
<i>Down there, you'll be greeted
by a guard with a shotgun.</i>

319
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:14,375
<i>Disarm him and we'll
get access to their vault.</i>

320
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:18,124
<i>The entry only uses Miranda's thumbprint,</i>

321
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:19,583
<i>no one else's.</i>

322
00:25:22,916 --> 00:25:26,000
<i>The safe is in the vault.</i>

323
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:30,790
Fingerprint, access card,
pressure sensitive floor,

324
00:25:30,791 --> 00:25:33,374
security guards, safe. Wow!

325
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:35,332
Anything else you would like to add?

326
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,666
There are still the CCTVs.

327
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:41,707
Along, are you sure about this?
It's been a long time since we...

328
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:46,582
Yet, we have never failed
when we've worked together.

329
00:25:46,583 --> 00:25:49,500
I'll make sure it's
no different this time.

330
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:54,375
Shall we?

331
00:25:55,208 --> 00:25:56,041
Work.

332
00:25:59,416 --> 00:26:01,415
<i>The office hasn't been used for ten years.</i>

333
00:26:01,416 --> 00:26:02,875
<i>Some housekeeping is due, no doubt.</i>

334
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:06,165
<i>We've only got three days.</i>

335
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:07,375
<i>Don't slack off.</i>

336
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,708
Hey, take this.

337
00:26:10,916 --> 00:26:12,290
Work, you idiot!

338
00:26:12,291 --> 00:26:14,999
We've only got three days, moron!

339
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,291
Amer!

340
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:21,666
One...

341
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:47,458
Sign here, please.

342
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,458
Mr. Bashir.

343
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:03,416
<i>Step two, reconnaissance.</i>

344
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:07,290
<i>Rol, we need to know their movements.</i>

345
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:09,500
<i>How does it fit? Good?</i>

346
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:12,250
It fits perfectly.

347
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:15,625
Where else would the apple fall?

348
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,999
<i>The ring needs to be
resized for the new leader.</i>

349
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,624
<i>This morning, Bashir will be fitting it</i>

350
00:27:22,625 --> 00:27:24,582
<i>at Amee Philips, Bangsar.</i>

351
00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:26,915
<i>We need to know
their protocols in handling this ring,</i>

352
00:27:26,916 --> 00:27:29,708
<i>security details
and where they keep the ring.</i>

353
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:42,957
No. No.

354
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:44,250
No problem.

355
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:51,040
<i>Okay, lazy bum.</i>

356
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:52,957
<i>Get Miranda's
schedule for these three days</i>

357
00:27:52,958 --> 00:27:53,999
<i>leading up to the coronation.</i>

358
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,166
<i>From there, we will devise
a plan to steal her fingerprint.</i>

359
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:09,707
<i>Step three. Rol, you
and I will infiltrate their base.</i>

360
00:28:09,708 --> 00:28:12,249
<i>Our target, Mizal.</i>

361
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:15,457
<i>There must be a time
when the key isn't with him.</i>

362
00:28:15,458 --> 00:28:18,665
<i>I will create a distraction,
you'll clone the key.</i>

363
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:20,416
<i>And Lan, make a copy.</i>

364
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:39,458
What's happening?

365
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,915
Epy, what happened?

366
00:28:51,916 --> 00:28:54,624
I don't know. The alarm went off suddenly.

367
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:55,540
Huh?

368
00:28:55,541 --> 00:28:58,207
Suddenly, the alarm went off.

369
00:28:58,208 --> 00:28:59,249
Hey!

370
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,374
Can't you just switch it off?

371
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:02,832
Have you checked the exits?

372
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:04,625
- What?
- The exits!

373
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:06,832
Have you check them?

374
00:29:06,833 --> 00:29:08,790
Not yet.

375
00:29:08,791 --> 00:29:14,082
Turn this off.
Then go check Exit 12 to 16.

376
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:15,415
Huh?

377
00:29:15,416 --> 00:29:20,250
Check Exit 12 to 16.

378
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:22,791
Huh?

379
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:35,207
<i>Okay. Regarding Miranda.</i>

380
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:38,332
<i>Hold it there. Let me explain this.</i>

381
00:29:38,333 --> 00:29:41,040
<i>After I get her schedule,</i>

382
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:43,665
<i>which I would undoubtedly acquire</i>

383
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:47,040
<i>I will continue to follow her
to get more information.</i>

384
00:29:47,041 --> 00:29:48,082
<i>Follow her?</i>

385
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:49,208
<i>Follow her.</i>

386
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:52,666
<i>- Stalking?
- Correct!</i>

387
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,833
<i>Stalking.</i>

388
00:29:55,333 --> 00:29:58,707
<i>Even last time, I was a specialist.</i>

389
00:29:58,708 --> 00:29:59,958
{\an8}<i>In stalking.</i>

390
00:30:01,875 --> 00:30:02,790
{\an8}<i>Stalk all you want.</i>

391
00:30:02,791 --> 00:30:04,708
{\an8}<i>Okay. Regarding stalking.</i>

392
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,583
<i>There are more than
500 CCTVs at the Palace Hotel.</i>

393
00:30:10,166 --> 00:30:11,957
<i>Lan, hack into their server</i>

394
00:30:11,958 --> 00:30:13,375
<i>and give us full control.</i>

395
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:21,791
Okay. Pictures up.

396
00:30:26,666 --> 00:30:28,207
<i>Step five, transport.</i>

397
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:30,165
<i>In, out, one car.</i>

398
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:31,832
<i>Make sure the car can
handle our combined weight.</i>

399
00:30:31,833 --> 00:30:35,832
<i>Remember, this is a mafia event.
Not your usual hoodlums.</i>

400
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:37,832
<i>So, get a car that blends in.</i>

401
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:40,458
<i>Definitely need a turbo
and some custom suspensions.</i>

402
00:30:44,875 --> 00:30:46,041
I did good, right?

403
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:49,540
The exterior is cool, isn't it?

404
00:30:49,541 --> 00:30:51,749
Under the hood, there's a monster.

405
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:52,749
Diesel engine?

406
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,874
Yup.

407
00:30:53,875 --> 00:30:56,957
Come on. Diesel sounds terrible.

408
00:30:56,958 --> 00:30:59,416
Might as well drive a garbage truck.

409
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:01,540
Nice, right?

410
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:02,707
You're all talk.

411
00:31:02,708 --> 00:31:03,665
Where is the key?

412
00:31:03,666 --> 00:31:04,624
Why do you need it?

413
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:06,374
I want to test drive the car.

414
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:08,833
No way. You'll crash the car
before anything happens.

415
00:31:10,166 --> 00:31:11,625
Stingy.

416
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:15,333
When it's about me,
nothing is right. Everything is wrong.

417
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,208
It's just a car.

418
00:31:23,416 --> 00:31:24,415
<i>This is the most important</i>

419
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,124
<i>and the most challenging.</i>

420
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:28,665
<i>The time limit we have to crack this safe,</i>

421
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:30,207
<i>five minutes.</i>

422
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:33,166
<i>This is not our usual safe
with a single dial.</i>

423
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,124
<i>This has three.</i>

424
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:36,374
<i>Three?</i>

425
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:40,249
<i>A single dial is close
to a million combination.</i>

426
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:42,415
<i>Three dials would mean 30...</i>

427
00:31:42,416 --> 00:31:45,000
<i>It's impossible to crack in five minutes.</i>

428
00:31:45,666 --> 00:31:47,416
<i>There's only one solution.</i>

429
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:51,999
How is he doing?

430
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,249
Stubborn.

431
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,415
Can't get anything.

432
00:31:54,416 --> 00:31:55,791
Damn it.

433
00:31:57,291 --> 00:31:59,415
You're turning it too fast, Keyrol.

434
00:31:59,416 --> 00:32:00,625
Do it slowly.

435
00:32:05,416 --> 00:32:07,000
I think it's 70.

436
00:32:07,583 --> 00:32:08,666
There's no 70.

437
00:32:17,375 --> 00:32:18,583
Third wheel is six.

438
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:20,750
Okay. Good!

439
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:24,124
Forty-five.

440
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:25,124
Seventy.

441
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:26,291
Six.

442
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:29,583
Damn it!

443
00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:50,458
You're not consistent.

444
00:32:51,958 --> 00:32:56,875
That's why I told you to turn it slowly.

445
00:32:58,625 --> 00:33:02,583
Keyrol, in that vault
there are nine plates in a row.

446
00:33:03,458 --> 00:33:06,290
The further the plates,
the harder they are for you to feel.

447
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:09,083
That's why we're using the soundwaves.

448
00:33:11,291 --> 00:33:12,790
Angah. Reset it. Let's do it over.

449
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:13,916
Wait.

450
00:33:16,958 --> 00:33:19,125
When we get to the vault on that night,

451
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:21,833
I am your eyes.

452
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,250
And I am your ears.

453
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:28,000
If you want my help,

454
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,916
you need to let me help you.

455
00:33:42,958 --> 00:33:45,166
<i>You know the difference
between counterfeit and original?</i>

456
00:33:47,666 --> 00:33:49,332
If we buy original stuff,

457
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:50,625
only the rich become richer.

458
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:54,166
If you buy counterfeits,

459
00:33:57,083 --> 00:33:59,249
the laborers

460
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,499
the factory workers and even the sellers,

461
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,666
everyone gets the benefit.

462
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,082
So cool.

463
00:34:05,083 --> 00:34:06,208
Cool, right?

464
00:34:07,458 --> 00:34:08,291
Keep it.

465
00:34:10,166 --> 00:34:11,166
It's yours.

466
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:12,916
Are you for real, Dad?

467
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:15,457
Of course.

468
00:34:15,458 --> 00:34:17,457
I have another three at home.

469
00:34:17,458 --> 00:34:18,624
This one is for you.

470
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:20,375
The other three are for my girlfriends.

471
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:22,707
You told me it was two the other day.

472
00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:25,957
Now it's three. Show off.

473
00:34:25,958 --> 00:34:29,624
While I'm still able,
my knees aren't shaking,

474
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:31,624
we can marry four wives

475
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:34,333
- but have a lot of girlfriends.
- But have a lot of girlfriends.

476
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:43,208
It's okay. Go.

477
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,375
Go.

478
00:34:50,416 --> 00:34:51,375
Along.

479
00:34:57,125 --> 00:34:58,583
What are you looking for?

480
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:01,416
Looking for this?

481
00:35:01,958 --> 00:35:03,082
When did you lift it?

482
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:04,291
Here, take it.

483
00:35:05,791 --> 00:35:06,624
Dad.

484
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:07,833
No, I'm good.

485
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:13,250
Why did you come here?

486
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,500
- I...
- I'm asking why are you here?

487
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:17,874
I don't know who else to go to.

488
00:35:17,875 --> 00:35:19,458
I need your he...

489
00:35:20,958 --> 00:35:22,416
I told you before, right?

490
00:35:23,041 --> 00:35:24,291
Right?

491
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:27,874
I'm in danger. They're looking for me.

492
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,499
Of course they are!

493
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,875
Every day there's someone here
looking for you.

494
00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:36,165
Who haven't you pissed off out there?

495
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:37,749
I just want to borrow one gold bar.

496
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,707
Can you just think for a moment?

497
00:35:39,708 --> 00:35:42,290
People are sniffing it out.

498
00:35:42,291 --> 00:35:44,082
They're looking for it.

499
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:46,874
If anything happens,
who will take care of my siblings?

500
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:47,958
Who?

501
00:35:48,875 --> 00:35:50,000
You?

502
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:53,958
How could you do this to me?

503
00:35:55,916 --> 00:35:57,625
I brought you into this world.

504
00:35:58,416 --> 00:36:00,582
I taught you all your skills.

505
00:36:00,583 --> 00:36:01,790
All of you.

506
00:36:01,791 --> 00:36:02,999
I raised you all. This is how you repay...

507
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,707
What exactly have you taught us?

508
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:07,708
What kind of things did you teach us all?

509
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:12,125
Every time you screw up,
I have to deal with it.

510
00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:18,916
Don't you dare ask for anything
from us anymore, understand?

511
00:36:20,666 --> 00:36:22,625
So much for raising us.

512
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,708
I thought hiring a Master's degree holder...

513
00:37:21,333 --> 00:37:23,541
I don't even have a Michelin Star yet.

514
00:37:47,208 --> 00:37:50,291
I used Wagyu Oxtail.

515
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,875
Very delicious!

516
00:37:55,458 --> 00:38:00,875
Presenting Wagyu Oxtail Beef Bourguignon!

517
00:38:08,583 --> 00:38:09,750
I'll change it, I'll change it.

518
00:38:18,416 --> 00:38:22,125
I cooked that for 12 hours!

519
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,874
Before I destroy your future.

520
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:28,291
You get it? Jezz!

521
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,832
- Marco!
- Yes, Chef.

522
00:38:32,833 --> 00:38:34,749
- Yes?
- Marco! My eyes are wide open,

523
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:37,040
but I can't see anything.

524
00:38:37,041 --> 00:38:39,458
Chef, you're having a panic attack.

525
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,291
Marco!

526
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:49,083
I cooked for 12 hours!

527
00:38:52,916 --> 00:38:54,125
Did you see that?

528
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,083
Don't you see?

529
00:38:57,666 --> 00:38:58,750
My dish.

530
00:39:13,791 --> 00:39:15,125
‎Whatever...

531
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:18,625
Where did the cup go?

532
00:39:25,333 --> 00:39:26,666
There you are.

533
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:37,999
The 12-hour artwork
is actually quite delicious.

534
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,125
Let me try.

535
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:43,415
Oh, it's so good.

536
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:44,708
His art is very deep, right?

537
00:39:53,916 --> 00:39:55,416
Okay. Look for 53.

538
00:39:57,208 --> 00:39:58,375
Fifty-three is confirmed.

539
00:40:02,125 --> 00:40:03,625
- Eighty-seven?
- Nope.

540
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:05,666
No?

541
00:40:08,416 --> 00:40:10,083
Nope. Not 87.

542
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:19,750
Ninety-eight!

543
00:40:20,791 --> 00:40:23,083
14, 53, 98. Try it!

544
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:46,458
Four minutes and 58 seconds.

545
00:40:48,916 --> 00:40:50,500
Good job, Keyrol!

546
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:53,583
I told you he could open it.

547
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:00,457
Peekaboo!

548
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,249
I'm such a genius
at finding people, ain't it?

549
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:04,500
Who is that, Along?

550
00:41:05,291 --> 00:41:06,207
Didn't I tell you,

551
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:09,000
they're the best of the best.

552
00:41:09,666 --> 00:41:11,083
What do you want now?

553
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:14,624
Relax, big brother.

554
00:41:14,625 --> 00:41:17,000
Can't I just come to cheerlead?

555
00:41:19,416 --> 00:41:20,665
Keyrol!

556
00:41:20,666 --> 00:41:23,291
Do you know you're a rare gem?

557
00:41:23,958 --> 00:41:25,457
There's a bright future ahead of you.

558
00:41:25,458 --> 00:41:29,332
Luckily, my swing
the other day didn't hit your hand.

559
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:32,040
Or else you'd be whining,

560
00:41:32,041 --> 00:41:33,540
"My pretty hand is ruined!"

561
00:41:33,541 --> 00:41:35,415
"My pretty hand is ruined."

562
00:41:35,416 --> 00:41:37,791
"I can't rotate the dial."

563
00:41:40,041 --> 00:41:40,958
Are you done?

564
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:42,540
If you're done,

565
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:44,000
we have a lot of other things to do.

566
00:41:45,125 --> 00:41:47,374
This is the problem.
Hanging out with the youngsters,

567
00:41:47,375 --> 00:41:50,500
but there's this old man here
flexing his muscles.

568
00:41:54,041 --> 00:41:55,749
But it's actually good.

569
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,665
So you can shape your little brother,

570
00:41:57,666 --> 00:42:00,208
who's always fighting back. Good!

571
00:42:01,125 --> 00:42:03,374
Okay. I've seen
your progress and I'm satisfied.

572
00:42:03,375 --> 00:42:05,415
I will take my leave.

573
00:42:05,416 --> 00:42:07,665
Because I want to give an update

574
00:42:07,666 --> 00:42:10,457
<i>to my client that you're all impressive,</i>

575
00:42:10,458 --> 00:42:12,625
<i>the best and most convincing.</i>

576
00:42:33,166 --> 00:42:34,207
Your mom asked?

577
00:42:34,208 --> 00:42:36,583
Then, what did you say, baby?

578
00:42:38,208 --> 00:42:39,082
Look.

579
00:42:39,083 --> 00:42:40,415
You reply to her like this.

580
00:42:40,416 --> 00:42:43,999
Tell her that I'm busy.

581
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,249
I'm very important in the office.

582
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:49,125
If I'm not there,
my boss can't do his job.

583
00:42:56,333 --> 00:42:57,749
No.

584
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:59,124
Am I worried?

585
00:42:59,125 --> 00:43:00,875
Of course I'm worried.

586
00:43:02,666 --> 00:43:03,875
Okay. Listen to me, baby.

587
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:06,083
There isn't that much work left.

588
00:43:06,958 --> 00:43:12,083
Once I'm done, I'll pick you up, okay?

589
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,250
Five.

590
00:43:25,041 --> 00:43:26,083
Hey, catch!

591
00:43:32,166 --> 00:43:33,833
What's wrong with you, Rol?

592
00:43:35,541 --> 00:43:36,916
Sulking alone.

593
00:43:38,041 --> 00:43:39,625
I got you all into this, right?

594
00:43:40,583 --> 00:43:41,791
I should know my place.

595
00:43:42,583 --> 00:43:44,208
Who said that?

596
00:43:45,291 --> 00:43:46,665
It was you...

597
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:48,416
You like to think of nonsense.

598
00:43:48,958 --> 00:43:50,165
What else should I think of?

599
00:43:50,166 --> 00:43:52,875
Swear to God. No one has said anything.

600
00:43:55,708 --> 00:43:56,958
From what I see

601
00:43:58,583 --> 00:44:00,333
we're more alive now.

602
00:44:15,833 --> 00:44:19,332
Keyrol. You've never changed one bit.

603
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:22,499
Always need me
to cheer you up. Such a baby!

604
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,874
Don't start your big sister act.

605
00:44:24,875 --> 00:44:26,249
You could have been the youngest.

606
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:27,999
Goes to prove how much I love you.

607
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:28,999
How so?

608
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,999
Because I came out
to face the world first.

609
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,040
I prepared the canal for you.

610
00:44:33,041 --> 00:44:34,624
Wow! Load of rubbish.

611
00:44:34,625 --> 00:44:35,915
That hurts, you idiot!

612
00:44:35,916 --> 00:44:36,958
Load...

613
00:44:42,708 --> 00:44:43,833
Emma...

614
00:44:45,541 --> 00:44:46,958
Amer needs your help.

615
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:52,375
Men.

616
00:44:52,916 --> 00:44:53,916
Annoying.

617
00:44:57,291 --> 00:44:58,666
So, how is it?

618
00:44:59,583 --> 00:45:00,833
Are you ready for tomorrow?

619
00:45:02,583 --> 00:45:03,582
Yes.

620
00:45:03,583 --> 00:45:05,290
All the tools are packed.

621
00:45:05,291 --> 00:45:06,458
I've double-checked.

622
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,458
I think it's okay.

623
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,416
That's not what I meant.

624
00:45:15,833 --> 00:45:16,958
Keyrol.

625
00:45:18,666 --> 00:45:19,999
I know it's been ten years...

626
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:20,915
Along...

627
00:45:20,916 --> 00:45:22,125
Ten years...

628
00:45:23,791 --> 00:45:24,707
of anger.

629
00:45:24,708 --> 00:45:25,958
Along, I'm not angry.

630
00:45:28,375 --> 00:45:29,416
I'm not angry.

631
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:37,791
The angry phase is long gone.

632
00:45:44,916 --> 00:45:48,250
But the bitterness
is still there. Isn't it?

633
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:58,500
If only half of what we do now

634
00:46:01,041 --> 00:46:03,250
combined with your brain,

635
00:46:07,625 --> 00:46:09,500
went to help Dad back then.

636
00:46:11,833 --> 00:46:13,124
Guess we wouldn't have ended up like this.

637
00:46:13,125 --> 00:46:15,833
Help? Help him with what?

638
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:18,875
<i>He asked me to steal something.</i>

639
00:46:39,583 --> 00:46:42,000
Okay. Confirm. That's the lorry.

640
00:46:52,333 --> 00:46:53,541
What is this, Dad?

641
00:46:55,875 --> 00:46:57,958
There are no bullets.
It's just to scare them.

642
00:46:58,541 --> 00:47:00,082
Where did you get this?

643
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:01,250
As usual, I stole it.

644
00:47:08,333 --> 00:47:09,416
Okay. Now.

645
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,416
Don't move.

646
00:47:29,083 --> 00:47:30,790
You got a death wish?

647
00:47:30,791 --> 00:47:31,832
Hand. Your hands.

648
00:47:31,833 --> 00:47:33,874
You're messing with
the wrong people, old man!

649
00:47:33,875 --> 00:47:35,499
Hey! You think I'm playing?

650
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,833
I will shoot your brains out.

651
00:48:02,875 --> 00:48:04,665
Dad, let him go.

652
00:48:04,666 --> 00:48:06,290
- It's not the stuff we're looking for.
- Then what is it?

653
00:48:06,291 --> 00:48:08,083
Those are not computer parts.

654
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:11,749
Dad!

655
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:12,832
Keyrol.

656
00:48:12,833 --> 00:48:14,499
<i>Dad, come here!</i>

657
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:17,500
You know, right? You know why I didn't...

658
00:48:19,208 --> 00:48:20,166
Never mind.

659
00:48:20,958 --> 00:48:22,541
And this is what you want now?

660
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:27,458
You want us to be like
the old days. Working together.

661
00:48:28,916 --> 00:48:30,458
Even if is just for one day.

662
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,791
A day like we once were.

663
00:48:40,541 --> 00:48:42,083
And we'll part ways after this.

664
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:46,250
I'm going to bed.

665
00:48:53,208 --> 00:48:55,500
Wow! Your suit's tight like your face.

666
00:48:56,791 --> 00:48:58,082
Chill, dude.

667
00:48:58,083 --> 00:49:00,333
This isn't your first time.
Just been a long time.

668
00:49:03,791 --> 00:49:06,875
So, how is your favorite brother?

669
00:49:10,708 --> 00:49:11,874
Okay, you don't have to tell me.

670
00:49:11,875 --> 00:49:13,458
I can tell from your face.

671
00:49:15,583 --> 00:49:17,041
Hey, you...

672
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:22,874
If you want someone gone,

673
00:49:22,875 --> 00:49:24,166
I can help.

674
00:49:24,916 --> 00:49:27,125
I can look for anything you want.

675
00:49:28,208 --> 00:49:30,707
But the issue with your brother,

676
00:49:30,708 --> 00:49:32,291
even I can't help.

677
00:49:33,166 --> 00:49:35,625
Puts Hong Kong drama to shame.

678
00:49:39,208 --> 00:49:40,333
Looks alright.

679
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:46,458
Let's go eat pig.

680
00:49:47,875 --> 00:49:48,915
You're the pig.

681
00:49:48,916 --> 00:49:50,666
I meant barbecue.

682
00:50:23,041 --> 00:50:24,333
The Crown Prince is moving.

683
00:50:27,375 --> 00:50:28,790
The crown has arrived.

684
00:50:28,791 --> 00:50:31,124
Alright, guys. Get into position.

685
00:50:31,125 --> 00:50:32,791
The party is on.

686
00:51:13,958 --> 00:51:14,875
We got eyes.

687
00:51:20,875 --> 00:51:25,374
<i>My lonely night</i>

688
00:51:25,375 --> 00:51:28,540
<i>Only you</i>

689
00:51:28,541 --> 00:51:33,958
<i>In my heart</i>

690
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:43,415
<i>Don't look at me, dear</i>

691
00:51:43,416 --> 00:51:47,290
<i>I'll fall to your arms</i>

692
00:51:47,291 --> 00:51:51,165
<i>If you like it</i>

693
00:51:51,166 --> 00:51:54,708
<i>Don't just move it</i>

694
00:51:56,083 --> 00:51:58,000
Three syllables only.

695
00:51:59,083 --> 00:52:01,458
Sa-ri-ban!

696
00:52:02,041 --> 00:52:04,124
Sariban?

697
00:52:04,125 --> 00:52:06,415
Is this your real name?

698
00:52:06,416 --> 00:52:08,875
Or are you just lying to us?

699
00:52:09,541 --> 00:52:14,125
How can I ever lie
to cute girls like you both.

700
00:52:17,333 --> 00:52:18,166
Angah, two o'clock.

701
00:52:36,791 --> 00:52:38,540
Okay, Keyrol and Emma.

702
00:52:38,541 --> 00:52:40,000
Anytime when you're ready.

703
00:53:20,375 --> 00:53:21,500
Emma, I'm in position.

704
00:53:28,083 --> 00:53:29,624
You're a piece of trash.

705
00:53:29,625 --> 00:53:31,249
How long do you want me to wait?

706
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:33,207
Six months is not enough?

707
00:53:33,208 --> 00:53:34,416
Looping footage.

708
00:53:39,125 --> 00:53:40,333
Six month and you say that's not long?

709
00:53:43,958 --> 00:53:45,790
The sentence, "I'm divorcing you"

710
00:53:45,791 --> 00:53:47,416
wouldn't even take six seconds to say.

711
00:53:50,291 --> 00:53:51,749
You want to talk about this handbag?

712
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:53,708
{\an8}You think I care about it?

713
00:53:54,291 --> 00:53:55,458
I dare you, say it one more time.

714
00:53:56,916 --> 00:53:57,916
Say it again!

715
00:54:04,208 --> 00:54:05,207
Now. Go.

716
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:06,540
Hey, what do you think I am?

717
00:54:06,541 --> 00:54:09,374
Your part-time job? Your weekend conquest?

718
00:54:09,375 --> 00:54:11,332
No, you don't get to waste my time.

719
00:54:11,333 --> 00:54:12,874
The thing is

720
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:14,624
since you love
your old hag of a wife so much,

721
00:54:14,625 --> 00:54:17,541
both of you can go to hell!

722
00:54:23,458 --> 00:54:24,666
This is a restricted area.

723
00:54:40,708 --> 00:54:43,249
What's your problem? Can't you see?

724
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:45,125
I'm having a meltdown here.

725
00:54:45,791 --> 00:54:47,291
Ma'am, take this.

726
00:54:48,125 --> 00:54:49,374
My man is leaving me.

727
00:54:49,375 --> 00:54:51,290
And now you want to kick me out?

728
00:54:51,291 --> 00:54:52,583
Now. That's enough!

729
00:55:00,541 --> 00:55:02,458
You are quite rough.

730
00:55:05,791 --> 00:55:06,916
But it's alright.

731
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:09,625
I like...

732
00:55:10,791 --> 00:55:14,916
a man who gets rough with me.

733
00:55:18,541 --> 00:55:19,832
I need to report this.

734
00:55:19,833 --> 00:55:20,750
‎Hey!

735
00:55:25,666 --> 00:55:28,666
Wouldn't you want to
get rough with me as well?

736
00:55:35,708 --> 00:55:37,750
Two rough men.

737
00:55:41,666 --> 00:55:43,291
it will be wild tonight.

738
00:56:05,625 --> 00:56:07,583
You said something
about restricted area, right?

739
00:56:22,083 --> 00:56:22,916
Evil.

740
00:58:21,333 --> 00:58:22,915
What's wrong with this thing?

741
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,208
<i>What's wrong?</i>

742
00:58:28,208 --> 00:58:29,500
I think the cable is knotted.

743
00:58:30,583 --> 00:58:33,208
Is just a bit. Wait, let me try.

744
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:40,582
Settled.

745
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:42,416
Be careful, Keyrol.

746
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,041
Damn it.

747
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,541
<i>What's happening?</i>

748
00:59:07,125 --> 00:59:08,000
Are you okay?

749
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:09,875
I'm okay.

750
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:11,833
I'm okay.

751
00:59:36,291 --> 00:59:37,500
{\an8}Oh God!

752
00:59:40,916 --> 00:59:42,083
Oh God!

753
00:59:44,625 --> 00:59:45,666
Vault Unit, come in.

754
00:59:50,208 --> 00:59:51,624
<i>What's going on down there?</i>

755
00:59:51,625 --> 00:59:52,750
Hang on. I'm checking.

756
01:00:01,875 --> 01:00:04,833
Give me a minute. Once the alarm
is triggered, all cameras are on reset.

757
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,249
It's weird.

758
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:15,791
There's nothing here.

759
01:00:17,125 --> 01:00:18,458
Might be a glitch in the system.

760
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,166
Okay. It's done.

761
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:30,458
Keyrol.

762
01:00:37,125 --> 01:00:38,125
Keyrol?

763
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:42,375
<i>I'm okay.</i>

764
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:45,415
Don't keep us hanging like that.

765
01:00:45,416 --> 01:00:47,332
Hey, one at a time, alright.

766
01:00:47,333 --> 01:00:49,540
I need to handle
the elevator and the guard.

767
01:00:49,541 --> 01:00:50,833
Give me a break.

768
01:01:26,958 --> 01:01:29,416
Angah, the fingerprint won't go through.

769
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:31,541
Oh, my.

770
01:01:32,708 --> 01:01:34,708
Try uploading it again.

771
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:46,915
<i>Guys, it won't budge.</i>

772
01:01:46,916 --> 01:01:48,790
How can this happen?

773
01:01:48,791 --> 01:01:52,290
<i>You. Angah. Did you check
the thumb print properly?</i>

774
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:56,040
I did. I scanned the cup
that Amer gave me five times.

775
01:01:56,041 --> 01:01:57,249
That's true.

776
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:59,625
That's the cup I took from Miranda's hand.

777
01:02:00,208 --> 01:02:03,332
Are you sure there were no other cups?

778
01:02:03,333 --> 01:02:04,875
What other cups could there be, Along?

779
01:02:12,708 --> 01:02:13,666
Amer.

780
01:02:14,416 --> 01:02:15,625
I think we may have taken...

781
01:02:22,625 --> 01:02:24,833
her assistant's cup.

782
01:02:26,333 --> 01:02:27,708
Oh no!

783
01:02:28,875 --> 01:02:31,125
Damn it!

784
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,957
You guys are idiots.

785
01:02:35,958 --> 01:02:38,749
I'm already down here, damn it.

786
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:41,374
When you were young,
you refused to get educated.

787
01:02:41,375 --> 01:02:44,166
Now, you're dumb and a burden to us all.

788
01:02:59,916 --> 01:03:00,957
Lan.

789
01:03:00,958 --> 01:03:03,790
Show me all cameras at that party.

790
01:03:03,791 --> 01:03:04,790
What for?

791
01:03:04,791 --> 01:03:05,916
Just do it.

792
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:08,582
<i>Sorry, Along.</i>

793
01:03:08,583 --> 01:03:10,540
<i>I know I messed up but I...</i>

794
01:03:10,541 --> 01:03:11,874
<i>- Yeah, you messed it up!
- Yeah, you messed it up!</i>

795
01:03:11,875 --> 01:03:12,957
<i>It's a simple thing.</i>

796
01:03:12,958 --> 01:03:14,582
Camera 32. Enlarge that.

797
01:03:14,583 --> 01:03:17,040
<i>It's just a fingerprint.
How's that even difficult?</i>

798
01:03:17,041 --> 01:03:18,707
<i>Along, we can't rely on Amer.</i>

799
01:03:18,708 --> 01:03:20,124
<i>Why don't you try and get her fingerprint?</i>

800
01:03:20,125 --> 01:03:22,457
<i>You're at the wrong
and you won't even admit to it.</i>

801
01:03:22,458 --> 01:03:24,874
<i>You! Why did you go
and push the assistant's cup?</i>

802
01:03:24,875 --> 01:03:25,874
Found you.

803
01:03:25,875 --> 01:03:28,125
<i>How is it my fault now? You're such a...</i>

804
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:30,541
Amer, Emma.

805
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,791
Listen carefully.

806
01:03:37,083 --> 01:03:39,249
I've never watched a heist film

807
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:40,791
where getting the fingerprint failed.

808
01:03:41,833 --> 01:03:43,875
It should be the easiest thing.

809
01:03:44,791 --> 01:03:47,333
You must think that we're
a group of stupid robbers, right?

810
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:42,749
Now, I present to you the iron lady,

811
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:45,540
also the heart of this party tonight.

812
01:04:45,541 --> 01:04:48,457
She will perform a special dance
dedicated to her brother.

813
01:04:48,458 --> 01:04:49,958
The stage is yours.

814
01:05:12,666 --> 01:05:14,708
I am a much truer man.

815
01:06:56,333 --> 01:06:57,541
Korti.

816
01:06:58,458 --> 01:07:01,291
Sariban Korti.

817
01:07:09,791 --> 01:07:10,665
Hey.

818
01:07:10,666 --> 01:07:11,708
Where is it?

819
01:07:14,583 --> 01:07:16,416
Yes. Take this.

820
01:07:19,208 --> 01:07:20,415
How is it?

821
01:07:20,416 --> 01:07:21,957
- What?
- How many stars do I get?

822
01:07:21,958 --> 01:07:24,957
Oh my. Okay. I'll give you five stars.

823
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:26,750
That's just because you were dancing.

824
01:07:27,833 --> 01:07:29,208
Piss off.

825
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,499
- Here.
- Okay? You got it?

826
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:38,416
Okay. Nice.

827
01:07:58,375 --> 01:07:59,500
Finally, it went through.

828
01:08:22,125 --> 01:08:24,583
<i>Along, the speech has started.</i>

829
01:08:26,833 --> 01:08:30,374
Okay. After the speech
they are going to fetch the ring.

830
01:08:30,375 --> 01:08:36,957
{\an8}I can't believe in this life
of mine, I still get the chance

831
01:08:36,958 --> 01:08:41,082
at an event like this to give a speech

832
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:45,207
for the appointment of our new leader.

833
01:08:45,208 --> 01:08:46,874
<i>Keyrol, five minutes...</i>

834
01:08:46,875 --> 01:08:48,041
<i>starts now.</i>

835
01:09:01,583 --> 01:09:02,540
Twenty-one?

836
01:09:02,541 --> 01:09:04,375
Twenty-one, confirmed.

837
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:14,750
Keyrol, the first dial is 21, 76, 3.

838
01:09:24,375 --> 01:09:27,499
This time around,

839
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,208
I'm going to keep this short.

840
01:09:29,833 --> 01:09:32,583
I just want to remind everyone

841
01:09:33,208 --> 01:09:36,749
of a thing that I once said.

842
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:38,165
A quarter of the speech is done.

843
01:09:38,166 --> 01:09:42,583
The second dial, 31, 15, 91.

844
01:09:55,125 --> 01:09:56,291
Nice.

845
01:10:08,166 --> 01:10:09,291
Along.

846
01:10:09,958 --> 01:10:10,915
How are we doing for time?

847
01:10:10,916 --> 01:10:12,625
Don't worry, Keyrol.

848
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:15,249
<i>Stay focused and maintain your pace.</i>

849
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:16,875
<i>This is the most difficult dial.</i>

850
01:10:18,791 --> 01:10:20,499
The responsibility of a leader...

851
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:22,625
Guys, it's half the speech.

852
01:10:23,208 --> 01:10:25,416
It'd be great if we had more time.

853
01:10:32,583 --> 01:10:35,832
Rol. That's too fast.

854
01:10:35,833 --> 01:10:37,125
You need to do it slowly.

855
01:10:45,166 --> 01:10:48,000
In any decision,

856
01:10:49,333 --> 01:10:52,541
there will be people who celebrate it.

857
01:10:53,125 --> 01:10:56,541
And there will always be haters.

858
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:04,000
I think it's 25.

859
01:11:04,583 --> 01:11:06,082
There's no 25.

860
01:11:06,083 --> 01:11:07,416
Negative.

861
01:11:12,916 --> 01:11:17,582
And when the decision is made

862
01:11:17,583 --> 01:11:20,291
that causes hatred,

863
01:11:20,791 --> 01:11:21,624
even though...

864
01:11:21,625 --> 01:11:23,625
Along, the woman is gone.

865
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:26,832
She's gone?

866
01:11:26,833 --> 01:11:27,999
I swear.

867
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,833
My eyes were on her.

868
01:11:30,333 --> 01:11:33,582
<i>I turned away for a moment and she's gone.</i>

869
01:11:33,583 --> 01:11:36,125
<i>And you claim to be
a specialist in stalking.</i>

870
01:11:36,708 --> 01:11:38,165
<i>The one person you're stalking is gone!</i>

871
01:11:38,166 --> 01:11:39,333
<i>Shut up!</i>

872
01:11:46,666 --> 01:11:48,875
Along. What do we do now?

873
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,125
One.

874
01:11:52,666 --> 01:11:54,165
Two.

875
01:11:54,166 --> 01:11:55,333
Three.

876
01:11:56,125 --> 01:11:57,582
We won't even have three minutes.

877
01:11:57,583 --> 01:11:59,041
<i>It's impossible, Along.</i>

878
01:11:59,708 --> 01:12:01,083
<i>Are we going to abort?</i>

879
01:12:03,791 --> 01:12:04,750
<i>Keyrol.</i>

880
01:12:05,416 --> 01:12:07,750
<i>If we leave here empty-handed,</i>

881
01:12:08,375 --> 01:12:10,208
<i>the repercussions are much more severe.</i>

882
01:12:10,833 --> 01:12:12,415
Are you for real?

883
01:12:12,416 --> 01:12:14,500
<i>I believe you, Keyrol.</i>

884
01:12:15,916 --> 01:12:17,458
Forget about the stethoscope.

885
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:22,750
Whatever happens, I'll be by your side

886
01:12:23,708 --> 01:12:25,750
until the end.

887
01:16:29,333 --> 01:16:31,458
Okay. We're not done yet.

888
01:16:32,041 --> 01:16:33,290
We need to move now.

889
01:16:33,291 --> 01:16:34,541
Meet at the loading bay.

890
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,750
I would like to
express my sincere appreciation

891
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:45,790
to every family member of Five Ivory

892
01:16:45,791 --> 01:16:46,833
who attended this event tonight.

893
01:16:47,875 --> 01:16:52,499
Your presence is an honor for me.

894
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:53,458
Thank you.

895
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:03,374
Without further ado,

896
01:17:03,375 --> 01:17:06,749
we're officiating the appointment

897
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:09,833
of the newly crowned owner of Five Ivory.

898
01:17:41,375 --> 01:17:45,290
Ladies and gentlemen, let's take a break.

899
01:17:45,291 --> 01:17:47,415
In the meantime, let's enjoy the night

900
01:17:47,416 --> 01:17:50,333
with some songs. Music please.

901
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,124
We have a situation.

902
01:18:02,125 --> 01:18:03,333
Seal the building now.

903
01:18:07,625 --> 01:18:09,958
Guys, we must hurry. They're coming fast.

904
01:18:25,833 --> 01:18:26,999
Hey, Amer.

905
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,333
Along, the plan is a no-go.
They're closing the back door.

906
01:18:30,166 --> 01:18:31,000
<i>We'll meet in the basement.</i>

907
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:34,915
For real? We're already outside.

908
01:18:34,916 --> 01:18:36,500
What is your problem?

909
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,374
Why is it so difficult

910
01:18:44,375 --> 01:18:47,416
to give me what's rightfully mine?

911
01:18:49,375 --> 01:18:51,125
Bashir, calm down.

912
01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:53,000
We'll find it.

913
01:18:55,791 --> 01:18:57,083
I will find it.

914
01:18:59,958 --> 01:19:00,916
Get the lift.

915
01:19:09,625 --> 01:19:11,416
Sir! Excuse me, sir.

916
01:19:14,375 --> 01:19:15,707
You go down first.

917
01:19:15,708 --> 01:19:17,249
- What about you?
- Just go.

918
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:18,165
Along.

919
01:19:18,166 --> 01:19:19,249
Sir?

920
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:21,790
Yes, sir. Is there a problem?

921
01:19:21,791 --> 01:19:24,166
There's no problem but there's been a...

922
01:19:57,833 --> 01:19:58,750
Camera eight.

923
01:20:08,041 --> 01:20:10,583
<i>No one gets in and out
of the hotel until he's found.</i>

924
01:20:21,416 --> 01:20:22,458
That's him!

925
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:39,083
‎Hey!

926
01:21:03,625 --> 01:21:06,249
Ma'am, we found
the suspect at Restaurant Celestial.

927
01:21:06,250 --> 01:21:08,708
I repeat, we've found the suspect.

928
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,125
Emma.

929
01:21:18,166 --> 01:21:21,000
If I knew this would happen...

930
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,832
You made this happened too.

931
01:21:24,833 --> 01:21:26,082
Sir.

932
01:21:26,083 --> 01:21:27,375
Please cooperate.

933
01:21:34,625 --> 01:21:35,750
Angah.

934
01:21:46,250 --> 01:21:48,499
Why is he waving at us?

935
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:50,750
And why are you waving back at him?

936
01:21:58,250 --> 01:21:59,625
We'll take him now.

937
01:22:18,208 --> 01:22:20,208
He can actually run.

938
01:22:26,875 --> 01:22:28,333
Go!

939
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:51,583
{\an8}‎Hurry!

940
01:24:06,416 --> 01:24:07,915
Angah, jump!

941
01:24:07,916 --> 01:24:08,957
Jump?

942
01:24:08,958 --> 01:24:10,791
- To the front!
- Front?

943
01:24:11,291 --> 01:24:12,333
Now!

944
01:24:36,166 --> 01:24:38,665
What kind of stupid plan is this,
damn it?!

945
01:24:38,666 --> 01:24:40,208
How is it our fault when you can't fit?

946
01:24:43,041 --> 01:24:44,083
Long!

947
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,332
Pull me in.

948
01:24:50,333 --> 01:24:51,291
This is one hell of a pull.

949
01:25:06,833 --> 01:25:08,207
Not yet.

950
01:25:08,208 --> 01:25:09,291
We need to find a way out.

951
01:25:10,875 --> 01:25:12,125
Keys.

952
01:25:17,041 --> 01:25:19,124
<i>Along. We've got Angah.</i>

953
01:25:19,125 --> 01:25:20,458
You go ahead.

954
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,249
<i>What about you guys? We can't just leave...</i>

955
01:25:23,250 --> 01:25:24,750
Emma, go now.

956
01:25:26,250 --> 01:25:27,375
Damn it!

957
01:25:41,083 --> 01:25:42,208
Along.

958
01:25:49,416 --> 01:25:50,707
Hey!

959
01:25:50,708 --> 01:25:51,625
‎Oh, my God!

960
01:25:55,375 --> 01:25:57,374
Hey, you're crazy, Emma!

961
01:25:57,375 --> 01:25:59,375
We left Along and Keyrol behind.

962
01:26:00,083 --> 01:26:01,791
That's crazier.

963
01:26:10,750 --> 01:26:11,707
The key, Keyrol. Key!

964
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:12,791
Let me do it.

965
01:26:16,041 --> 01:26:17,208
Hurry up, Keyrol.

966
01:26:17,875 --> 01:26:18,875
Hurry up.

967
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,208
Okay.

968
01:26:26,291 --> 01:26:27,666
What is this, Keyrol?

969
01:26:29,166 --> 01:26:30,708
What are you doing, Keyrol?

970
01:26:37,166 --> 01:26:40,374
I think you have your way.

971
01:26:40,375 --> 01:26:41,500
I have my own way.

972
01:26:42,416 --> 01:26:45,082
No. Don't do this. Don't do this.

973
01:26:45,083 --> 01:26:48,166
Do you know what will happen
if you work alone?

974
01:26:49,416 --> 01:26:50,833
Have you forgotten about it?

975
01:26:52,291 --> 01:26:54,041
You want to repeat your mistake
from back then?

976
01:26:54,625 --> 01:26:57,541
Even in this situation
you still don't get it?

977
01:27:01,375 --> 01:27:03,250
You think the ten years I was in there,

978
01:27:04,333 --> 01:27:05,875
it was my mistake?

979
01:27:07,833 --> 01:27:09,166
Here, Dad! Here!

980
01:27:13,541 --> 01:27:14,583
Come here!

981
01:27:18,291 --> 01:27:19,291
Look!

982
01:27:21,666 --> 01:27:22,708
Dad!

983
01:27:23,250 --> 01:27:24,708
Here, Dad!

984
01:27:26,166 --> 01:27:27,333
Police!

985
01:27:27,916 --> 01:27:28,875
Dad!

986
01:27:31,416 --> 01:27:32,291
Dad!

987
01:27:43,291 --> 01:27:44,791
Let's go.

988
01:27:45,875 --> 01:27:46,875
Let's go, Dad!

989
01:27:49,541 --> 01:27:52,541
- Here.
- I can't, Keyrol.

990
01:27:53,541 --> 01:27:54,790
I can't.

991
01:27:54,791 --> 01:27:57,915
- Dad, we need to get up.
- Where are they? Move!

992
01:27:57,916 --> 01:27:58,999
We need to run. Come on.

993
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,125
- Come on.
- Check over there.

994
01:28:03,458 --> 01:28:05,250
Up the hill, let's go.

995
01:28:07,083 --> 01:28:09,499
Listen to me, Keyrol.

996
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:10,750
Listen.

997
01:28:15,041 --> 01:28:16,000
I hope

998
01:28:18,291 --> 01:28:21,250
this is enough as an atonement

999
01:28:22,583 --> 01:28:23,666
for all my mistakes.

1000
01:28:37,083 --> 01:28:38,291
Hey!

1001
01:28:40,083 --> 01:28:42,915
You're looking for me,
right? I'm right here!

1002
01:28:42,916 --> 01:28:44,208
Over there!

1003
01:28:45,125 --> 01:28:46,875
Put your gun away! I said put it away!

1004
01:28:47,833 --> 01:28:49,999
<i>I've been thinking for ten years.</i>

1005
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,041
<i>The conclusion is clear.</i>

1006
01:28:52,958 --> 01:28:58,124
<i>Dad is dead
because you chose not to help him.</i>

1007
01:28:58,125 --> 01:28:59,916
- Calm down.
- Gun!

1008
01:29:02,916 --> 01:29:05,875
<i>That night, he didn't
choose to save himself.</i>

1009
01:29:06,708 --> 01:29:11,125
<i>He chose to save me.</i>

1010
01:29:15,208 --> 01:29:16,583
What did you say, Along?

1011
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:19,250
Don't repeat my past mistake?

1012
01:29:20,583 --> 01:29:23,250
That is exactly what I'm doing right now.

1013
01:29:25,250 --> 01:29:28,207
I don't want to live
with you making the call

1014
01:29:28,208 --> 01:29:31,750
where you get to
choose who lives and dies.

1015
01:29:33,375 --> 01:29:35,082
There are things that you think you know

1016
01:29:35,083 --> 01:29:37,458
but you actually don't understand.

1017
01:29:38,125 --> 01:29:39,291
You don't understand.

1018
01:29:41,333 --> 01:29:43,832
The moment you give them
the ring, you will die!

1019
01:29:43,833 --> 01:29:48,958
At least, this is my decision.

1020
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:55,750
You take care of yourself, Along.

1021
01:29:58,750 --> 01:30:01,624
Keyrol. Rol!

1022
01:30:01,625 --> 01:30:02,833
Keyrol!

1023
01:30:43,083 --> 01:30:47,500
I thought you were
only good at cracking safes.

1024
01:30:49,375 --> 01:30:52,333
You're also good at
betraying your brother.

1025
01:30:59,666 --> 01:31:00,583
What's wrong?

1026
01:31:01,541 --> 01:31:04,416
Afraid of the dark?

1027
01:31:21,416 --> 01:31:23,749
Why didn't he pick up the phone?

1028
01:31:23,750 --> 01:31:26,832
Guys. I don't think
we should stay here anymore.

1029
01:31:26,833 --> 01:31:29,041
We need to split up and run.

1030
01:31:29,583 --> 01:31:30,707
And?

1031
01:31:30,708 --> 01:31:33,040
Disappear one after another?
Are you crazy?

1032
01:31:33,041 --> 01:31:34,999
Don't try to be a smarty-pants.

1033
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,624
You dare to be responsible of our lives?

1034
01:31:36,625 --> 01:31:38,332
You are such a jerk. When you messed up,

1035
01:31:38,333 --> 01:31:40,040
did anyone hold you accountable
for our lives?

1036
01:31:40,041 --> 01:31:41,874
What has this got to do with me?

1037
01:31:41,875 --> 01:31:44,208
Can you guys please...

1038
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:47,249
- Along.
- Along.

1039
01:31:47,250 --> 01:31:48,375
Along.

1040
01:31:51,250 --> 01:31:53,041
Where's Keyrol?

1041
01:31:55,916 --> 01:31:56,875
Along.

1042
01:31:58,375 --> 01:31:59,375
Where's Keyrol, Along?

1043
01:32:00,041 --> 01:32:01,083
Keyrol is gone.

1044
01:32:02,583 --> 01:32:03,875
Keyrol is with them.

1045
01:32:04,458 --> 01:32:06,333
So, does that mean we're good?

1046
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,166
No.

1047
01:32:10,125 --> 01:32:12,666
We should've done this job quietly.

1048
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:17,125
Now, all of Five Ivory knows it's us.

1049
01:32:25,958 --> 01:32:31,541
Birds that are caged too long
will become spoiled.

1050
01:32:34,666 --> 01:32:35,708
You?

1051
01:32:36,583 --> 01:32:38,375
It needs to be fed.

1052
01:32:43,791 --> 01:32:45,000
I never imagined this.

1053
01:32:46,833 --> 01:32:48,375
Imagined what?

1054
01:32:51,666 --> 01:32:53,291
That I like birds?

1055
01:32:54,458 --> 01:32:59,375
Or, you feel like you're the bird?

1056
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:01,875
Where are my gold bars?

1057
01:33:05,875 --> 01:33:07,375
Patience, kid.

1058
01:33:08,333 --> 01:33:11,958
I'm actually rather confused.

1059
01:33:12,708 --> 01:33:19,207
You're bored being
under your brother's wing. I get that.

1060
01:33:19,208 --> 01:33:20,458
Just like me.

1061
01:33:20,958 --> 01:33:25,208
I did all this
because I want to save my family,

1062
01:33:25,833 --> 01:33:27,375
Five Ivory.

1063
01:33:31,208 --> 01:33:32,666
But you...

1064
01:33:33,916 --> 01:33:35,125
What is it about?

1065
01:33:36,083 --> 01:33:38,166
You double-crossed your own brother.

1066
01:33:40,666 --> 01:33:42,625
Don't tell me you're just being...

1067
01:33:43,708 --> 01:33:45,375
rebellious?

1068
01:33:57,708 --> 01:33:59,000
I knew it.

1069
01:33:59,916 --> 01:34:02,250
You're just like these birds.

1070
01:34:02,833 --> 01:34:06,999
When kept in a cage
they desperately want to be free.

1071
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:10,541
But once they're free,
they live like they are in the cage.

1072
01:34:11,208 --> 01:34:12,791
Hey, Grandpa!

1073
01:34:20,583 --> 01:34:23,125
Only I know where the ring is.

1074
01:34:34,708 --> 01:34:37,083
Are you sure
you want to play it like this?

1075
01:34:40,708 --> 01:34:41,958
What now?

1076
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:45,958
You want to threaten me?

1077
01:34:48,625 --> 01:34:50,041
Or kill me?

1078
01:34:52,291 --> 01:34:53,625
Kill you?

1079
01:34:54,916 --> 01:34:56,625
Keyrol...

1080
01:35:01,791 --> 01:35:04,291
The ring is of no importance now.

1081
01:35:09,458 --> 01:35:11,458
Your face right now

1082
01:35:13,250 --> 01:35:16,041
looks just like your dad's,

1083
01:35:19,416 --> 01:35:20,416
Johar.

1084
01:35:21,666 --> 01:35:23,332
<i>Give me some more time.</i>

1085
01:35:23,333 --> 01:35:25,582
I'll get you the gold bars.

1086
01:35:25,583 --> 01:35:27,041
Just a little more time.

1087
01:35:32,875 --> 01:35:35,208
Or you can run an errand for me.

1088
01:35:37,541 --> 01:35:39,000
Steal something.

1089
01:35:50,875 --> 01:35:52,791
To ease your job.

1090
01:36:08,666 --> 01:36:10,124
Get lost.

1091
01:36:10,125 --> 01:36:11,416
Never mind then.

1092
01:36:25,916 --> 01:36:26,916
Thanks, bro.

1093
01:36:31,708 --> 01:36:33,374
Dad, we need to go.

1094
01:36:33,375 --> 01:36:34,624
It's not the stuff we're looking for.

1095
01:36:34,625 --> 01:36:35,708
Then what is it?

1096
01:36:36,541 --> 01:36:38,333
Those are not computer parts.

1097
01:36:42,250 --> 01:36:43,333
Dad! Here, Dad!

1098
01:36:44,333 --> 01:36:46,000
How dare you steal my stuff?!

1099
01:36:50,666 --> 01:36:52,833
<i>Emergency call 999.</i>

1100
01:37:05,291 --> 01:37:07,290
Police! Freeze!

1101
01:37:07,291 --> 01:37:10,750
<i>That should have been the end for Bashir.</i>

1102
01:37:12,791 --> 01:37:14,416
<i>But my brother</i>

1103
01:37:15,833 --> 01:37:18,540
was willing to go through hell as long as

1104
01:37:18,541 --> 01:37:21,875
that devil of his was saved.

1105
01:37:23,583 --> 01:37:26,541
Your father was a waste of bait.

1106
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:28,625
Shut up!

1107
01:37:46,416 --> 01:37:48,375
You son of a gun!

1108
01:37:53,666 --> 01:37:55,624
Life is funny, isn't it?

1109
01:37:55,625 --> 01:37:59,499
Ten years ago,
your father came easily to me.

1110
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:01,041
Now, it's you.

1111
01:38:04,458 --> 01:38:08,916
A rather sad coincidence.

1112
01:38:16,666 --> 01:38:18,625
But maybe that's how life goes, right?

1113
01:38:21,916 --> 01:38:24,291
No matter how hard we fight

1114
01:38:25,250 --> 01:38:28,541
not everything is in our hands.

1115
01:38:30,125 --> 01:38:31,208
Damn you!

1116
01:38:31,708 --> 01:38:33,000
Damn you!

1117
01:38:42,375 --> 01:38:43,915
It breaks my heart...

1118
01:38:43,916 --> 01:38:45,875
to kill talented people.

1119
01:38:49,708 --> 01:38:50,541
Let's go.

1120
01:39:01,875 --> 01:39:03,583
Patience.

1121
01:39:05,791 --> 01:39:08,541
Your pain is only worldly.

1122
01:39:09,708 --> 01:39:11,291
It will soon be gone.

1123
01:39:14,916 --> 01:39:17,375
Along, what are we going to do now?

1124
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:30,290
We can't just be waiting here like this.

1125
01:39:30,291 --> 01:39:31,708
They will kill Keyrol, Along.

1126
01:39:36,916 --> 01:39:38,333
Wait!

1127
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,125
That's enough of a fight.

1128
01:41:43,708 --> 01:41:44,791
Bashir.

1129
01:41:49,541 --> 01:41:50,500
Take me away!

1130
01:42:04,500 --> 01:42:06,874
Hey, old man! Where are you running to?

1131
01:42:06,875 --> 01:42:08,041
Bastard!

1132
01:42:17,291 --> 01:42:19,041
Boss! Hurry up, boss!

1133
01:43:30,500 --> 01:43:32,083
First a traitor,

1134
01:43:33,375 --> 01:43:35,458
now you want to be a murderer?

1135
01:43:39,041 --> 01:43:40,041
Keyrol.

1136
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:45,666
What if we agree to a truce?

1137
01:43:47,208 --> 01:43:48,208
A truce?

1138
01:43:48,708 --> 01:43:50,540
Just say it.

1139
01:43:50,541 --> 01:43:52,541
What's your price? I'm willing to pay it.

1140
01:43:53,958 --> 01:43:55,165
I'll pay.

1141
01:43:55,166 --> 01:43:57,708
Even if it's more than your gold bars.

1142
01:43:58,791 --> 01:44:01,541
No! You son of a gun!

1143
01:44:04,041 --> 01:44:05,374
If you kill me,

1144
01:44:05,375 --> 01:44:09,041
my vengeance will
follow you to hell, bastard!

1145
01:44:17,750 --> 01:44:18,708
This...

1146
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,875
is for my father.

1147
01:44:36,333 --> 01:44:38,166
I'm not a murderer.

1148
01:44:39,916 --> 01:44:41,041
Not like you.

1149
01:44:59,583 --> 01:45:00,833
It's all settled.

1150
01:45:09,958 --> 01:45:11,125
How?

1151
01:45:12,541 --> 01:45:15,291
You think you're
the only one puppeteering?

1152
01:45:24,041 --> 01:45:25,250
<i>My family is in danger.</i>

1153
01:45:29,250 --> 01:45:30,790
Sorry for the trouble.

1154
01:45:30,791 --> 01:45:33,583
It's no trouble for an old friend.

1155
01:45:58,875 --> 01:45:59,916
Let's work.

1156
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:04,874
At 9:30 p.m. Day
after tomorrow at the Palace Hotel.

1157
01:46:04,875 --> 01:46:06,458
All the details are in there.

1158
01:46:29,791 --> 01:46:31,125
Be careful.

1159
01:46:38,916 --> 01:46:41,790
Bashir, I know you're angry right now.

1160
01:46:41,791 --> 01:46:43,540
- Talk!
- Just think for a minute, Bashir.

1161
01:46:43,541 --> 01:46:45,374
What would I do with the ring? Damn it!

1162
01:46:45,375 --> 01:46:47,165
Are you playing riddles with me?

1163
01:46:47,166 --> 01:46:48,625
Someone forced me to do it!

1164
01:46:49,708 --> 01:46:51,458
Someone set all this up.

1165
01:46:53,333 --> 01:46:55,540
There's a traitor in your family, Bashir.

1166
01:46:55,541 --> 01:46:57,499
<i>He told me about tonight.</i>

1167
01:46:57,500 --> 01:47:00,665
<i>You've heard of it before, right?
The Five Ivory family.</i>

1168
01:47:00,666 --> 01:47:04,583
{\an8}<i>In three days' time,
they will appoint their new leader.</i>

1169
01:47:07,250 --> 01:47:10,250
In order to bait a traitor out,

1170
01:47:13,916 --> 01:47:15,916
my coronation was sacrificed?

1171
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:17,624
You bastard!

1172
01:47:17,625 --> 01:47:20,166
Who do you think you are to decide for me?

1173
01:47:21,250 --> 01:47:23,250
All of Five Ivory

1174
01:47:24,833 --> 01:47:27,333
will worship you, Bashir.

1175
01:47:28,541 --> 01:47:31,000
If you find the traitor.

1176
01:47:33,166 --> 01:47:35,208
The traitor who betrayed you tonight

1177
01:47:35,958 --> 01:47:40,000
is the same person
who betrayed you ten years ago.

1178
01:47:52,125 --> 01:47:53,666
I would've never imagined.

1179
01:47:54,750 --> 01:47:56,750
What would you have never imagined, Uncle?

1180
01:48:18,208 --> 01:48:20,832
My family and I...

1181
01:48:20,833 --> 01:48:22,291
We're good, right?

1182
01:48:22,791 --> 01:48:23,750
Let's go.

1183
01:48:42,833 --> 01:48:44,083
Bashir.

1184
01:49:06,375 --> 01:49:07,499
We've arrived?

1185
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:08,666
Yes. Get out.

1186
01:49:15,125 --> 01:49:16,957
What are we doing here?

1187
01:49:16,958 --> 01:49:19,332
Shouldn't we go celebrate or something?

1188
01:49:19,333 --> 01:49:20,916
Didn't we say we were meeting Ah Teck?

1189
01:49:22,041 --> 01:49:24,458
We could just meet him at karaoke.

1190
01:49:31,125 --> 01:49:32,124
What is your problem?

1191
01:49:32,125 --> 01:49:34,582
I've been holding my pee in since forever.

1192
01:49:34,583 --> 01:49:37,790
If we meet at the karaoke,
I could use their loo.

1193
01:49:37,791 --> 01:49:39,708
You could have peed much earlier.

1194
01:50:05,875 --> 01:50:06,958
<i>Take care of yourself, Along.</i>

1195
01:50:08,666 --> 01:50:09,791
Keyrol!

1196
01:50:11,416 --> 01:50:13,291
I know who set Dad up.

1197
01:50:15,125 --> 01:50:17,832
The one who forced us
into stealing this ring.

1198
01:50:17,833 --> 01:50:20,666
He's the same person
who set you and Dad up ten years ago.

1199
01:50:21,750 --> 01:50:23,665
Give me a chance to repay

1200
01:50:23,666 --> 01:50:25,583
my debt to Dad!

1201
01:50:34,708 --> 01:50:36,000
You were there, weren't you?

1202
01:50:40,666 --> 01:50:41,500
That night.

1203
01:51:01,041 --> 01:51:02,958
Keyrol! Dad!

1204
01:51:34,333 --> 01:51:35,750
Forgive me, Dad.

1205
01:51:43,083 --> 01:51:44,416
Keyrol.

1206
01:51:54,458 --> 01:51:56,208
Sir! There's another one, Sir!

1207
01:51:57,458 --> 01:51:58,332
Hey...

1208
01:51:58,333 --> 01:51:59,624
Stay calm.

1209
01:51:59,625 --> 01:52:00,750
Stand up.

1210
01:52:01,666 --> 01:52:04,249
Dad.

1211
01:52:04,250 --> 01:52:05,290
- Dad!
- Hey!

1212
01:52:05,291 --> 01:52:06,999
- Dad!
- Don't move!

1213
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,332
- Dad!
- Spread his leg.

1214
01:52:09,333 --> 01:52:11,374
- My father.
- Mister.

1215
01:52:11,375 --> 01:52:12,415
Don't move!

1216
01:52:12,416 --> 01:52:13,540
Dad!

1217
01:52:13,541 --> 01:52:15,332
- Don't move.
- Stay calm. Hold him down.

1218
01:52:15,333 --> 01:52:17,374
- Dad!
- Calm down.

1219
01:52:17,375 --> 01:52:19,165
Dad is gone, Keyrol.

1220
01:52:19,166 --> 01:52:20,916
Dad!

1221
01:52:22,458 --> 01:52:25,625
<i>I know I wasn't right all this time.</i>

1222
01:52:26,666 --> 01:52:28,332
That's why for the ten years I was jailed,

1223
01:52:28,333 --> 01:52:30,000
never once did you come to see me?

1224
01:52:32,541 --> 01:52:33,500
It's not...

1225
01:52:37,291 --> 01:52:38,790
I didn't know how to face you, Keyrol.

1226
01:52:38,791 --> 01:52:40,541
Do you know all this while I thought...

1227
01:52:43,916 --> 01:52:46,082
Why didn't you tell me all these, Along?

1228
01:52:46,083 --> 01:52:47,958
What would it have done?

1229
01:52:50,583 --> 01:52:52,375
Would it have changed anything?

1230
01:53:13,791 --> 01:53:15,541
It's time we go our separate ways, Along.

1231
01:53:19,875 --> 01:53:21,000
Really?

1232
01:53:22,250 --> 01:53:23,208
Keyrol.

1233
01:53:24,500 --> 01:53:26,875
I hope, one day

1234
01:53:27,875 --> 01:53:31,166
there will be a space
in your heart to forgive me.

1235
01:53:31,916 --> 01:53:33,208
That's my only wish.

1236
01:53:40,250 --> 01:53:42,875
You want to dictate
even the space in my heart?

1237
01:53:49,041 --> 01:53:50,208
Help me to repair this.

1238
01:53:53,458 --> 01:53:54,708
Make it work again.

1239
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,666
I dropped my cigarette.

1240
01:54:30,541 --> 01:54:32,915
Why are we meeting in such a place?

1241
01:54:32,916 --> 01:54:34,749
Are you copying the Hong Kong gangsters?

1242
01:54:34,750 --> 01:54:36,832
We should've met at the karaoke.

1243
01:54:36,833 --> 01:54:37,749
I told you.

1244
01:54:37,750 --> 01:54:38,916
Ah Teck.

1245
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:42,750
Thank you.

1246
01:54:43,500 --> 01:54:45,166
You don't have to thank me.

1247
01:54:46,125 --> 01:54:48,707
How's the four-eyed prick?

1248
01:54:48,708 --> 01:54:50,416
Was it easy to make him talk?

1249
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:52,332
Not a problem.

1250
01:54:52,333 --> 01:54:54,666
He is just a toothless tiger
without his master.

1251
01:54:55,458 --> 01:54:57,666
By the way, I think
I found your belongings.

1252
01:54:58,291 --> 01:55:00,125
And I was helpful enough
to bring them along.

1253
01:55:17,625 --> 01:55:19,458
What's this?

1254
01:55:32,500 --> 01:55:33,333
Ah Teck!

1255
01:55:36,250 --> 01:55:37,707
When you needed help,

1256
01:55:37,708 --> 01:55:39,457
you said, "Help me, Ah Teck.
Help me, Ah Teck."

1257
01:55:39,458 --> 01:55:41,332
When it's time to pay, you say, "Woi."

1258
01:55:41,333 --> 01:55:42,665
What should we do, Along?

1259
01:55:42,666 --> 01:55:43,707
Just give it to him.

1260
01:55:43,708 --> 01:55:45,374
Along says just to give it to you.

1261
01:55:45,375 --> 01:55:47,041
- See you.
- Alright.

1262
01:56:06,416 --> 01:56:07,666
The smell.

1263
01:56:11,833 --> 01:56:13,250
Just wanted to know how it feels.

1264
01:56:14,291 --> 01:56:15,290
Quite nice isn't it, Emma?

1265
01:56:15,291 --> 01:56:16,708
‎Got you!

1266
01:56:18,708 --> 01:56:20,332
- Along.
- What's wrong?

1267
01:56:20,333 --> 01:56:22,125
What's wrong with Along?

1268
01:56:25,125 --> 01:56:26,290
That's hard.

1269
01:56:26,291 --> 01:56:27,208
That's really hard.

1270
01:56:27,791 --> 01:56:28,915
Angah!

1271
01:56:28,916 --> 01:56:30,749
- I got you again.
- Along's turn!

1272
01:56:30,750 --> 01:56:32,583
That hurts!

1273
01:56:33,416 --> 01:56:35,707
- Emma.
- Emma.

1274
01:56:35,708 --> 01:56:36,957
Don't you dare!

1275
01:56:36,958 --> 01:56:38,457
- Don't sit. You'll get boils!
- I dare you!

1276
01:56:38,458 --> 01:56:40,000
Emma.

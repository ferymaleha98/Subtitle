3
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:43,208
Let's use this opportunity wisely to
silence everyone with just a fingertip

4
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:47,666
and remind those who forgot our
land and people after gaining power,

5
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:54,583
ensuring that Advocate Sri Anil Baby,
who is deeply connected to his birthplace,

6
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:58,000
wins by a large majority.

7
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,000
Hey... What's up?

8
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,166
I'm here to deposit the gun.

9
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,833
You show up only when
elections are declared.

10
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,875
You can head over to the
officer on the right.

11
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,583
- Number?
- 1624/MPM.

12
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,000
License?

13
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:15,958
- It's a revolver?
- Yes.

14
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,458
- You haven't used it recently, right?
- No, no.

15
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:27,625
Rounds...

16
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,416
- Okay, then.
- Okay.

17
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,250
Has everyone turned
in their guns?

18
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:55,291
No.

19
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,166
- One Mr. Appu Pillai is left.
- Okay.

20
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:02,791
Please show your IDs.

21
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,041
Mom, my ID.

22
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,041
- There are two witnesses, right?
- Yes, yes.

23
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,583
Show the ID proof.

24
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,375
Aparna...

25
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:16,583
Groom's ID?

26
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:17,875
Here it is.

27
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:20,833
Full name?

28
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,083
Ajayachandran K. V.

29
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,333
Ajayachandran.

30
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,541
Father's name?

31
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:26,791
K. Appu Pillai.

32
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,291
You've come from quite far, huh?

33
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:30,791
How did you end up here?

34
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:31,833
Where's he from?

35
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:32,875
Nedunchal.

36
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:33,958
Nedunchal...

37
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,666
Oh! That's the place with many
eco-tourism attractions, isn't it?

38
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:37,875
- Yes.
- Okay.

39
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:41,541
Ajayetta,

40
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:43,875
it's from the police station.

41
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:47,791
- Sir...
- Okay.

42
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,125
Just a minute.

43
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,250
- Are you Ajayan?
- Yes.

44
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:55,625
- Appu Pillai?

45
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:56,958
He is my father.

46
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,583
Not that.
Is Appu Pillai with you now?

47
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,541
Sir, I'm not home at the moment.

48
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:01,833
- What about your dad?

49
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,250
Dad is at home.

50
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,625
But he didn't answer
when we called your home.

51
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,041
Dad doesn't really use
the landline much, Sir.

52
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,500
That's for outgoing calls, right?

53
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,833
He can still answer
incoming calls, can't he?

54
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:13,333
It's not that, Sir.
He isn't comfortable using it.

55
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:14,666
What's the matter, Sir?

56
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,875
Appu Pillai is a gun
license holder, right?

57
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:18,916
Yes.

58
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:22,208
Did you see the notice asking for
licensed firearms to be surrendered?

59
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,791
- No.
- But there is such a notice.

60
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,958
It is mandatory.
Today's the last date.

61
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,375
Oh! Due to the elections, right?

62
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,791
I had read it in the newspaper.

63
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,375
It must be brought to
the station before noon.

64
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,125
I'll reach home
by around 4.30 PM.

65
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,041
Will it be late if I
come after that, Sir?

66
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,458
My dad doesn't go out much.

67
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,500
- That will be late.

68
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:39,750
Where is your house?

69
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,041
Nedunchal.

70
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,208
- Where in Nedunchal?

71
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:44,125
On the way to Thirunelli.

72
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:45,583
Is it near the forest office?

73
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,250
- It is before the forest office.
- Okay.

74
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,708
The house is known as
Kodaykkal Veedu, Sir.

75
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,583
Okay. We will go and
collect it ourselves.

76
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,541
- Is it regarding the gun?
- Yes.

77
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,291
Why are you so
stressed about it?

78
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,791
He would have found it by now.

79
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:15,083
[phone rings]

80
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,416
- Dad...
- Yes.

81
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:18,791
Did you find it?

82
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:19,833
No.

83
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,375
I received a call
from the station.

84
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:22,916
They've asked me to get
it there before noon.

85
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,625
If not, will they
court-martial me?

86
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,458
I have been searching
for it since dawn.

87
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:31,375
If I don't find it, tell them I'll
carve a wooden gun and hand it over.

88
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:35,250
Damn circulars and surrender
notices, all for a puny pistol!

89
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,541
I'll call you when I find it!

90
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:37,583
Hang up now!

91
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:43,583
That's what I told you...

92
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:46,625
We should've filed a petition this
morning when he said it was missing.

93
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:48,291
That's for our safety as well.

94
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,541
If someone has stolen it

95
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,041
and fires it somewhere,

96
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,666
we need to have
solid backing, right?

97
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,500
I'm just talking about
the worst-case scenario.

98
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,833
Isn't it better than
having to say it's missing

99
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,500
when the police come
to the house for it?

100
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,291
I understand, Shivetta.

101
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,333
I'd even told Dad
that we must file a petition.

102
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,041
It's because Dad
objected, right?

103
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,416
Okay.

104
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:08,833
Anyway, let him continue searching.

105
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,500
Finish what you came here for.
Come.

106
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,166
Okay.

107
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,791
- Happy married life!
- Thank you, Sir.

108
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:24,541
- Okay, then.
- Okay.

109
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:25,666
Okay, then.

110
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,125
- Okay.
- See you.

111
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,291
Aparna...

112
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:32,500
Why didn't you come inside?

113
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:33,666
I just got here.

114
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,458
He is Praveena's brother.

115
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:37,791
- Prashobh.
- Hi.

116
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,375
Come home once you're settled.

117
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:41,958
Okay.

118
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:44,791
How long are you on leave for?

119
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,250
I haven't received the call yet.

120
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,750
I'll be here for
two months anyway.

121
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,041
Okay.

122
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,166
You guys carry on.

123
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,250
It's getting late, right?

124
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,250
All the best.

125
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,750
Shall we go?

126
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,166
[Kishkindha Kaandam]

127
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,250
Smith & Wesson, 9mm.

128
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,625
It is a pistol, right?

129
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,083
Yes.

130
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,250
It's been three years since
the license was renewed, right?

131
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,291
Yes.

132
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,833
- That's the one.
K. Appu Pillai.

133
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,291
Okay.

134
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
- Sir...
- Yes.

135
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,541
Everything's good in
the station records.

136
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,166
In February 2021,

137
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:27,000
he had surrendered the
pistol to renew the license.

138
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:30,458
So, after completing the renewal,
we returned it as well, right?

139
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,333
Yes, Sir.

140
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:32,583
As a former army officer,

141
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,833
you must be aware of
the hassles behind this, right?

142
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,291
How can people like you be
so careless in handling it?

143
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,166
You are?

144
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,750
- I am his son.
- What do you do?

145
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,791
I work in the Forest
Department, Sir.

146
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,041
Shivadasettan's...

147
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,333
Yes.

148
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,791
He had mentioned your wedding
when he requested two days off.

149
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:49,833
Congrats.

150
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,875
The notice to deposit the gun was
issued well in advance, right?

151
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,375
And you're only saying the gun is
missing now, at the last minute?

152
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,791
- Errr....
- What is this, Shivadasetta?

153
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,333
How did this even happen
with you around?

154
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,166
Well, Sir...
I just got to know from Ajayan.

155
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,375
Fine. But they could have at
least informed the station

156
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,291
right away when they realized
it was missing, right?

157
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,875
If this election hadn't come up,

158
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,541
would they have even
realized it was missing?

159
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,416
What if someone misuses it?

160
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,166
Have you thought about it?

161
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:13,833
Have YOU thought about it?

162
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,083
I'm not someone who
thinks too much!

163
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,541
If it's acceptable, we can write
the petition from here and sign it.

164
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,041
Hey, just write it
and give it to them.

165
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,250
Or... if your ego
doesn't allow that,

166
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,958
I'll come to the station
tomorrow morning.

167
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,375
They totally ruined the
day the newly-weds arrived.

168
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,958
I don't think he gets
how serious this is.

169
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,916
- You got it, right?
- Yes.

170
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,333
Anyway, give a written complaint.

171
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,166
- And search the house thoroughly.
- Sir.

172
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,583
Attach a copy of the
gun license as well.

173
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:39,875
- Okay.
- Okay, then.

174
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,708
- I'll be on duty tomorrow.
- Okay, fine.

175
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,375
No, this isn't
exactly Thirunelli.

176
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,916
This place is before that,
along the Thirunelli route.

177
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:58,500
You said the license was
renewed three years ago, right?

178
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,458
Hasn't Dad taken
it out since then?

179
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,375
It's not a daily-use item

180
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,041
to take out and use
every day, is it?

181
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:10,291
So, people like him, who
can't even keep a gun safe,

182
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,750
were the ones guarding
our country's borders?

183
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,791
Aparna must be
quite impressed, right?

184
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:18,583
Where is she?

185
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:20,416
She is talking on the phone.

186
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:21,750
She is okay, right?

187
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:23,250
She is.

188
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,291
I could sense that she
is quite chilled out.

189
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,791
What is it, dude?

190
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,625
Nothing...

191
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,208
Come on. Cheer up.

192
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,041
Don't make her anxious
with your overthinking.

193
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,916
Okay, just keep one thing in mind.

194
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,500
Everyone is okay with it.

195
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,583
It's just your feeling
that it is not okay.

196
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,791
And it's not right to live
your life in solitude.

197
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,916
There must be some
happenings in life, right?

198
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,791
This isn't just about you.

199
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,833
You must think
about Dad too, right?

200
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:53,625
You get what I'm saying, right?

201
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:55,958
Yes.

202
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,000
She is coming.

203
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,333
It's my elder brother.

204
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,541
Hi!

205
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:03,666
Hello.

206
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,083
How is our place?

207
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,541
It's awesome!

208
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,375
I left home a long time ago.

209
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:10,458
I'm not in contact
with anyone there,

210
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,833
not even with that
'Hitler' in the house.

211
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,291
He told me.

212
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,708
Well, when are you
going back to Bangalore?

213
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,875
Or are you on leave?

214
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,666
I resigned from my
job before I got here.

215
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,333
How come?

216
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:23,833
I got bored.

217
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,500
So, what's the next plan?

218
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,958
I haven't thought
about any plans yet.

219
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,000
I thought I'll just
go with the flow.

220
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,416
That's cool!

221
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:34,333
No job can give you the joy of
living without having to work.

222
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,583
Mr. Prasad, please come.

223
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,416
Job calls! I'll call later.

224
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,166
- Good night.
- Good night.

225
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:41,750
Dude...

226
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,708
- Good night.
- Good night.

227
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,291
Today was a mess, right?

228
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,708
I wonder what your dad felt.

229
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:57,791
Nothing like that.

230
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,125
My dad is cool with it.

231
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,916
So, there are others who
were not cool with it.

232
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,083
Seems like Prasadettan and
your dad are just so in sync!

233
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:15,708
You know how old
people are, right?

234
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,791
Moreover, he follows military discipline.

235
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,875
Don't worry.
Dad isn't all that troublesome.

236
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:23,458
Ask Maniyan to come
tomorrow with two people.

237
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,083
That... uh...

238
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:28,458
Or should I climb
trees at the age of 70?

239
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,416
Yes, it's a radio.

240
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,833
Puyinkara Kavu is right
next to this place.

241
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:30,000
And what you see over there
is the Reserve Forest.

242
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,375
Except for Hanuman and Sugriva,

243
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,208
you can find the entire
army of monkeys here.

244
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:37,583
Oh!

245
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,416
One fine morning,
our radio went missing.

246
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,250
It was after around a month,

247
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,916
that we found it
hanging on this branch.

248
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:49,375
It's not at a height where
you can grab it easily, right?

249
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,041
Hearing about this, many
people came to see it.

250
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,458
Seeing the comments from
people and their astonishment,

251
00:15:56,125 --> 00:16:01,291
Dad ordered it to be left on the tree
for everyone's amusement from then on.

252
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,375
And there's no option to appeal
against your dad's order, right?

253
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,958
That order served its
purpose, didn't it?

254
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,458
You were also staring with
your mouth wide open, right?

255
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:13,083
If you look closely, you will
see many more items up there.

256
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,166
Dolls...

257
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:15,708
Toys...

258
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,958
Monkeys were Chachu's
enemy number one.

259
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,625
He had even tried to capture
monkeys with a rat trap.

260
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:34,583
Is it coming from Dad's room?

261
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:36,625
Yes.

262
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,416
That's his regular playlist.

263
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,916
You will have to bear with it.

264
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,458
It is a North-East folk song, right?

265
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,000
Yes. Have you heard it before?

266
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:48,416
I had been part of a volunteer
camp while I was in Delhi.

267
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,666
We went to Nagaland,
Mizoram... and so on.

268
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,500
Dad was in Arunachal
Pradesh for many years.

269
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,916
Hey, shall I share a thought with you?

270
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,083
It could be silly.

271
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:06,208
Can't you approach the missing
gun case from this angle?

272
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:10,708
Well... a gun isn't exactly something
too heavy for a monkey to pick up, is it?

273
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,791
So, didn't you hear the
order Dad gave last night?

274
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,500
- Maniyan?
- Yes.

275
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,541
- Maniyan chetta... Wooh!

276
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,375
- This side... This side!

277
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,500
- Look in every nook
and corner, okay?

278
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:45,583
- Shashiyetta!
Check that mango tree branch!

279
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,208
- Can you see a black object?

280
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:48,666
- No!

281
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,083
- That's a sandal or something like that!

282
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,666
- Hey, tighten the knot!

283
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,416
- Check that tree as well!

284
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,500
- Where all should we search?

285
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Ah!

286
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:04,250
Now, if a branch snaps
and someone falls,

287
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,291
we will have to deal with that too!

288
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:07,375
- Right?
- Come on!

289
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,041
What if we find the gun?

290
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,291
You always take his side!

291
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,708
Whether it's a thief or a monkey,

292
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,125
if the gun gets fired,
we will be in a soup.

293
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,333
- Throw it!

294
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:23,291
If that happens, no one will be interested
in climbing or shaking the tree anymore.

295
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,291
So, shall I leave?

296
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,833
My duty is outside
the station today.

297
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:24,750
[North East folk song playing]

298
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:39,833
Huh?

299
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,166
Building only the flyover pillars
won't lead to development.

300
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,750
Have someone explain
this to my election opponent.

301
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:12,500
Isn't it true?

302
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:15,708
The locals have started growing
veggies under the flyover,

303
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,083
which has only had its pillars
built in the last 10 years.

304
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,833
- Beans and what not! So...

305
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,958
- Don't try to fool the people with that.

306
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,375
Park your vehicle
to the side, bro!

307
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:27,541
- Just a minute. Let that
busy person pass through.

308
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,375
Why are you trying to
squeeze through this traffic?

309
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,166
- Wait! I have much more to say!

310
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:32,708
Sir, you can move forward.

311
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,541
- Allow them to pass through.

312
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,083
- We needn't achieve anything by
obstructing people.

313
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:38,708
Move the auto rickshaw!

314
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,875
Let those in a hurry go ahead.

315
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,250
Come!

316
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:47,791
Go, go!

317
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,125
Creating a fuss during
such a major event!

318
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,875
Didn't you say he's
always at home?

319
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,458
He doesn't go outside very often.

320
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,208
How long has it been since
he retired from the army?

321
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:04,541
It must be around 10-16 years.

322
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,875
His elder son and I were classmates.

323
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,458
He had a very good
reputation back then.

324
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,166
Is it bad now?

325
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,416
Err, that's not what I meant.

326
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,291
- Dasan.
- Yes.

327
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:23,416
Here you go.

328
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,250
You've added nutmeg, right?

329
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:31,041
Yes. Shaiju Sir likes that flavour.

330
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,416
He has set a menu for himself.

331
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:38,875
Sumadathan Chetta...

332
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:40,708
Look!

333
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:48,916
You carry on.
I'll come later.

334
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,875
Well... Everyone is already there.

335
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:53,041
- I'll be there by the time they start.
- Okay.

336
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,416
- Their office is based in Delhi.

337
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:09,166
- I had asked if they have
an office in the South.

338
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:11,125
So, you've spoken to them once before.

339
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:13,458
- They are like a bypass channel.
- Just a minute.

340
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,291
I had sent them Chachu's
photos and details earlier.

341
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:17,708
Oh!

342
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,041
- So, they are just mediators.
- Yes.

343
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,833
- Another NGO is dealing with this.

344
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:24,291
Only after verifying the
details we've submitted

345
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:26,583
and confirming the
parents in person

346
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:28,083
will they connect us to them.

347
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:29,125
Okay.

348
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,458
- It's okay now.
- That is their policy.

349
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:33,125
Prashobh, we got connected.

350
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,958
Okay. So, you talk to them.

351
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:36,291
I'll send the link.

352
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:37,708
- Okay.
- This is the window.

353
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:39,625
- Ajayetta...
- Yes.

354
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,125
- Well... Aparna Chechi
is with you, right?

355
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:43,791
Huh?

356
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:47,000
- I mean, she must be...
okay with this, right?

357
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:49,958
Of course.

358
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,291
I had told her before
the wedding, right?

359
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:54,125
- I was just asking... Okay.

360
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:56,000
- Anyway, call me
after the meeting.

361
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,458
- Okay, then.
- Okay.

362
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:07,958
Hi, good evening.

363
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:09,083
Good evening.

364
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,125
[in Hindi] Sorry, I got
held up with some work.

365
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:13,166
So, I couldn't schedule
the meeting earlier.

366
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:15,208
- That's okay.
- Okay.

367
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:16,791
Then, we'll start?

368
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,250
Sure.

369
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:21,333
- Since when do you know Gaurav?

370
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:24,333
- Actually, I don't know him in person.

371
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:26,708
- He is a colleague of Prashobh.

372
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:27,916
- Oh, your in-law.

373
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,250
So, you have never met him?

374
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:30,916
- No. Actually, it's like...

375
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:33,000
- they had a chat
and put me through.

376
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:36,208
Chinmay, called as...

377
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:38,500
Chachu.

378
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:39,833
Yes.

379
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,041
You are...

380
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,583
Ajayachandran K. V.

381
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:43,583
Yes.

382
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:44,916
- And...

383
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:46,250
- Mother's name...

384
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:48,500
- Praveena Ajayachandran.

385
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:50,208
Yes.

386
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:52,000
Umm... where's Praveena?

387
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,333
She is...

388
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:58,000
- She can join if she wants to.

389
00:23:58,416 --> 00:24:00,958
- No, I mean...
She passed, actually.

390
00:24:01,291 --> 00:24:02,458
- It's been two years now.

391
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,625
- Oh, sorry.

392
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:08,583
So, how old was Chachu
at the time of missing?

393
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:09,833
Seven.

394
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:11,583
- And date of missing?

395
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:14,791
3 years back.

396
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:16,750
March 20th,

397
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:18,541
2021.

398
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,583
- So how long did you follow up
initially with the classifieds?

399
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:25,958
- It went on for like...
seven days, initially.

400
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,458
Can you tell me the languages
he was familiar with?

401
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,541
Only Malayalam.

402
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:43,041
But he could understand English
to an extent.

403
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:44,583
- Okay.

404
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:46,708
Alright, Ajay.

405
00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:48,833
I'll forward these
to the higher desk.

406
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:51,166
- They will reach you once
the paperwork is complete.

407
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:54,125
- Thank you.
- Nice talking to you.

408
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:57,750
Pleasure.

409
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:18,125
Ajayetta, these also need
to be sent out today.

410
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:20,958
- To Thirunelli, right?
- Yes.

411
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:28,500
This time, I have
changed the ingredients.

412
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,708
Keep it inside.

413
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:31,375
Baby Sir got lucky today, huh?

414
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:38,083
Does he pay anything
to Sumadathan Chettan?

415
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:40,833
Since it's for booze, he won't
be his usual stingy self.

416
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:44,500
I'm telling you, the first question
will be if he has Google Pay.

417
00:25:45,541 --> 00:25:47,500
No, no.
He has paid for it.

418
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,291
I thought you'd be on
leave this whole week.

419
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:52,166
A new person has arrived, right?

420
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:53,750
Not going on a
honeymoon trip, Ajayan?

421
00:25:53,791 --> 00:25:54,875
No.

422
00:25:54,916 --> 00:25:56,916
Didn't you say she's
a nature freak?

423
00:25:56,916 --> 00:25:59,041
At least take her for
a stroll in the forest.

424
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:01,666
What was she doing
in Bangalore? IT?

425
00:26:01,958 --> 00:26:03,250
She started off with IT.

426
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,500
- She left it when she lost interest.
- Is it?

427
00:26:05,541 --> 00:26:06,583
Then, she pursued MSW.

428
00:26:06,625 --> 00:26:08,416
And worked with their
syllabus-making team in Bangalore.

429
00:26:08,458 --> 00:26:09,791
Isn't that correct, Ajayetta?

430
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:11,541
[phone rings]
- Yes.

431
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:13,541
And a bit of theatre
and travel in between.

432
00:26:13,666 --> 00:26:15,500
She has come here
leaving all that behind.

433
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,375
She is a perfect
match for Ajayettan.

434
00:26:17,416 --> 00:26:20,791
We get that Ajayan is stuck here
since his father is alone here.

435
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:24,458
But shouldn't these younger girls have
a clarity about what they want to do?

436
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,541
Isn't it enough to have clarity about
what they shouldn't do, Mohanetta?

437
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:29,333
- Hmm. Okay.

438
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:30,583
- Yes.

439
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:31,916
11th block, right?

440
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:34,208
I'll be there soon.
Give me 10 minutes. Okay.

441
00:26:34,916 --> 00:26:36,791
- Please check these too.
- Okay.

442
00:26:37,166 --> 00:26:39,583
Listen, a shot has been
fired in the forest.

443
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:41,375
Are the Maoists active again?

444
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:42,500
Let's go visit the place.

445
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,541
It was Shaiju who called.

446
00:26:43,541 --> 00:26:44,875
He is at the spot now.

447
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,791
Where is it?

448
00:26:45,833 --> 00:26:48,125
There's a truck-way that goes up
from Kallepathi, right? Over there.

449
00:26:48,166 --> 00:26:49,500
- 10th block?
- No.

450
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:50,666
- Hey, Tony.
- Yes.

451
00:26:50,666 --> 00:26:52,375
- Get me the Jeep keys.
- Okay.

452
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:54,791
I think it's at the boundary
between 11 and 12.

453
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:56,333
They fired shots at
one of our signboards.

454
00:26:56,375 --> 00:26:57,250
Great!

455
00:26:57,291 --> 00:26:59,458
And you wanted me to take
her on a trip to this forest?

456
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,875
Things were finally
getting calm.

457
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:02,708
Now, the people will
get talking again!

458
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:04,500
Don't exaggerate.

459
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:06,000
They too have
needs, don't they?

460
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,416
Yeah, right! As if they need
to fire shots to make a living!

461
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:14,833
- I'll bring the Jeep.
- Okay.

462
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:19,458
- Hi...
- Hi.

463
00:27:33,291 --> 00:27:34,833
- As we all know,

464
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:37,666
- gunfire is nothing new in
the Kallepathi forest region.

465
00:27:37,666 --> 00:27:43,250
- It was in April that the Thunderbolt team
arrested two people for weapons training.

466
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:45,375
- How many times will you
repeat the same thing?

467
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:47,000
It's not as if I've applied
for a passport, is it?

468
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:48,583
It is management protocol, Sir.

469
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,625
We can only do it once all the
requirements we listed are met.

470
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:52,166
I've come after asking about it
over a phone call.

471
00:27:52,208 --> 00:27:53,750
You didn't tell me about
this protocol then!

472
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:56,125
It's not that. We had
a server update last week.

473
00:27:56,166 --> 00:27:57,208
- So...
- So, you lost it?

474
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,250
It is not lost, Sir.

475
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,250
- When we did the server update...
- So, you can get it.

476
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,708
Sir, I didn't mean that.

477
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,458
Just tell me whether you can
get it for me or not.

478
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:05,541
That's what I said, Sir.
We'll know only after checking.

479
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,875
- Do you want me to check it?
- No, Sir. Just a minute.

480
00:28:08,666 --> 00:28:12,166
Hey, girl. You only need half the time
you're wasting on excuses to get it done.

481
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:13,333
Instead of doing
it, you are just...

482
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:14,875
- Can you quickly check the back-up files?
- What?

483
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:16,416
- Some sort of confusion, it seems.
- What?

484
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:18,500
Have you come here earlier
for the same thing, Sir?

485
00:28:18,541 --> 00:28:20,625
Do things get done here
based on prior acquaintance?

486
00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:21,666
Okay.

487
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,333
Is your name Appu Pillai, Sir?

488
00:28:23,708 --> 00:28:24,708
Yes.

489
00:28:24,791 --> 00:28:26,750
Age 70, birth star is Chothi,

490
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:28,000
Zodiac sign is Libra.

491
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:30,333
Yes.
Err, okay.

492
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,875
Sir, you've been requested to go
to the Lay Secretary's office.

493
00:28:34,708 --> 00:28:36,000
Sir, your umbrella!

494
00:28:37,166 --> 00:28:39,208
- The locals informed the police

495
00:28:39,208 --> 00:28:44,000
- that they heard continuous
gunfire for just a brief period.

496
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:46,583
- Anyway, there were no
casualties this time as well.

497
00:28:46,583 --> 00:28:50,583
- The locals and police believe someone
was involved in weapons training.

498
00:29:13,416 --> 00:29:15,875
Couldn't they choose a better
spot for their shooting practice?

499
00:29:15,916 --> 00:29:17,541
Right at the elephant's butt?
Really?

500
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,958
Didn't you say that
they too have needs?

501
00:29:21,041 --> 00:29:22,916
- We will have to put up a new one.
- Yes.

502
00:29:23,708 --> 00:29:26,291
One game in front and
another through the back!

503
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:29,458
Everyone is aware
of your nasty past!

504
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,583
Prakashan, save your jabs
for those who'll take it.

505
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:32,875
Don't try to mess with me.

506
00:29:32,916 --> 00:29:35,000
Let's see how long you'll
keep this going,

507
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,916
by supplying hooch
and hauling jugs!

508
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:39,250
If you talk nonsense,
I will smack your face!

509
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:41,166
If I don't get you arrested,
then my name isn't Prakashan.

510
00:29:41,208 --> 00:29:43,333
It's easy to pick
low-hanging fruit, right?

511
00:29:43,416 --> 00:29:44,791
He is the temporary
watcher here.

512
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:46,625
You must have heard about him;
Sumadathan.

513
00:29:46,916 --> 00:29:49,208
He was involved in some Naxal
activities back in the past,

514
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,375
discreetly.

515
00:29:50,416 --> 00:29:52,958
He used to make home-made bombs.

516
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:55,583
One day, one blew up in his
hands while he was making it.

517
00:29:55,625 --> 00:29:58,250
That's when everyone found
out about his real profile.

518
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,708
This happened 40 years ago.

519
00:29:59,875 --> 00:30:01,166
He gave it all up back then.

520
00:30:01,208 --> 00:30:03,000
He gave it up.
But you know, right?

521
00:30:03,291 --> 00:30:04,625
Once someone's name
is on the list,

522
00:30:04,666 --> 00:30:06,500
even if they cleanse
themselves in the Ganges,

523
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,083
people will still see
them the same way!

524
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,083
Try getting me arrested!

525
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:11,458
Your tricks won't work on me!

526
00:30:12,666 --> 00:30:14,416
No cartridges or caps
have been recovered.

527
00:30:14,541 --> 00:30:17,666
And from the bullet impact points,
it's clear they didn't use rifles.

528
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:19,833
- Are you saying it isn't them?
- I didn't mean that.

529
00:30:19,833 --> 00:30:21,958
I just pointed out that it's
different from their usual pattern.

530
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,541
From the evidence
we have so far,

531
00:30:23,666 --> 00:30:25,583
we can assume it's either
a revolver or a pistol.

532
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:27,333
Anyway, it's a small gun.

533
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:33,083
- And did you ask Dad about this?
- Sigh!

534
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:34,750
What can I ask him?

535
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,125
Don't frame it like a question.

536
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:39,541
Just make a general statement saying
this is what the ballistic team said.

537
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,958
They just said that
it could be a pistol.

538
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:44,875
And you already concluded
that it is Dad's gun?

539
00:30:44,916 --> 00:30:47,375
You started seeing our dad
only after I did, kiddo!

540
00:30:47,416 --> 00:30:49,166
Both of them are old buddies.

541
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,375
Does he still visit Dad?

542
00:30:51,625 --> 00:30:53,041
- Who? Suman chettan?
- Yes.

543
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:55,583
He rarely comes home.

544
00:30:55,958 --> 00:30:58,083
It's true that he carried
us around as kids.

545
00:30:58,083 --> 00:31:00,000
But I've never thought he was
someone we could keep ties with,

546
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:01,791
whether it was back then or now.

547
00:31:02,666 --> 00:31:04,583
- You do--
- Papa, can we go out?

548
00:31:04,583 --> 00:31:05,583
Where?

549
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:07,375
- Downstairs.
- Now?

550
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:08,291
- Yes.
- Let's go after saying goodbye to uncle.

551
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:09,333
Who is it?

552
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:10,625
- No!
- Ichu?

553
00:31:10,666 --> 00:31:12,500
- Talk to your uncle.
- Uncle's dear Ichuma?

554
00:31:12,541 --> 00:31:13,583
Hey...

555
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,000
Let me see.
Show me your teeth!

556
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,375
Eeee....

557
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,791
Show your teeth... eeeee....

558
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:21,166
Bonjour!

559
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:22,500
What did she say?

560
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,625
She said, 'Bonjour'.

561
00:31:23,666 --> 00:31:24,875
Oh, Bonjour!

562
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,708
Oh, no! Don't pull my hand!

563
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,875
Don't run. Let me see you!

564
00:31:27,916 --> 00:31:30,125
- Come on, Papa! Come!
- Ichu...

565
00:31:30,541 --> 00:31:31,625
Let's go.

566
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:32,875
Okay, dude. Gotta go.

567
00:31:32,916 --> 00:31:34,041
Otherwise, she won't leave me.

568
00:31:34,083 --> 00:31:35,291
- I'll talk to you later. Bye.

569
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:37,208
- Come, come! Let's go!

570
00:31:38,958 --> 00:31:39,958
Okay.

571
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:45,916
Was it Prasadettan?

572
00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:47,250
Yes.

573
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,583
What is he saying?

574
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:50,541
Nothing.

575
00:31:50,583 --> 00:31:51,875
His usual talk.

576
00:31:54,958 --> 00:31:56,000
It's 7.30 PM.

577
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,333
Dad isn't back home yet.

578
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,166
Should we try calling him?

579
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:00,166
No.

580
00:32:00,208 --> 00:32:01,458
He will come.

581
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,166
This time is normal for home.

582
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:05,916
Must he go on his own if
he wants to buy something?

583
00:32:05,958 --> 00:32:08,083
If he says it, someone will
buy and bring it, right?

584
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:11,041
Dad is very particular
about certain things.

585
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,708
He has to do it all by himself.

586
00:32:12,791 --> 00:32:14,625
Even if we offer help,
he won't accept it.

587
00:32:36,958 --> 00:32:38,541
Okay. No, no!

588
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,250
I'll start now itself.

589
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:42,958
Did you check the
petrol level, Dad?

590
00:32:43,916 --> 00:32:45,125
Okay. I'm coming.

591
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:48,166
Dad's car isn't starting.
Let me go and check.

592
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:50,291
I will come with you.

593
00:33:23,916 --> 00:33:25,958
- Dad...
- What took you so long?

594
00:33:39,541 --> 00:33:40,916
It maybe due
to the cold weather.

595
00:33:40,916 --> 00:33:42,375
The battery was due
for replacement.

596
00:33:42,416 --> 00:33:44,125
Then you should have
replaced it, right?

597
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:45,541
What else do you
have to remember?

598
00:33:46,416 --> 00:33:48,833
What if I ended up stranded
somewhere with no phone signal?

599
00:35:03,583 --> 00:35:05,333
No one else owns
land in this area.

600
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:07,458
All the land up to
the stream is ours.

601
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:10,375
Would it be the workers
from the nearby plot?

602
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,625
They were there until 7.30 PM.

603
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:14,916
What work were they
doing at night?

604
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:17,583
Let me go and check.

605
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:20,166
Is that enough?
It's dense forest over there.

606
00:35:20,208 --> 00:35:21,375
I'll bring a torchlight.

607
00:36:21,583 --> 00:36:24,208
Err... how often do
you come around here?

608
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:26,583
Nobody really comes around here.

609
00:36:26,666 --> 00:36:27,666
Oh.

610
00:36:27,791 --> 00:36:30,625
Have you ever seen anything else
burned to ashes like this here before?

611
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:32,375
No.

612
00:36:32,375 --> 00:36:34,375
And you haven't seen a fire
like this before either?

613
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:35,416
No.

614
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:38,333
By looking at the ground here,
it doesn't appear that way.

615
00:36:39,208 --> 00:36:40,250
Look at this.

616
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:45,875
The forest has grown evenly
across the surroundings,

617
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:50,083
just like the other
areas in this compound.

618
00:36:51,666 --> 00:36:55,041
But within a two-foot
radius of the burnt spot,

619
00:36:55,041 --> 00:36:57,166
new short grasses have sprouted.

620
00:36:58,458 --> 00:36:59,750
When I removed the topsoil,

621
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,208
I found burnt ashes underneath.

622
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:04,833
It's clear that things have been
burned here several times before.

623
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:08,958
Where is your boundary
on the east side?

624
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:12,291
There are two wild jack trees
10 metres away from that stream.

625
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:14,291
Okay. And beyond that?

626
00:37:14,708 --> 00:37:16,583
It was my land. I sold it.

627
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:18,625
Oh, the land purchased by
those folks from Kottayam?

628
00:37:18,666 --> 00:37:19,750
- Yes.
- Okay, okay.

629
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:23,125
This burned area is still
within your boundary, isn't it?

630
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:25,375
A resurvey won't be necessary, right?

631
00:37:33,791 --> 00:37:36,625
Maybe the workers from the nearby
plot burned some waste there.

632
00:37:38,791 --> 00:37:40,583
When someone goes
out to burn waste,

633
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,500
will they count the
number of wild jack trees?

634
00:37:42,958 --> 00:37:44,583
- That's what I also said.
- Okay.

635
00:37:44,666 --> 00:37:47,041
But she wanted to verify
it the police way.

636
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,583
Ah, that's good.

637
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:51,000
I rarely get to play
the police around here.

638
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:55,041
Ah...

639
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:56,875
Does Sumadathan Chettan
come here?

640
00:37:58,666 --> 00:37:59,666
No.

641
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,291
Why do you ask?

642
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:05,166
There's talk that your dad
visits Sumadathan Chettan often.

643
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,916
After the Kallepathi
gunshot incident,

644
00:38:08,041 --> 00:38:10,208
there's such a talk going on
at the station as well.

645
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:11,666
Well...

646
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:13,458
I know he won't get
involved in such things.

647
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:16,541
But still, ask him to steer clear
of that company for a while.

648
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:18,666
Why get into unnecessary trouble?

649
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Right?

650
00:38:34,666 --> 00:38:36,083
- Shivadasettan!
- Yes.

651
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:48,083
Belgaum is in Karnataka, right?

652
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:49,500
Yes.

653
00:39:01,291 --> 00:39:02,375
Sumadathan?

654
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:04,250
We call him 'Suman Chettan'.

655
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:06,791
He used to come home
regularly before.

656
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:09,708
He was very fond of my elder
brother and me when we were kids.

657
00:39:10,708 --> 00:39:12,958
Is it for sure that he has
quit his Naxalite activities?

658
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:17,250
Hey, even when Dad was involved in
it, he never kept anything secret.

659
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:20,041
He's straightforward
in every aspect.

660
00:39:20,541 --> 00:39:23,708
That... old... Nilambur case.

661
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,500
I had heard about it
from Dad himself.

662
00:39:25,916 --> 00:39:27,208
Nilambur case?

663
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:30,125
In the 1970s, Naxalite movements
were strong in this region.

664
00:39:30,875 --> 00:39:33,375
The burning of the Records
Room at the Munsiff Court

665
00:39:33,416 --> 00:39:35,125
was a major case back then.

666
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:37,958
Dad's name was on
the list of suspects.

667
00:39:38,666 --> 00:39:39,791
And then?

668
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,916
Since my grandfather
was quite influential,

669
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:45,333
he managed to get
my dad off the case.

670
00:39:46,208 --> 00:39:48,375
However, he didn't let
Dad stay here any longer.

671
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:49,708
He was banished immediately.

672
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:53,041
It was only after that event
that he joined the military.

673
00:39:53,708 --> 00:39:55,208
Your grandpa was
really something, huh?

674
00:39:55,208 --> 00:39:56,208
Of course!

675
00:39:56,375 --> 00:39:58,125
He was my dad's father, after all!

676
00:40:08,416 --> 00:40:09,708
I called you several times.

677
00:40:10,083 --> 00:40:11,791
You know how the
signal is out here, right?

678
00:40:11,916 --> 00:40:12,958
What happened?

679
00:40:12,958 --> 00:40:14,875
We've received a mail
regarding Chachu's matter.

680
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:16,291
It is from Karnataka.

681
00:40:26,541 --> 00:40:28,625
It's not as if we didn't
make an effort to find him.

682
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:31,708
On the day he went
missing and the day after,

683
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:35,583
there were reports of people spotting
Chachu in Pollachi and Tirupur.

684
00:40:35,625 --> 00:40:38,375
Back then, all of us did
everything we could, to find him.

685
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,125
Praveena Chechi was lucky.

686
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,750

this prolonged stress

I...

689
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,500
There's a game that Chachu loved.

690
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:04,916
I was trying to
remember its name.

691
00:41:05,875 --> 00:41:07,791
He'll start playing it
as soon as he wakes up.

692
00:41:08,208 --> 00:41:09,541
He was crazy about it.

693
00:41:10,916 --> 00:41:13,833
He'd say that he'll find the treasure
after completing six more levels.

694
00:41:22,791 --> 00:41:24,000
To be honest,

695
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,333
I couldn't give him
any attention at all,

696
00:41:31,041 --> 00:41:34,000
especially after
Pravi's treatment began.

697
00:41:37,291 --> 00:41:39,166
Then, how will I remember
the name of the game?

00:42:28,875 --> 00:42:32,833
[indistinct conversation in Kannada]

703
00:42:42,041 --> 00:42:43,833
[speaking in Kannada]

704
00:42:46,833 --> 00:42:47,833
Kamal!

705
00:42:52,291 --> 00:42:53,833
[speaking in Kannada]

706
00:43:01,666 --> 00:43:03,625
[speaking in Kannada]

707
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:05,708
Ajay Chandra! Come.

708
00:44:22,166 --> 00:44:23,208
Let's go.

709
00:44:35,833 --> 00:44:37,791
Well, this receipt won't do.

710
00:44:38,125 --> 00:44:40,375
That's why I asked you to
come when everyone is here.

711
00:44:41,625 --> 00:44:43,250
Okay, I'll come later and collect it.

712
00:44:43,458 --> 00:44:45,708
Please tell me these
details for now, Chetta.

713
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:47,625
Full name?

714
00:44:47,666 --> 00:44:49,125
It's in the paper
I gave you.

715
00:44:51,375 --> 00:44:52,416
House name?

716
00:44:52,583 --> 00:44:53,833
That's also in it, right?

717
00:44:54,875 --> 00:44:55,875
Wife?

718
00:44:57,291 --> 00:44:58,916
I'm asking your wife's name.

719
00:44:59,958 --> 00:45:01,000
She is no more.

720
00:45:01,208 --> 00:45:02,208
She passed away.

721
00:45:03,666 --> 00:45:04,666
Children?

722
00:45:05,625 --> 00:45:06,625
Ajayan.

723
00:45:08,166 --> 00:45:09,416
Is it just 'Ajayan'?

724
00:45:16,208 --> 00:45:17,666
Ajayachandran K.V.

725
00:45:18,166 --> 00:45:19,208
Don't you have one more son?

726
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,916
If you know everything,
why are you asking me?

727
00:45:21,166 --> 00:45:22,416
I'm asking his name.

728
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:24,625
Prasad Chandran K.V.

729
00:45:26,541 --> 00:45:28,291
Chetta, I need a
few more details.

730
00:45:28,333 --> 00:45:29,875
I don't want to trouble
you any further.

731
00:45:29,916 --> 00:45:31,791
If there's anyone else here,
please call them.

732
00:45:37,666 --> 00:45:39,416
He didn't use my name
when he called for me.

733
00:45:39,458 --> 00:45:41,125
He addressed me as 'Hey,' 'You,' etc.

734
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:42,750
And he was really angry as well.

735
00:45:43,458 --> 00:45:44,916
But later when he saw me,

736
00:45:44,916 --> 00:45:46,333
he didn't ask me anything.

737
00:45:46,708 --> 00:45:48,125
He wasn't angry at all

738
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:50,041
and acted as if
nothing had happened.

739
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:52,666
Then?

740
00:45:53,666 --> 00:45:55,500
- Then, it was only when
I checked his phone,

741
00:45:55,541 --> 00:45:56,708
- that it really struck me.

742
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,541
- He had only less
than 10 contacts.

743
00:45:59,833 --> 00:46:03,625
- But their identities and
details were saved in brackets.

744
00:46:06,208 --> 00:46:07,583
There are some things...

745
00:46:08,458 --> 00:46:09,791
They are just my doubts.

746
00:46:10,125 --> 00:46:12,583
But I feel hesitant to share
it until I know for sure.

747
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,583
Did you call that
carpenter after that?

748
00:46:18,625 --> 00:46:19,625
What, Dad?

749
00:46:19,666 --> 00:46:21,541
I asked if you called
the carpenter after that!

750
00:46:22,375 --> 00:46:23,750
Yes, I had called him.

751
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:25,333
Calling and talking alone
won't suffice.

752
00:46:25,333 --> 00:46:26,583
The work should get done!

753
00:46:26,666 --> 00:46:28,708
We didn't ask him to build
a snake boat, did we?

754
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:30,416
It's just to fix a
door lock, right?

755
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:32,416
I will call him once again, Dad.

756
00:46:32,541 --> 00:46:34,125
Otherwise, I'll ask
someone else to come.

757
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,958
I want my door
repaired today itself,

758
00:46:36,041 --> 00:46:38,583
even if it takes calling in
Perumthachan, the master carpenter.

759
00:46:45,541 --> 00:46:46,916
Did you enter Dad's room?

760
00:46:48,833 --> 00:46:51,291
He can instantly tell if someone
else has been in his room.

761
00:46:51,416 --> 00:46:52,833
That's what I don't understand.

762
00:46:52,958 --> 00:46:55,958
Why must he react this way if a
family member has entered his room?

763
00:46:56,208 --> 00:46:57,458
Dad doesn't like it.

764
00:46:57,541 --> 00:46:58,833
He will react.

765
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:09,708
Have you ever wondered
why he acts that way?

766
00:47:13,458 --> 00:47:15,083
I found this in Dad's room.

767
00:47:17,166 --> 00:47:19,875
You said Dad takes only
insulin tablets, right?

768
00:47:20,583 --> 00:47:21,916
This is not an insulin strip.

769
00:47:22,041 --> 00:47:24,291
These are anti-depressants,

770
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:28,041
and Google says they're mainly
prescribed to neuro patients.

771
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,500
Actually, it's not just
this particular incident.

772
00:47:32,958 --> 00:47:36,750
His manner of speaking and dealing
with people often feels strange.

773
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:40,375
And... the day Dad's friend
from the army visited,

774
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,250
that man was very talkative,

775
00:47:42,291 --> 00:47:44,500
but Dad seemed
overwhelmed by panic,

776
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:46,291
almost as if he was confused.

777
00:47:46,708 --> 00:47:48,208
He had a small
notepad in his hand,

778
00:47:48,666 --> 00:47:52,958
and seemed to be reading from it
for all his questions and responses.

779
00:47:53,375 --> 00:47:56,458
And after his friend left, I saw Dad
scribbling something on it, as well.

780
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:02,083
Remember the day he called us
saying the car wouldn't start?

781
00:48:02,166 --> 00:48:04,208
Now I have a doubt
about that incident as well.

782
00:48:04,708 --> 00:48:07,833
What if he had stopped after getting
confused about the way back to our house?

783
00:48:11,833 --> 00:48:14,458
I think we must consult
a doctor, Ajayetta.

784
00:48:17,333 --> 00:48:18,958
Sorry, I didn't mean to...

785
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,541
Dad's having a bit of
trouble remembering things.

786
00:48:33,083 --> 00:48:34,375
Just like you
pointed it out now,

787
00:48:34,833 --> 00:48:36,958
the first person to notice it
and inform me was...

788
00:48:37,291 --> 00:48:38,375
Chachu.

789
00:49:04,125 --> 00:49:05,958
We brought it up with Dad once.

790
00:49:06,416 --> 00:49:07,750
Like you said now,

791
00:49:07,916 --> 00:49:09,583
we suggested consulting
a doctor too.

792
00:49:10,416 --> 00:49:11,416
Mom!

793
00:49:15,291 --> 00:49:16,958
I had never seen
my dad like that.

794
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:24,500
Our plan was to sit down with Dad,
speak calmly, and convince him somehow.

795
00:49:25,083 --> 00:49:26,375
That was when...

796
00:49:26,541 --> 00:49:29,125
Uncle Jacob, who was in the army
with Dad, paid us a visit.

797
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:41,958
Don't you know that Dad doesn't
really talk much, Uncle?

798
00:49:42,708 --> 00:49:45,750
Ever since mom passed away,
he has been silent most of the time.

799
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:49,333
So, nothing seemed
unusual to us.

800
00:49:51,916 --> 00:49:55,875
I had assumed he was probably
undergoing some neurological therapy.

801
00:49:57,625 --> 00:50:00,333
But when you say that
none of you had any clue

802
00:50:00,375 --> 00:50:03,541
about this medical condition
of his for all these years...

803
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:04,875
Phew!

804
00:50:05,041 --> 00:50:06,541
That's incredible, man!

805
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:08,833
He must be doing
something extraordinary.

806
00:50:09,291 --> 00:50:11,750
He doesn't want even you
to know about it, Ajayan.

807
00:50:12,458 --> 00:50:14,250
Not talking much to anyone...

808
00:50:14,375 --> 00:50:16,625
and avoiding socializing
outside his house

809
00:50:17,458 --> 00:50:18,958
must be his strategy.

810
00:50:20,708 --> 00:50:22,666
He's scared his actions
will give him away.

811
00:50:23,291 --> 00:50:24,791
He is a proud man.

812
00:50:27,875 --> 00:50:29,500
He would have recognized you, right?

813
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:34,916
Since he has his old army
pictures framed on his wall,

814
00:50:34,958 --> 00:50:36,625
he would definitely
get the connection.

815
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:38,250
Beyond that,

816
00:50:38,541 --> 00:50:41,250
what he remembers
and what he doesn't...

817
00:50:42,083 --> 00:50:43,083
God knows!

818
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:45,500
When did you notice it first, Uncle?

819
00:50:48,541 --> 00:50:50,958
So, you have no idea about
the whole picture, Ajayan?

820
00:50:51,583 --> 00:50:54,041
You know why he was fired
from the army service?

821
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,208
Fired?

822
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:02,125
- Pillai's was a kind of
obsessive perfectionism.

823
00:51:02,375 --> 00:51:04,083
- Uncompromising attitude.

824
00:51:05,083 --> 00:51:06,708
- He was extremely strict

825
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:11,041
- in ensuring that neither he nor his
battalion made even the smallest mistake.

826
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:17,166
- Initially, his forgetfulness was
a running joke in our friend circle.

827
00:51:18,958 --> 00:51:22,500
- I have witnessed some issues
caused by his forgetfulness.

828
00:51:23,625 --> 00:51:25,416
- Without letting many
people know about it,

829
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:27,458
- he was able to
manage it brilliantly.

830
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:31,791
- But such minor forgetfulness

831
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,041
- eventually led to
major complications.

832
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:38,916
- He misplaced a service pistol.

833
00:51:40,791 --> 00:51:43,791
- It escalated into an issue that
Pillai couldn't cover up in any way.

834
00:51:44,041 --> 00:51:46,916
- In fact, he had been
aware for quite some time

835
00:51:47,083 --> 00:51:49,000
- that something was not right with him.

836
00:51:49,166 --> 00:51:51,375
- Not only did he evade
medical check-ups,

837
00:51:51,583 --> 00:51:54,125
- but he also tried to keep his
condition hidden from everyone.

838
00:51:54,708 --> 00:51:55,791
- Perhaps he was reluctant

839
00:51:55,833 --> 00:51:58,791
- to deal with the controversy and
embarrassment if everyone found out.

840
00:52:01,916 --> 00:52:06,166
Eventually, one of our team members
found the gun by coincidence

841
00:52:06,416 --> 00:52:08,250
from the washing machine
in the army quarters.

842
00:52:10,833 --> 00:52:13,166
It was only because Pillai's
service records were good,

843
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:18,541
and out of the concern that this might
damage the force's goodwill if exposed,

844
00:52:19,208 --> 00:52:21,833
that the top authorities
kept the news confidential.

845
00:52:22,208 --> 00:52:24,833
He was terminated with immediate effect.

846
00:52:30,541 --> 00:52:33,000
It's not for any other reason
that I didn't tell you.

847
00:52:33,833 --> 00:52:36,041
It's been 16 years since
Dad came back from the army,

848
00:52:36,833 --> 00:52:38,375
and in these 16 years,

849
00:52:39,416 --> 00:52:41,416
he's only been trying
to do one thing;

850
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,791
making sure no one
discovers his memory issues,

851
00:52:47,333 --> 00:52:48,833
and facing it all by himself.

852
00:52:51,125 --> 00:52:53,208
Just imagine the struggle
he's been enduring for it.

853
00:52:54,333 --> 00:52:55,875
That's the kind
of man my dad is.

854
00:52:57,083 --> 00:52:59,166
Both in this town and
during his service,

855
00:53:00,458 --> 00:53:02,125
that's the kind of
reputation he had.

856
00:53:03,375 --> 00:53:04,708
Regardless of what he loses,

857
00:53:05,625 --> 00:53:09,416
he cannot afford to let
his dignity be affected.

858
00:53:10,208 --> 00:53:11,666
It might be because of his ego.

859
00:53:12,625 --> 00:53:14,125
If that is what Dad wants,

860
00:53:14,666 --> 00:53:16,458
we should stand by him, right?

861
00:54:11,291 --> 00:54:13,041
Where is Mumma's Chachu?

862
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:15,041
Look at what Papa is doing.

863
00:54:15,083 --> 00:54:16,416
Look, dear!

864
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,208
Do you see Papa's new camera?

865
00:54:18,458 --> 00:54:19,625
- Look at the new camera.

866
00:54:20,666 --> 00:54:22,000
- Smile!

867
00:54:23,583 --> 00:54:25,375
It's okay.
I'll go with him.

868
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,291
- Hey... Look over there!
- Chachu!

869
00:54:27,333 --> 00:54:28,541
Chachu, you must not cry!

870
00:54:28,541 --> 00:54:29,833
- Look at the monkey jumping!

871
00:54:29,875 --> 00:54:31,041
- Don't cry, Chachu!

872
00:54:31,083 --> 00:54:32,166
See... it jumped.

873
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:34,000
- Did you see him jump over there?
- Okay.

874
00:54:35,833 --> 00:54:37,291
Is this Sumadathan?

875
00:54:38,666 --> 00:54:39,750
Yes.

876
00:54:40,916 --> 00:54:42,375
Papa, come!

877
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,458
- Mummy!
- Hey, you will fall down!

878
00:54:48,333 --> 00:54:50,000
Chachu!

879
00:54:50,916 --> 00:54:52,500
Hey, no! Don't shoot water at me!

880
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,458
- Hey, hey!

881
00:55:00,916 --> 00:55:03,916
- Jack fruit! I want jack fruit!
- He wouldn't climb unless you agreed!

882
00:55:03,958 --> 00:55:06,250
- I want it!
- Get him down, Ajayetta!

883
00:55:06,333 --> 00:55:07,333
- No! No!

884
00:55:09,041 --> 00:55:10,041
- Yes!

885
00:55:10,875 --> 00:55:13,125
Oh!

886
00:55:14,583 --> 00:55:15,958
- Enough, Chachu!

887
00:55:15,958 --> 00:55:17,708
- Your intestine will flip!
- Okay.

888
00:55:19,041 --> 00:55:20,541
- Superman!
- Superman!

889
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:22,166
- Superman!
- Come on, fly!

890
00:55:22,333 --> 00:55:23,791
Bring him down!
He will fall!

891
00:55:23,791 --> 00:55:24,958
- Won't you listen?

892
00:55:24,958 --> 00:55:27,666
- How many times should I tell you?
- He is fine.

893
00:55:27,833 --> 00:55:29,166
Come down, I say!

894
00:55:29,166 --> 00:55:31,166
- Are you happy now that
you got it from Grandpa?

895
00:55:31,208 --> 00:55:32,708
How was Dad with Chachu?

896
00:55:38,291 --> 00:55:39,291
Huh?

897
00:55:39,333 --> 00:55:41,250
How was Dad's behaviour
towards Chachu?

898
00:55:43,791 --> 00:55:45,583
Chachu was about
two and a half years old

899
00:55:46,541 --> 00:55:48,416
when Praveena was
first diagnosed.

900
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,458
After that,

901
00:55:50,666 --> 00:55:54,250
both of us were fully occupied
with tests and treatment.

902
00:55:55,041 --> 00:55:56,958
Chachu was mostly with Dad.

903
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,083
A friction has always existed

904
00:55:59,458 --> 00:56:01,250
due to Dad's strict
military discipline.

905
00:56:02,833 --> 00:56:04,708
It was way more intense
with my elder brother.

906
00:56:05,958 --> 00:56:07,333
No, Chachu!

907
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,416
- Your Papa has come!

908
00:56:10,541 --> 00:56:11,750
- Hey, watch your step!

909
00:56:11,791 --> 00:56:12,791
Papa!

910
00:56:12,833 --> 00:56:15,708
- What he remembers
and what he doesn't...

911
00:56:15,833 --> 00:56:16,833
- God knows!

912
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:18,791
Why did you ask that?

913
00:56:20,291 --> 00:56:21,666
Could there be anything else

914
00:56:21,875 --> 00:56:23,583
that he might have forgotten?

915
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:32,083
Anything related to
Chachu's missing?

916
00:56:37,458 --> 00:56:38,625
Hello.

917
00:56:39,708 --> 00:56:40,791
Yes.

918
00:56:42,083 --> 00:56:43,458
Where is this exact location?

919
00:56:45,083 --> 00:56:46,208
Who are you?

920
00:56:47,041 --> 00:56:48,083
Okay.

921
00:56:48,125 --> 00:56:49,833
Make sure nobody gets close to it.

922
00:56:50,583 --> 00:56:51,625
Okay, okay.

923
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:00,916
The day he went missing...

924
00:57:01,666 --> 00:57:05,291
Was it the day you went to the hospital
with Praveena Chechi for her check-up?

925
00:57:06,375 --> 00:57:07,375
Yes.

926
00:57:09,333 --> 00:57:11,291
It was when you
returned home at night,

927
00:57:11,333 --> 00:57:14,208
that you realized that
Chachu was missing.

928
00:57:15,458 --> 00:57:16,458
That means...

929
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,500
it occurred when only
Dad and Chachu were here.

930
00:57:23,791 --> 00:57:25,666
What if Dad knew...

931
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,166
what happened to
Chachu that day?

932
00:57:29,666 --> 00:57:31,500
What if he has forgotten
what he knew?

933
00:58:04,625 --> 00:58:06,500
- How many workers are there?
- Eight of my workers.

934
00:58:06,541 --> 00:58:07,875
Did he answer when you called?

935
00:58:07,916 --> 00:58:09,500
Joy Sir is at Mundakkayam, Sir.

936
00:58:09,541 --> 00:58:12,250
Even if he's in Antarctica, tell
him to be here by dawn tomorrow.

937
00:58:13,708 --> 00:58:15,583
- What?
- Okay. I'll call him.

938
00:58:15,583 --> 00:58:17,416
Go and call him then!
Whom are you waiting for?

939
00:58:17,416 --> 00:58:18,416
Okay.

940
00:58:18,458 --> 00:58:20,833
It's been only two years
since Joy bought this land.

941
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,833
From whom did he buy it?

942
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
The land belonged to the
person living next door.

943
00:58:25,291 --> 00:58:26,958
One Mr. Appu Pillai.

944
00:58:40,916 --> 00:58:42,125
When will they reach?

945
00:58:42,125 --> 00:58:43,500
They've crossed Nedunchal.

946
00:58:44,416 --> 00:58:46,750
- Dig over there too.
- That area.

947
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:48,125
One of you come here.

948
00:58:48,166 --> 00:58:49,958
Take care of things here.
I'll be right back.

949
00:58:51,083 --> 00:58:53,166
Didn't I tell you I'd come
home when this is over?

950
00:58:53,208 --> 00:58:54,625
Why did you come here?

951
00:58:57,333 --> 00:58:59,875
It was the workers who saw it
while digging for the foundation.

952
00:59:00,791 --> 00:59:02,291
Take him home with you.

953
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:03,750
I'll come there before I leave.

954
00:59:04,333 --> 00:59:05,791
- Go.
- Shivetta...

955
00:59:07,125 --> 00:59:08,833
Do you have any idea
whose it might be?

956
00:59:09,125 --> 00:59:10,750
The forensic team
hasn't reached yet.

957
00:59:10,875 --> 00:59:13,083
Further procedures will be
conducted after they arrive.

958
00:59:13,541 --> 00:59:14,708
Come.

959
01:00:10,875 --> 01:00:12,666
It doesn't seem that
big in size, right?

960
01:00:22,666 --> 01:00:24,250
- Start from the middle.
- Okay.

961
01:00:33,166 --> 01:00:35,375
Though it's from
the primate family,

962
01:00:35,625 --> 01:00:37,625
the skeleton isn't
that of a human.

963
01:00:37,666 --> 01:00:38,666
Huh?

964
01:00:43,291 --> 01:00:45,083
The Reserve Forest
is nearby, isn't it?

965
01:00:57,625 --> 01:00:59,750
Once I realized it was
a monkey's remains,

966
01:00:59,791 --> 01:01:02,333
I thought it would be a case
that's limited to our usual set-up.

967
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,375
Wildlife Department, right?

968
01:01:04,708 --> 01:01:06,125
Since it's a non-bailable case,

969
01:01:06,125 --> 01:01:07,583
the one who did it
must have buried it.

970
01:01:08,833 --> 01:01:10,791
Let's wait for the report
from the veterinary centre.

971
01:01:12,125 --> 01:01:13,416
The report is out already.

972
01:01:13,708 --> 01:01:15,916
I came by to talk
about that as well.

973
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:18,833
As of now, even the
police will get involved,

974
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:21,625
since it comes
under the Arms Act.

975
01:01:22,416 --> 01:01:23,458
Arms Act?

976
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:27,000
What's the status of your
father's gun missing case?

977
01:01:38,916 --> 01:01:41,875
Pillai Chettan sold the property
to Joy, two years back, right?

978
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:43,916
Yes.

979
01:01:43,916 --> 01:01:45,958
Did he mention
anything about this?

980
01:02:30,083 --> 01:02:31,166
What happened?

981
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:35,458
The monkey's postmortem
report is out.

982
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:36,625
Okay.

983
01:02:36,666 --> 01:02:38,166
The cause of death
is bullet injury.

984
01:02:38,791 --> 01:02:39,833
Bullet?

985
01:02:39,875 --> 01:02:40,666
Yes.

986
01:02:40,666 --> 01:02:42,375
What's the owner of
the property saying?

987
01:02:44,416 --> 01:02:45,833
He is out of the picture.

988
01:02:47,041 --> 01:02:49,333
He purchased the property
from us, two years back.

989
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,500
The monkey's remains they
found are three years old.

990
01:03:12,541 --> 01:03:14,083
Sorry!
Have you been waiting for long?

991
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:19,250
That veterinary officer just left after
going on and on with the whole story!

992
01:03:25,958 --> 01:03:28,375
He says that there's
an exit wound,

993
01:03:28,625 --> 01:03:30,916
and based on the patch
on the monkey's bone,

994
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,250
it could be from a
0.32 calibre bullet,

995
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:35,541
or perhaps a larger calibre.

996
01:03:37,083 --> 01:03:40,541
What's the latest on Appu Pillai's missing
firearm case that you mentioned to me?

997
01:03:40,875 --> 01:03:42,541
The calibre of Appu
Pillai's gun is 0.35.

998
01:03:42,875 --> 01:03:44,166
So, it could be that too.

999
01:03:44,208 --> 01:03:45,958
It was during my time as
the SHO at this station

1000
01:03:45,958 --> 01:03:47,958
that Appu Pillai applied
for his gun license.

1001
01:03:48,458 --> 01:03:51,083
I had met him back then as part
of the verification process.

1002
01:03:51,833 --> 01:03:53,083
He is quite grumpy.

1003
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:55,333
Wasn't it from his family
that a boy went missing?

1004
01:03:55,375 --> 01:03:57,083
Yes, it's been almost
three years now.

1005
01:03:57,125 --> 01:04:00,000
Even before that, he had gone missing
from school a couple of times.

1006
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,458
The kid just takes
off on his own!

1007
01:04:01,666 --> 01:04:05,291
Both times, his family and the school
authorities managed to find him at night.

1008
01:04:05,541 --> 01:04:07,000
Where was he then?

1009
01:04:07,125 --> 01:04:09,791
The kid was making up
stories like it was a movie.

1010
01:04:09,875 --> 01:04:12,458
Yet the story he told had no
connection to where he was found.

1011
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:14,291
When he went missing
for the third time,

1012
01:04:14,333 --> 01:04:15,958
or rather the last time,

1013
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:17,916
upon hearing that he
went missing again,

1014
01:04:18,083 --> 01:04:20,666
everyone thought, âThe crazy
boy has taken off yet again.â

1015
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:22,416
Are you saying nobody even
tried to look for him?

1016
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:24,416
- No, I didn't mean that.
- We tried our maximum, Sir.

1017
01:04:24,416 --> 01:04:26,750
There were people who had
spotted a boy of Chachu's age

1018
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:28,416
at Palakkad railway
station that night.

1019
01:04:28,833 --> 01:04:31,958
And on the same night, around
2:00 a.m., at Pollachi too.

1020
01:04:32,875 --> 01:04:35,125
It's been a couple of years
since the boy's mother died.

1021
01:04:35,166 --> 01:04:37,458
She was frequently sick
and often in the hospital.

1022
01:04:37,583 --> 01:04:40,750
I guess the boy got frustrated since
no one was giving him enough attention.

1023
01:04:44,833 --> 01:04:46,750
Chachu, stop! Chachu...

1024
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:49,333
Chachu! Stop there, boy!

1025
01:04:49,458 --> 01:04:50,458
Son!

1026
01:04:50,458 --> 01:04:51,458
Chachu!

1027
01:04:53,791 --> 01:04:55,083
Stop there, son!

1028
01:04:55,125 --> 01:04:56,833
Chachu, stop!
Son!

1029
01:04:57,666 --> 01:04:58,916
Just stop there!

1030
01:04:59,375 --> 01:05:00,375
Chachu!

1031
01:05:01,041 --> 01:05:02,166
Stop there, son!

1032
01:05:02,208 --> 01:05:03,208
Chachu!

1033
01:05:03,708 --> 01:05:04,708
Chachu!

1034
01:05:07,208 --> 01:05:08,500
Wake up, Sir.

1035
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:09,916
School's dispersed.
Don't you want to go home?

1036
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:12,916
Walk.

1037
01:05:12,958 --> 01:05:14,125
Walk, elephant.

1038
01:05:53,958 --> 01:05:55,291
Dad, why didn't
you take the car?

1039
01:05:55,958 --> 01:05:57,208
The car's out of petrol.

1040
01:05:57,666 --> 01:05:59,125
But I filled it up just yesterday!

1041
01:06:00,458 --> 01:06:01,791
Get in, Dad.

1042
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,041
I'm heading home too.

1043
01:06:24,083 --> 01:06:26,541
The case of the monkey's
remains found in the field

1044
01:06:26,583 --> 01:06:28,416
is now being investigated by
the Forest Vigilance department.

1045
01:06:28,958 --> 01:06:30,375
Did you know about it?

1046
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:31,750
Nobody informed me.

1047
01:06:32,958 --> 01:06:34,333
It wasn't found from my property!

1048
01:06:36,958 --> 01:06:38,250
What did the owner say?

1049
01:06:38,916 --> 01:06:40,041
The property owner?

1050
01:06:40,041 --> 01:06:41,333
Who else could be
the owner here?

1051
01:06:42,333 --> 01:06:43,333
Well...

1052
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:45,833
Joy Sir bought the land from us

1053
01:06:46,125 --> 01:06:47,583
only two years back, right?

1054
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:51,541
The remains found are
about three years old.

1055
01:06:54,791 --> 01:06:56,333
It was killed by a gunshot.

1056
01:06:59,958 --> 01:07:03,875
Apparently, a small gun, possibly
a pistol, was used to kill it.

1057
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:05,833
Who said so?

1058
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:07,541
I mean...

1059
01:07:07,916 --> 01:07:09,291
The test results say so.

1060
01:07:09,791 --> 01:07:11,000
Just because of that,

1061
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,666
it can't be assumed
that the gun is mine.

1062
01:07:13,291 --> 01:07:14,416
You...

1063
01:07:14,541 --> 01:07:15,875
You needn't worry about it.

1064
01:07:16,166 --> 01:07:17,833
They will keep on
asking such questions.

1065
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:21,666
Is the question theirs or yours?

1066
01:07:35,125 --> 01:07:36,333
Shall we go to bed?

1067
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:44,500
Do you have a policy against
making things easy for people?

1068
01:07:44,541 --> 01:07:45,833
Sir, this is beyond our--

1069
01:07:45,833 --> 01:07:47,833
Listen!
Please consider my age, the time...

1070
01:07:47,916 --> 01:07:49,833
Why are you making
things difficult for me?

1071
01:07:50,375 --> 01:07:51,625
I want it right now.

1072
01:07:51,666 --> 01:07:54,000
Since there has been a server
update, we need to check it.

1073
01:07:54,041 --> 01:07:55,833
If it's available, we have
no problem in giving it, Sir.

1074
01:07:55,875 --> 01:07:57,333
Can you please wait
for five minutes?

1075
01:07:58,041 --> 01:07:59,166
I will wait.

1076
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:00,875
Okay.

1077
01:08:01,666 --> 01:08:02,875
Hello.

1078
01:09:02,041 --> 01:09:03,708
[THIRUNELLI - NEDUNCHAL]

1079
01:09:33,458 --> 01:09:34,875
Finally!

1080
01:09:34,958 --> 01:09:36,875
[in Tamil] I thought you must
be away on a family tour.

1081
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:38,375
Please come.

1082
01:09:39,416 --> 01:09:42,666
I waited for a long time, and when
you didn't turn up, I called your son.

1083
01:09:42,833 --> 01:09:44,666
He said he's gone
out with his wife.

1084
01:09:55,541 --> 01:09:57,041
Oh! This photo came here?

1085
01:09:57,208 --> 01:09:58,750
It was there, no?

1086
01:09:58,916 --> 01:10:00,333
But this is the
perfect spot for it.

1087
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:03,875
This picture brings back all the
wild memories from that crazy night!

1088
01:10:04,708 --> 01:10:06,000
It was crazy, buddy.

1089
01:10:23,625 --> 01:10:24,916
I'll come in a moment.

1090
01:11:16,625 --> 01:11:19,833
How's the work at the
cardamom estate coming along?

1091
01:11:20,083 --> 01:11:22,375
It's hard to manage
with just cardamom.

1092
01:11:22,625 --> 01:11:25,125
Planting something else alongside
it would help balance things out.

1093
01:11:25,583 --> 01:11:28,000
The workers' attitude
is different now.

1094
01:11:28,583 --> 01:11:30,583
I need to be around all the time
to make sure they do their work.

1095
01:11:32,125 --> 01:11:33,625
How is Aravind?

1096
01:11:33,666 --> 01:11:35,041
Aravind is doing very good.

1097
01:11:35,583 --> 01:11:37,041
He just got a new
job last month.

1098
01:11:37,458 --> 01:11:38,750
He is going to Australia.

1099
01:11:39,291 --> 01:11:41,125
He is planning to settle there.

1100
01:11:41,875 --> 01:11:43,833
But once he goes,
he won't be coming back.

1101
01:11:45,083 --> 01:11:46,083
He isn't answering.

1102
01:11:46,208 --> 01:11:47,458
Anything wrong?

1103
01:11:47,583 --> 01:11:48,625
Nope.

1104
01:11:48,666 --> 01:11:50,625
Sometimes, he doesn't answer
calls if he's with someone.

1105
01:11:51,541 --> 01:11:53,625
Living there is
supposedly safer.

1106
01:11:53,958 --> 01:11:55,750
He claims we're
all backward here.

1107
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,208
Today's youth are moving to the UK,
Australia, and Canada and settling down.

1108
01:12:00,583 --> 01:12:01,875
The youth are over there,

1109
01:12:02,041 --> 01:12:03,250
while the elders remain here.

1110
01:12:03,875 --> 01:12:05,000
By the way,

1111
01:12:05,083 --> 01:12:06,916
how is your knee after surgery?

1112
01:12:06,958 --> 01:12:09,708
Many people hesitate to
acknowledge their memory problems,

1113
01:12:09,708 --> 01:12:12,125
and we should approach
them with greater care.

1114
01:12:12,166 --> 01:12:15,333
Arguing with them will only cause panic.

1115
01:12:15,458 --> 01:12:18,000
They might become paranoid,
their blood pressure could rise,

1116
01:12:18,041 --> 01:12:20,708
and they could even
lose touch with reality.

1117
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:21,791
It depends.

1118
01:12:21,833 --> 01:12:23,125
How about recovery?

1119
01:12:23,166 --> 01:12:24,666
It cannot be guaranteed.

1120
01:12:24,833 --> 01:12:27,333
Long-time acquaintances,
languages,

1121
01:12:27,375 --> 01:12:29,750
and the surroundings of their
house, which they engage with daily,

1122
01:12:29,791 --> 01:12:31,791
could become ingrained
in their habitual memory.

1123
01:12:31,833 --> 01:12:34,416
So, they may or may
not forget all of this.

1124
01:12:34,458 --> 01:12:35,916
It varies from person to person.

1125
01:12:38,041 --> 01:12:40,083
If he became willing to
depend on someone else,

1126
01:12:40,125 --> 01:12:42,333
he wouldn't have to deal
with so much stress, right?

1127
01:12:43,083 --> 01:12:46,791
People with this condition usually have
trouble trusting the people around them.

1128
01:12:47,583 --> 01:12:49,958
They can't tell who'd take
advantage of them or how, right?

1129
01:12:50,541 --> 01:12:52,083
They will always
have that insecurity.

1130
01:12:54,375 --> 01:12:56,458
If my memory is correct,

1131
01:12:58,041 --> 01:13:00,750
Me, you, Charan and Jacob...

1132
01:13:01,583 --> 01:13:02,958
All of us went in a Jeep, right?

1133
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:06,083
You remember Jacob, right?

1134
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:07,750
He downed a full bottle!

1135
01:13:07,791 --> 01:13:10,875
And he drove the Jeep
recklessly at full speed.

1136
01:13:10,916 --> 01:13:13,500
I honestly thought he'd crash,
and that would be the end of us!

1137
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,875
He finally stopped the car
at 7th Lane, near Lal Chowk,

1138
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,500
and right in front of the Major's
quarters, he urinated on the road.

1139
01:13:21,875 --> 01:13:24,083
The guard came running
and started shouting at us.

1140
01:13:24,416 --> 01:13:28,541
You were the one who pleaded
with him and said sorry.

1141
01:13:28,791 --> 01:13:30,333
He only let Jacob go after that.

1142
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:41,166
Jacob...

1143
01:13:41,791 --> 01:13:43,250
How do you know Jacob?

1144
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:44,833
What a question!

1145
01:13:45,083 --> 01:13:47,000
Weren't we all together in Kashmir?

1146
01:13:48,166 --> 01:13:50,625
But Jacob has never
been to Kashmir.

1147
01:13:54,208 --> 01:13:55,625
Oh, yeah.

1148
01:13:56,583 --> 01:13:58,166
True, true, true, man.

1149
01:13:58,458 --> 01:14:00,166
Sometimes, I lose it completely.

1150
01:14:00,916 --> 01:14:02,833
My memory isn't as sharp as yours.

1151
01:14:03,166 --> 01:14:04,750
I'm turning 73 in
the coming June.

1152
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:07,500
You must give me some
memory tips, mate.

1153
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:10,583
No fan?

1154
01:14:10,583 --> 01:14:12,166
No wonder I'm sweating like this.
Phew!

1155
01:14:13,625 --> 01:14:16,416
[sings an old Tamil song]

1156
01:14:16,458 --> 01:14:18,291
You still haven't told
me how you know Jacob.

1157
01:14:21,416 --> 01:14:22,625
When was it?

1158
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:25,875
I know him from our time
at the Itanagar camp.

1159
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:28,041
Arunachal Pradesh.

1160
01:14:28,416 --> 01:14:29,458
Yeah.

1161
01:14:29,875 --> 01:14:31,083
Yeah, man.

1162
01:14:31,125 --> 01:14:32,208
Yeah, same.

1163
01:14:32,208 --> 01:14:33,666
I met him there, too.

1164
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,125
But...

1165
01:14:35,125 --> 01:14:36,875
that was in 1986.

1166
01:14:38,208 --> 01:14:39,708
When you came last time,

1167
01:14:40,333 --> 01:14:41,791
you had told me that
in 1986,

1168
01:14:41,833 --> 01:14:43,333
you were in IPKF, right?

1169
01:14:46,833 --> 01:14:48,041
Did I say so?

1170
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:50,291
Yes, yes.
Of course!

1171
01:14:50,291 --> 01:14:51,791
Peace Keeping Force.

1172
01:14:51,791 --> 01:14:53,000
Rajiv Gandhi.

1173
01:14:53,041 --> 01:14:54,333
I was in IPKF.

1174
01:14:55,125 --> 01:14:56,708
If you were with IPKF,

1175
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:58,333
you must have been in Jaffna.

1176
01:14:58,791 --> 01:15:00,125
In Sri Lanka.

1177
01:15:02,541 --> 01:15:03,541
Yeah.

1178
01:15:05,333 --> 01:15:07,125
If you were in Sri Lanka,

1179
01:15:07,166 --> 01:15:09,166
how did you come to
know Jacob in Arunachal?

1180
01:15:14,541 --> 01:15:15,916
Why are you lying?

1181
01:15:16,375 --> 01:15:17,583
What?

1182
01:15:17,583 --> 01:15:19,250
Why are you lying to me?

1183
01:15:22,541 --> 01:15:23,708
Lying?

1184
01:15:24,041 --> 01:15:25,250
Me?

1185
01:15:26,375 --> 01:15:27,750
Why should I lie to you?

1186
01:15:29,583 --> 01:15:30,625
If so,

1187
01:15:30,625 --> 01:15:32,791
everything I just
said was a lie.

1188
01:15:33,583 --> 01:15:35,416
I was just bluffing.

1189
01:15:36,666 --> 01:15:39,291
You were okay with all
the lies I told you.

1190
01:15:40,708 --> 01:15:42,416
What is this adjustment for?

1191
01:15:42,833 --> 01:15:44,083
Who are you?

1192
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:46,541
Who are you?

1193
01:15:51,958 --> 01:15:53,083
Actually...

1194
01:15:53,166 --> 01:15:54,458
One second.
I'll be right back.

1195
01:16:44,125 --> 01:16:45,125
Hi, Son.

1196
01:16:45,166 --> 01:16:46,666
Good that you came now.

1197
01:16:46,666 --> 01:16:47,916
I was about to leave.

1198
01:16:48,375 --> 01:16:50,166
- Hello, Aparna.
- Hi.

1199
01:16:50,166 --> 01:16:51,500
Why are you leaving in a hurry?

1200
01:16:51,958 --> 01:16:53,250
Coming here wasn't in my plans.

1201
01:16:53,458 --> 01:16:55,125
I had to head to the estate

1202
01:16:55,166 --> 01:16:57,375
but thought I'd pay a
quick visit to Pillai.

1203
01:16:57,750 --> 01:16:58,958
All okay here?

1204
01:16:59,416 --> 01:17:00,416
Yeah, yeah.

1205
01:17:00,958 --> 01:17:02,250
We are just...

1206
01:17:03,375 --> 01:17:06,083
See! We were talking
about this photo.

1207
01:17:06,333 --> 01:17:07,458
Right, Appu Sir?

1208
01:17:08,458 --> 01:17:09,583
Look at it!

1209
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:12,416
This picture brings back all the
wild memories from that crazy night!

1210
01:17:12,583 --> 01:17:13,583
Crazy!

1211
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:15,875
Good old days, right?

1212
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Okay, then.

1213
01:17:19,041 --> 01:17:20,250
I'm leaving.

1214
01:17:20,375 --> 01:17:22,416
I need to take care of
some work on my way there.

1215
01:17:23,291 --> 01:17:24,416
Shall I leave, Ji?

1216
01:17:24,583 --> 01:17:26,791
I plan to come to the
estate again next month.

1217
01:17:26,833 --> 01:17:28,458
If time permits,
we'll definitely meet.

1218
01:17:29,375 --> 01:17:30,541
See you that time.

1219
01:17:30,625 --> 01:17:31,666
Take care.

1220
01:17:31,708 --> 01:17:32,708
Bye.

1221
01:17:32,958 --> 01:17:34,333
- See you.
- I'll just see him out.

1222
01:17:55,291 --> 01:17:56,708
So what happened, Prakashetta?

1223
01:17:57,666 --> 01:17:59,291
- Is he the photographer?
- Hi, I am Mukundan.

1224
01:17:59,333 --> 01:18:00,583
Show me the photo quickly.

1225
01:18:00,583 --> 01:18:01,791
Show it to him.

1226
01:18:04,416 --> 01:18:06,583
Shouldn't we inform
the police immediately?

1227
01:18:06,708 --> 01:18:08,500
Let me see it first, Prakashetta.

1228
01:18:10,458 --> 01:18:11,500
Sir...

1229
01:18:18,375 --> 01:18:21,375
The tribal colony boundary
starts from the 13th block.

1230
01:18:24,375 --> 01:18:26,791
- The news coming from
Kallepathi Reserve Forest

1231
01:18:26,833 --> 01:18:29,375
- evokes surprise and an
increased sense of fear.

1232
01:18:29,416 --> 01:18:31,625
The picture of a monkey holding a pistol...

1233
01:18:31,666 --> 01:18:33,500
If it has fallen down,
it can be retrieved.

1234
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,416
Rapid Response Team is
searching the entire area.

1235
01:18:35,416 --> 01:18:38,916
- Neither the Thunderbolt team
nor the police found any clues

1236
01:18:38,916 --> 01:18:42,791
- about the suspected weapons training
incident that happened months ago.

1237
01:18:42,833 --> 01:18:45,041
Do you have any idea
which direction they went?

1238
01:18:45,458 --> 01:18:46,750
It's a forest, right, Sir?

1239
01:18:46,791 --> 01:18:48,583
We couldn't tell which
direction they went.

1240
01:18:48,625 --> 01:18:50,750
Naxal movements have
previously been reported

1241
01:18:50,791 --> 01:18:52,291
in the tribal colonies
beyond the 13th block.

1242
01:18:52,291 --> 01:18:54,333
What if the monkeys got it
from one of their camps?

1243
01:18:54,333 --> 01:18:55,625
Isn't it Axle wood tree?

1244
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:58,250
Look! Isn't it an Axle wood tree?

1245
01:18:58,708 --> 01:18:59,916
In the Kallepathi area,

1246
01:18:59,916 --> 01:19:02,583
Axle wood trees are found only
beyond the 20th and 21st blocks.

1247
01:19:02,625 --> 01:19:05,791
Your request for photography
and the permission we granted

1248
01:19:05,833 --> 01:19:07,958
was limited to visiting only
the 18th and 19th blocks.

1249
01:19:07,958 --> 01:19:10,500
You can't just roam around
the forest however you want!

1250
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,291
Easy, Aravindetta.

1251
01:19:12,708 --> 01:19:14,916
We got to know this because
they roamed around, right?

1252
01:19:22,916 --> 01:19:25,333
Issue Section 144 in
Kallepathi Subdivision.

1253
01:19:25,875 --> 01:19:28,500
It's been decided to close
the tribal school for a week.

1254
01:19:28,541 --> 01:19:31,250
- Okay, Sir.
- And tourist permission is a definite no.

1255
01:19:31,291 --> 01:19:33,875
You should go and inform
the colonies directly.

1256
01:19:34,083 --> 01:19:35,791
- Take Prakashettan along with you.
- Okay.

1257
01:19:38,958 --> 01:19:42,125
Shouldn't we cross-check this with
Appu Pillai's fire-arm missing case?

1258
01:19:51,541 --> 01:19:53,333
If it's proved that
it is Dad's gun,

1259
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:55,166
we are in for
double the trouble.

1260
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:59,333
They might file a case for
failing to secure the possession.

1261
01:20:02,125 --> 01:20:03,958
And if there are any
casualties due to the gun,

1262
01:20:04,375 --> 01:20:05,916
it will be a tough
knot to untie.

1263
01:20:06,208 --> 01:20:08,375
But we can just say that
it's not ours, can't we?

1264
01:20:08,958 --> 01:20:10,750
Dad must be aware of
the legal side, right?

1265
01:20:26,625 --> 01:20:27,625
Sir.

1266
01:20:27,708 --> 01:20:29,375
Appu Pillai has confirmed the pistol.

1267
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:31,125
But...

1268
01:20:31,208 --> 01:20:33,250
he can confirm only the
model description, right?

1269
01:20:33,416 --> 01:20:35,083
How can he be sure
that it is his gun?

1270
01:20:35,250 --> 01:20:37,250
Among all the license
holders in Revenue records,

1271
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:39,041
only Appu Pillai has
a gun with this spec.

1272
01:20:39,125 --> 01:20:40,250
Which is this gun?

1273
01:20:40,291 --> 01:20:41,541
Shield EZ series.

1274
01:20:41,791 --> 01:20:43,166
- Smith & Wesson?
- Yes.

1275
01:20:43,166 --> 01:20:44,500
Is it available here?

1276
01:20:44,583 --> 01:20:47,083
He had qualified for the National
Shooting Meet in the past.

1277
01:20:47,208 --> 01:20:49,000
So, he has the
privilege to import it.

1278
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:52,083
Like I said before, I feel
this could be a fake gun.

1279
01:20:52,291 --> 01:20:53,958
It could even be a toy gun.

1280
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,125
It could be.

1281
01:20:55,708 --> 01:20:57,958
But the issue here
is public threat,

1282
01:20:58,875 --> 01:21:00,750
either until we
recover that gun,

1283
01:21:01,208 --> 01:21:03,250
or until we get a
closer look at it.

1284
01:21:03,791 --> 01:21:06,708
So, we can't take a chance
based on that assumption.

1285
01:21:08,208 --> 01:21:11,750
We can give a petition to suspend
Appu Pillai's gun licence.

1286
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,166
Notify the Collector's office
and the Superintendent.

1287
01:21:14,208 --> 01:21:15,208
Sir.

1288
01:21:15,291 --> 01:21:16,541
Start the follow-up inquiry.

1289
01:21:16,583 --> 01:21:17,583
Okay, Sir.

1290
01:22:41,625 --> 01:22:42,666
Dad...

1291
01:22:53,291 --> 01:22:54,375
Dad!

1292
01:22:56,708 --> 01:22:58,041
Let go of me, Dad!

1293
01:22:58,083 --> 01:22:59,250
Let go of my hand, Dad!

1294
01:22:59,291 --> 01:23:00,458
- What are you doing?
- Hey!

1295
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,083
Dad!

1296
01:23:02,208 --> 01:23:03,458
Move away, Dad!

1297
01:23:04,125 --> 01:23:05,666
Hey! What are you--
Dad!

1298
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:07,083
What the hell are you doing?

1299
01:23:07,208 --> 01:23:08,541
- Leave me, Dad!
- Move!

1300
01:23:11,041 --> 01:23:12,166
Dad!

1301
01:23:13,958 --> 01:23:15,500
Dad... Get up.

1302
01:23:18,125 --> 01:23:19,333
Get up.

1303
01:23:24,458 --> 01:23:25,583
What is this?

1304
01:23:25,708 --> 01:23:27,125
What happened?

1305
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,333
- Ajayetta.. that...
- Hey!

1306
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:34,500
What are you doing?

1307
01:23:34,541 --> 01:23:36,541
It's Dad who's burning stuff here.
I saw it!

1308
01:23:36,583 --> 01:23:37,916
- What did you see?

1309
01:23:38,208 --> 01:23:39,833
- Why should he do that here?

1310
01:23:39,958 --> 01:23:41,250
- It's not me, Ajayetta!
- Then?

1311
01:23:41,291 --> 01:23:42,458
Ajayan...

1312
01:23:43,083 --> 01:23:45,791
If there is a problem
between you two,

1313
01:23:45,916 --> 01:23:47,708
resolve it in your room.

1314
01:23:49,125 --> 01:23:52,416
Don't give the townsfolk
any reason to gossip.

1315
01:23:55,291 --> 01:23:56,291
Huh?

1316
01:23:57,416 --> 01:23:58,416
Oh...

1317
01:24:14,583 --> 01:24:15,625
Have you had enough?

1318
01:24:18,958 --> 01:24:20,666
Dad is planning something, Ajayetta.

1319
01:24:22,083 --> 01:24:23,708
Okay... Say it.

1320
01:24:23,833 --> 01:24:25,750
There are already a hundred
stories about him in town.

1321
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:27,333
Now you can start one
from home as well.

1322
01:24:27,958 --> 01:24:31,500
Like all of you, I can't think
rationally all of a sudden.

1323
01:24:31,916 --> 01:24:34,291
For everyone else, Appu Pillai
is just a curious character.

1324
01:24:35,291 --> 01:24:36,666
But to me, he is my father!

1325
01:25:16,708 --> 01:25:18,083
Okay. Let me see.

1326
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:33,333
If you want tea or coffee,
we can provide it. Okay?

1327
01:25:35,333 --> 01:25:36,666
This may take some time.

1328
01:25:39,666 --> 01:25:44,000
We spoke to Sumadathan,
the watcher, in the morning.

1329
01:25:44,416 --> 01:25:48,333
There are certain things that
only the two of you know, right?

1330
01:25:48,541 --> 01:25:50,000
You are old friends, aren't you?

1331
01:25:54,416 --> 01:25:56,541
- Hey, this is going
beyond what we thought.

1332
01:25:57,291 --> 01:25:59,916
Since morning, they've been digging
into Pillai Chettan's history

1333
01:25:59,958 --> 01:26:01,750
to connect it with
the current issue.

1334
01:26:02,166 --> 01:26:05,375
- If we had clarity on what
Suman Chettan told them,

1335
01:26:06,041 --> 01:26:08,625
- it would have been easier
for us to deal with it.

1336
01:26:21,708 --> 01:26:23,833
Third week of March, 2021.

1337
01:26:24,750 --> 01:26:27,833
During that time, a monkey
was shot and killed...

1338
01:26:28,083 --> 01:26:29,208
on your property.

1339
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:33,291
Evidence from the monkey's
remains found in Joy's property

1340
01:26:33,625 --> 01:26:36,375
matches the specifications
of your pistol.

1341
01:26:37,583 --> 01:26:40,333
In the witness statement given
by Sumadathan, the watcher,

1342
01:26:40,541 --> 01:26:42,583
there is an explanation for this incident.

1343
01:26:43,625 --> 01:26:47,916
But he doesn't know what happened
to the pistol after that.

1344
01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:50,833
That is missing in his story as well.

1345
01:27:02,125 --> 01:27:03,791
That day, I decided to meet Pillai

1346
01:27:03,833 --> 01:27:06,791
on my way back from the
Range Officer's quarters.

1347
01:27:10,916 --> 01:27:12,583
- Mumma!
- I'll show you today!

1348
01:27:12,583 --> 01:27:14,541
- Mumma!
- I'll whack you!

1349
01:27:14,541 --> 01:27:15,666
- Grandpa!

1350
01:27:15,708 --> 01:27:17,250
- I'll peel your skin off!

1351
01:27:17,291 --> 01:27:18,416
- Grandpa!

1352
01:27:18,416 --> 01:27:19,500
- I'll show you who I am!

1353
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:21,166
- Please don't beat me!
- Move this way!

1354
01:27:22,041 --> 01:27:24,625
- I will show you--
- Stop it! Please stop it!

1355
01:27:24,666 --> 01:27:26,541
If we keep giving him a pass
just because he's a kid,

1356
01:27:26,541 --> 01:27:28,458
this brat will burn the
house down in the future!

1357
01:27:28,458 --> 01:27:30,750
- Look at the way he stares!
- Hey, hey!

1358
01:27:31,458 --> 01:27:32,750
Isn't he just a child?

1359
01:27:32,791 --> 01:27:34,000
Yeah, right! Just a child!

1360
01:27:34,291 --> 01:27:36,958
He took this gun out
from my locked box

1361
01:27:37,166 --> 01:27:39,250
So, this imp knows how
to steal, right?

1362
01:27:39,250 --> 01:27:41,416
And he took the cartridge
that was stored away,

1363
01:27:41,625 --> 01:27:43,750
disabled the trigger
lock and fired!

1364
01:27:44,333 --> 01:27:45,916
Now, can we really
call him a child?

1365
01:27:46,375 --> 01:27:48,833
If any mishap happens with this gun,
I'm the one who's answerable!

1366
01:27:48,833 --> 01:27:50,041
What is this, son?

1367
01:27:50,083 --> 01:27:51,458
Let his parents come!

1368
01:27:51,583 --> 01:27:52,833
Aren't they here?

1369
01:27:52,833 --> 01:27:55,041
Oh! They can leave him
here and go anywhere, right?

1370
01:27:55,916 --> 01:27:57,916
Why even have kids if you
can't take care of them?

1371
01:27:58,083 --> 01:27:59,208
Let them come back!

1372
01:27:59,708 --> 01:28:01,708
Or they could send him
to a boarding school

1373
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:03,500
until his mom's treatment
is complete.

1374
01:28:03,541 --> 01:28:04,750
We will look into it.

1375
01:28:04,791 --> 01:28:06,125
Calm down now.

1376
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,083
If word gets out, this will
be a serious police case.

1377
01:28:55,208 --> 01:28:56,458
You are not diabetic, right?

1378
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:57,791
Today is Chachu's birthday.

1379
01:29:12,708 --> 01:29:13,958
Do you want dessert, Chachu?

1380
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,000
No.

1381
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:20,958
When he behaved like
nothing had happened,

1382
01:29:21,166 --> 01:29:22,958
I found it strange at first.

1383
01:29:23,833 --> 01:29:27,041
Then I felt that it must be his
way of dealing with such things.

1384
01:29:27,541 --> 01:29:30,125
And later, when did you
realize it wasn't like that?

1385
01:29:30,708 --> 01:29:33,875
He came to me when he
realized the gun was missing.

1386
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:35,916
That is what he told me.

1387
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:40,458
He asked me to tell him everything
I remember from that evening.

1388
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:43,666
Then he started
visiting me often.

1389
01:29:43,833 --> 01:29:45,791
He also asked me
about past events.

1390
01:29:45,958 --> 01:29:48,291
The comrades from the Nilambur
incident and the police case

1391
01:29:48,333 --> 01:29:49,833
would all come up
in the discussion.

1392
01:29:50,375 --> 01:29:52,875
He went and met
some of them as well.

1393
01:29:54,375 --> 01:29:55,916
Every time he comes here,

1394
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,291
he asks the same questions,

1395
01:29:57,291 --> 01:29:58,708
and I give the same answers.

1396
01:29:59,041 --> 01:30:02,625
He listens to them like he's hearing them
for the first time, every single time.

1397
01:30:03,791 --> 01:30:05,666
And you've never asked
him anything about it?

1398
01:30:06,166 --> 01:30:07,416
I asked him once.

1399
01:30:08,166 --> 01:30:09,958
He got angry and stormed out.

1400
01:30:10,916 --> 01:30:12,958
If he isn't telling me something,

1401
01:30:13,208 --> 01:30:15,125
it means he doesn't want
me to know about it.

1402
01:30:16,708 --> 01:30:17,708
This...

1403
01:30:18,333 --> 01:30:19,791
gunfire at Kallepathi...

1404
01:30:21,166 --> 01:30:23,125
The gun found in
the monkey's hand...

1405
01:30:24,250 --> 01:30:25,875
Does Dad have any
connection to those?

1406
01:30:28,333 --> 01:30:31,041
This shows how little knowledge
sons have about their fathers!

1407
01:30:37,291 --> 01:30:39,125
You know what I think?

1408
01:30:39,375 --> 01:30:42,500
It wasn't during
this election season,

1409
01:30:42,541 --> 01:30:44,750
that you noticed
your gun was missing.

1410
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:47,375
But you didn't inform anyone.

1411
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:54,000
When you didn't inform
anyone, it means...

1412
01:30:54,875 --> 01:30:58,291
there is something you
don't want anyone to know.

1413
01:30:59,041 --> 01:31:00,041
Right?

1414
01:31:34,375 --> 01:31:35,416
Hello?

1415
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:37,541
Ajayan, what is the
current situation?

1416
01:31:37,625 --> 01:31:40,625
They're saying that they
just want to talk to him.

1417
01:31:41,208 --> 01:31:42,583
What does 'just' talking mean?

1418
01:31:42,833 --> 01:31:44,541
There is a limit for everything, right?

1419
01:31:44,583 --> 01:31:47,750
Just like your dad, if you insist
on keeping his illness a secret...

1420
01:31:47,833 --> 01:31:49,250
You know his routines, right?

1421
01:31:50,041 --> 01:31:51,291
If he encounters a block,

1422
01:31:51,333 --> 01:31:52,500
he will panic.

1423
01:31:52,666 --> 01:31:53,958
No doubt about it.

1424
01:32:13,875 --> 01:32:15,583
How can you detain an
elderly person like this?

1425
01:32:15,625 --> 01:32:17,041
It's a department
matter, Ajayan.

1426
01:32:17,083 --> 01:32:18,916
I'm also working in the
same department, right?

1427
01:32:19,083 --> 01:32:21,375
Don't just settle for this.
Check if there is scope for UAPA as well.

1428
01:32:21,833 --> 01:32:24,458
I guess the mighty CBI would come
to investigate a dead monkey!

1429
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:25,083
Ajayan!

1430
01:32:25,125 --> 01:32:27,291
You just want to connect that
monkey to Dad's pistol somehow.

1431
01:32:27,291 --> 01:32:30,958
Only then can you link that gunfire
case to the Naxal activity, right?

1432
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,208
Let me explain! Come!

1433
01:32:32,416 --> 01:32:34,458
Hey, it's okay. They just want
to get your dad's statement.

1434
01:32:34,458 --> 01:32:35,583
Yeah, right!
What statement?

1435
01:32:35,625 --> 01:32:37,625
If you behave like this,
it will hurt their ego.

1436
01:32:38,916 --> 01:32:39,958
You tell me then.

1437
01:32:39,958 --> 01:32:42,375
Who is so hell-bent on forcing
a Naxal connection upon Dad?

1438
01:32:42,833 --> 01:32:44,208
Don't react without
knowing the facts.

1439
01:32:44,208 --> 01:32:45,083
Why shouldn't I react?

1440
01:32:45,125 --> 01:32:46,750
You can react, but not
like however you please.

1441
01:32:46,791 --> 01:32:49,833
Chetta, the person sitting inside
isn't normal like you or me.

1442
01:32:50,875 --> 01:32:53,750
You're aware of Dad's health
issues to some extent, right?

1443
01:32:54,416 --> 01:32:57,708
Can we tell how they will
treat such a person, Chetta?

1444
01:33:06,583 --> 01:33:09,750
[Same day? ... March 19-3-2021...
Should find out Chachu's missing... ]

1445
01:33:13,791 --> 01:33:16,500

1447
01:33:22,625 --> 01:33:23,708
Pistol...

1448
01:33:57,833 --> 01:34:00,500
There is no point in
sitting mute like this.

1449
01:34:15,416 --> 01:34:17,500
I'll have to talk to his family.

1450
01:34:17,625 --> 01:34:18,625
Okay.

1451
01:35:08,458 --> 01:35:09,875
I will take care of it.

1452
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:18,750
Sir.

1453
01:35:33,250 --> 01:35:34,833
Can't really call it a treatment.

1454
01:35:35,041 --> 01:35:36,666
A kind of reminiscence therapy.

1455
01:35:37,166 --> 01:35:38,875
We must encourage the patient,

1456
01:35:38,875 --> 01:35:40,375
to talk or to think.

1457
01:35:40,458 --> 01:35:43,083
A casual conversation, like the
ones friends have, would be enough.

1458
01:35:43,125 --> 01:35:44,916
That will stimulate their brain activity.

1459
01:35:45,666 --> 01:35:46,833
Socializing skills,

1460
01:35:46,875 --> 01:35:49,333
self-esteem, attention, and confidence.

1461
01:35:49,375 --> 01:35:51,125
It can help boost everything.

1462
01:35:51,666 --> 01:35:55,125
Also, it's a way to know if
his condition is getting worse.

1463
01:35:56,125 --> 01:35:58,375
Has it been a long time
since you began this therapy?

1464
01:35:58,625 --> 01:35:59,958
It's been going
on for some time.

1465
01:36:00,291 --> 01:36:01,666
Once every two months, right?

1466
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,041
Yes.

1467
01:36:03,041 --> 01:36:04,416
Does Appu Pillai know...

1468
01:36:04,708 --> 01:36:07,000
that your visits are actually
therapy sessions, Doctor?

1469
01:36:07,250 --> 01:36:08,958
No. I haven't told him.

1470
01:36:09,416 --> 01:36:12,791
If he finds out, we can't say how
far he'd be willing to cooperate.

1471
01:36:13,708 --> 01:36:16,166
Even I go there disguised
as an old friend,

1472
01:36:16,625 --> 01:36:18,458
obviously, with his
help and consent.

1473
01:36:18,833 --> 01:36:20,666
We act like we don't
know anything either.

1474
01:36:21,875 --> 01:36:24,458
I tried hinting it to Dad
a couple of times.

1475
01:36:24,958 --> 01:36:27,208
But every time, he got upset.

1476
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,458
Then he starts to panic.

1477
01:36:30,166 --> 01:36:31,458
If he panics,

1478
01:36:31,583 --> 01:36:33,416
he may lose hold of reality.

1479
01:36:33,916 --> 01:36:35,375
For remembering things,

1480
01:36:35,458 --> 01:36:37,458
Dad has his own set of
habits and routines.

1481
01:36:39,333 --> 01:36:40,875
The longer he's held here,

1482
01:36:41,333 --> 01:36:43,208
the more those routines
are being broken, Sir.

1483
01:36:43,333 --> 01:36:48,083
This is a copy of Dad's certificate from
the Termination Medical Examination.

1484
01:36:52,166 --> 01:36:54,083
If the situation here
continues to drag on,

1485
01:36:54,250 --> 01:36:56,208
we will have to file
these papers in court.

1486
01:36:57,375 --> 01:37:00,458
This is enough to show that my dad's
not in any condition to deal with this.

1487
01:37:01,250 --> 01:37:03,500
If possible, we would prefer
to avoid such a scene.

1488
01:37:03,750 --> 01:37:07,000
Dad wouldn't want the world
to know about his condition

1489
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,875
and the past events
from his army service.

1490
01:37:09,750 --> 01:37:10,958
Excuse me.

1491
01:37:22,291 --> 01:37:23,291
Ah!

1492
01:37:25,333 --> 01:37:26,333
Any progress?

1493
01:37:28,833 --> 01:37:30,958
This will come back and
screw us in a big way!

1494
01:37:31,583 --> 01:37:33,250
- Huh?
- Not just the Police,

1495
01:37:33,375 --> 01:37:35,291
Revenue, Forest - all
will have a hard time.

1496
01:37:35,708 --> 01:37:36,833
What happened?

1497
01:37:38,916 --> 01:37:41,000
Weren't you the Station
House Officer here

1498
01:37:41,208 --> 01:37:43,500
when Appu Pillai's gun
license verification was done?

1499
01:37:43,875 --> 01:37:44,916
Yes.

1500
01:37:44,958 --> 01:37:46,333
How long ago was that?

1501
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:48,583
Around eight years ago.

1502
01:37:52,333 --> 01:37:54,916
Appu Pillai was terminated
from the Army

1503
01:37:54,958 --> 01:37:56,416
because he was
mentally unstable,

1504
01:37:56,916 --> 01:37:58,375
16 years ago!

1505
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:02,291
We will be answerable for this!

1506
01:38:03,041 --> 01:38:04,250
The court will only ask

1507
01:38:04,291 --> 01:38:07,250
how we allowed someone mentally
unstable to pass the verification

1508
01:38:07,291 --> 01:38:08,750
and be granted a gun license!

1509
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:11,916
Furthermore, since
we're trying to say

1510
01:38:12,625 --> 01:38:15,083
that the pistol found in the
monkey's hand belongs to him,

1511
01:38:15,875 --> 01:38:17,375
it is bonus-risk for us.

1512
01:38:19,208 --> 01:38:20,750
It's a public threat issue.

1513
01:38:34,083 --> 01:38:35,541
They will release Dad right away.

1514
01:38:35,666 --> 01:38:36,791
Oh!

1515
01:38:36,833 --> 01:38:38,833
As per the medical
certificate we provided,

1516
01:38:39,041 --> 01:38:42,250
Dad was not eligible for a gun license
during the time of verification.

1517
01:38:42,625 --> 01:38:45,083
So, if his memory problem gets revealed...

1518
01:38:45,333 --> 01:38:46,541
They all suck!

1519
01:38:46,750 --> 01:38:50,208
So, they've got more at stake
in hiding it than we do, right?

1520
01:38:50,250 --> 01:38:51,250
Yes.

1521
01:38:51,375 --> 01:38:52,583

the notes he's written
and stored safely, right??

1547
01:41:32,708 --> 01:41:35,291
He must have panicked seeing
them scattered everywhere.

1548
01:41:36,166 --> 01:41:38,833
Would someone who writes
everything down to remember

1549

really try to burn all of it themselves?

âHow many times did Chachu
fire at the monkey?â

1563

01:42:39,666 --> 01:42:40,666
Err...

1566
01:42:51,333 --> 01:42:53,666
You started playing Sherlock Holmes
from the day you arrived here!

1567
01:42:53,708 --> 01:42:55,708
You too want to portray
my dad as a culprit.

1568
01:42:56,125 --> 01:42:58,166
For that, you keep coming up
with findings and theories.

1569
01:42:58,166 --> 01:43:00,250
If you haven't had enough,
go ahead and do a postmortem on him too!

1570
01:43:06,958 --> 01:43:08,708
I found this from Dad's room.

1571
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,666
Identifying the gun in the monkey's
hands from the photo as his

1572
01:43:14,250 --> 01:43:16,500
could be viewed as him taking
advantage of the situation.

1573
01:43:16,583 --> 01:43:18,833
That way, the gun missing
case will have a conclusion.

1574
01:43:19,166 --> 01:43:22,291
But why should he deliberately hide
it and then lie that it's missing?

1575
01:43:38,208 --> 01:43:40,041
I haven't come here on
a vacation, Ajayetta.

1576
01:43:41,166 --> 01:43:43,125
I'm not really sure how
you feel about it either.

1577
01:43:44,833 --> 01:43:46,625
But I believe I belong here.

1578
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,458
The people here and their problems
belong to me as well.

1579
01:43:51,750 --> 01:43:53,041
That includes Chachu too.

1580
01:43:56,125 --> 01:43:57,875
I've never seen him.
That's true.

1581
01:43:58,291 --> 01:44:00,833
If you ask me, I have no apparent
connection with him either.

1582
01:44:02,166 --> 01:44:05,166
But he's someone who should
have been here with you, right?

1583
01:44:09,041 --> 01:44:11,666
Though I've only been here a
short while, even I have felt...

1584
01:44:13,083 --> 01:44:14,375
that he should be here.

1585
01:44:15,583 --> 01:44:17,500
At least, we need to know
what happened to him.

1586
01:44:25,875 --> 01:44:26,875
Sorry.

1587
01:44:28,291 --> 01:44:30,458
When I saw Dad in such a
condition all of a sudden...

1588
01:44:31,625 --> 01:44:32,916
Your doubts...

1589
01:44:36,250 --> 01:44:37,708
What do you want me to ask him?

1590
01:44:39,791 --> 01:44:41,333
It's my father
we're talking about!

1591
01:44:50,208 --> 01:44:52,333
I'm not asking you to
view anyone as a villain.

1592
01:44:53,625 --> 01:44:55,125
But at least for some time,

1593
01:44:55,166 --> 01:44:57,625
think about it only
as Chachu's father.

1594
01:45:02,125 --> 01:45:04,916
In a way, Dad's current condition is
rather convenient for him, right?

1595
01:45:05,958 --> 01:45:09,208
He's the only one who knows what
he remembers or has forgotten.

1596
01:45:10,041 --> 01:45:11,541
He can pretend however
he likes, right?

1597
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,250
He could claim not to know
things he actually does,

1598
01:45:15,791 --> 01:45:18,208
and act like he's forgotten
things he's hiding.

1599
01:45:19,208 --> 01:45:21,833
No one would ever find
out or ask him about it.

1600
01:45:23,791 --> 01:45:25,041
As written here,

1601
01:45:25,083 --> 01:45:26,958
Dad's pistol is
missing two bullets.

1602
01:45:27,333 --> 01:45:29,666
He must have started
this "gun missing" drama

1603
01:45:29,708 --> 01:45:31,791
to dodge questions about
where the bullets went.

1604
01:45:32,375 --> 01:45:35,166
He must be burning these papers
to cover something up, right?

1605
01:45:35,875 --> 01:45:39,333
I'm just asking if they hold the
answer to what happened to Chachu.

1606
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:40,708
Enough!

1607
01:45:45,833 --> 01:45:47,708
Even Dad has got the
same questions as you.

1608
01:45:49,875 --> 01:45:52,125
He's also trying to figure
out what happened to Chachu.

1609
01:45:58,916 --> 01:45:59,958
But...

1610
01:46:02,791 --> 01:46:06,166
Without knowing where to
begin or whom to ask,

1611
01:46:07,791 --> 01:46:09,375
he keeps going to
Chachu's school,

1612
01:46:10,291 --> 01:46:11,916
and places where
Chachu had been to...

1613
01:46:13,625 --> 01:46:14,833
And...

1614
01:46:14,875 --> 01:46:16,041
to know...

1615
01:46:17,458 --> 01:46:19,708
if it's because of
something from his past,

1616
01:46:20,708 --> 01:46:22,000
he's been digging into that too.

1617
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,875
[Boy wasn't found from
Coimbatore either]

1618
01:46:25,833 --> 01:46:28,916
What he's been asking and
trying to understand from others

1619
01:46:30,125 --> 01:46:31,416
is actually about himself.

1620
01:46:33,958 --> 01:46:35,875
Even he is suspecting himself.

1621
01:46:39,833 --> 01:46:41,666
Trying to figure out if
he made any mistakes,

1622
01:46:43,416 --> 01:46:45,333
if he's forgotten
those mistakes,

1623
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:50,666
or if he's the reason behind
Chachu's disappearance.

1624
01:46:58,166 --> 01:47:02,000
He's been making all these notes
as part of his investigation.

1625
01:47:04,291 --> 01:47:05,583
And he's burning them,

1626
01:47:06,125 --> 01:47:07,458
to cover it up,

1627
01:47:09,708 --> 01:47:10,833
not from us,

1628
01:47:12,125 --> 01:47:13,375
but to make himself forget.

1629
01:47:14,666 --> 01:47:15,750
But...

1630
01:47:16,625 --> 01:47:18,083
once he forgets what he's done,

1631
01:47:20,250 --> 01:47:21,916
he starts the investigation
all over again.

1632
01:47:29,166 --> 01:47:30,416
Again and again...

1633
01:47:34,750 --> 01:47:35,958
Every single time...

1634
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:39,125
As if he's doing it
for the first time...

1635
01:47:47,458 --> 01:47:49,041
Every time he comes here,

1636
01:47:49,125 --> 01:47:50,416
he asks the same questions,

1637
01:47:50,458 --> 01:47:51,833
and I give the same answers.

1638
01:47:52,166 --> 01:47:55,750
He listens to them like he's hearing them
for the first time, every single time.

1639
01:47:56,291 --> 01:47:59,500
Those might be things he
prefers not to remember,

1640
01:48:00,250 --> 01:48:02,583
like an escape from the actual reality.

1641
01:48:05,375 --> 01:48:06,916
I'll whack you!

1642
01:48:06,958 --> 01:48:08,083
Grandpa...

1643
01:48:16,916 --> 01:48:18,666
So, would he have
solved it already?

1644
01:48:26,041 --> 01:48:27,708
When did Chachu
actually go missing?

1645
01:48:29,083 --> 01:48:32,333
You had told me that it was on the day
you took Praveena Chechi to the hospital.

1646
01:48:35,708 --> 01:48:37,083
It was Chachu's birthday.

1647
01:48:39,250 --> 01:48:40,583
That was on March 19th.

1648
01:48:44,583 --> 01:48:45,791
I'll be right back.

1649
01:48:45,833 --> 01:48:48,458
If I fill the form now, I can go
to the site directly tomorrow.

1650
01:48:49,458 --> 01:48:50,666
Leave the phone to charge.

1651
01:48:56,791 --> 01:48:59,125
But as per the news
and police records,

1652
01:48:59,125 --> 01:49:01,000
the complaint about
him going missing...

1653
01:49:01,208 --> 01:49:03,416
was filed a day later,
on the night of 20th.

1654
01:49:07,166 --> 01:49:09,375
Is there anything you
haven't told me yet?

1655
01:49:31,791 --> 01:49:32,791
Pravi...

1656
01:49:34,916 --> 01:49:35,916
Chachu...

1657
01:49:46,958 --> 01:49:47,958
Cha...

1658
01:50:05,333 --> 01:50:06,375
Chachu...

1659
01:50:07,166 --> 01:50:08,208
Chachu..

1660
01:50:08,916 --> 01:50:09,916
My son...

1661
01:50:10,375 --> 01:50:11,416
Chachu...

1662
01:50:12,916 --> 01:50:13,958
Chachu...

1663
01:50:14,208 --> 01:50:15,250
Chachu...

1664
01:50:15,583 --> 01:50:16,625
Chachu...

1665
01:50:25,875 --> 01:50:26,875
My son!

1666
01:50:44,083 --> 01:50:45,083
What...

1667
01:50:45,083 --> 01:50:46,250
What happened?

1668
01:50:49,458 --> 01:50:50,458
Huh?

1669
01:50:51,083 --> 01:50:52,541
He... He...

1670
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:54,291
He...

1671
01:50:54,333 --> 01:50:55,708
was hiding it...

1672
01:50:55,875 --> 01:50:57,291
from me.

1673
01:50:57,541 --> 01:50:58,875
He didn't give it to me.

1674
01:51:02,166 --> 01:51:03,916
I was trying to grab
it back from him,

1675
01:51:03,958 --> 01:51:05,000
Ajayetta!!

1676
01:51:06,041 --> 01:51:06,791
He...

1677
01:51:06,791 --> 01:51:07,875
Don't act so stubborn.
Let go of it!

1678
01:51:07,916 --> 01:51:09,125
He was throwing tantrums...

1679
01:51:10,083 --> 01:51:11,250
He didn't give it to me.

1680
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,458
- Give it to me.
- No, I want it!

1681
01:51:15,125 --> 01:51:16,125
I...

1682
01:51:18,166 --> 01:51:20,000
I unknowingly...

1683
01:51:20,500 --> 01:51:21,833
I...

1684
01:51:21,958 --> 01:51:23,500
I want my son!

1685
01:51:27,333 --> 01:51:29,916
I want my son back, Ajayetta!

1686
01:52:08,083 --> 01:52:09,083
Dad...

1687
01:52:11,583 --> 01:52:13,375
If this is about seeing a
doctor, don't start again.

1688
01:52:13,375 --> 01:52:14,708
I've made it clear several times.

1689
01:52:15,833 --> 01:52:17,041
I'm perfectly alright.

1690
01:52:17,083 --> 01:52:18,416
I can take care of myself.

1691
01:52:54,833 --> 01:52:56,375
Pravi... Pravi...

1692
01:53:01,125 --> 01:53:02,291
Pravi...

1693
01:53:48,791 --> 01:53:50,083
Please wait outside.

1694
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:05,875
What happened to her?

1695
01:54:07,375 --> 01:54:09,083
It's a painkiller
overdose, Doctor.

1696
01:54:09,458 --> 01:54:12,708
Taking one or two more tablets than
necessary is called an overdose,

1697
01:54:12,750 --> 01:54:14,916
not feasting on them like rice.

1698
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Ma'am...

1699
01:54:16,458 --> 01:54:18,458
I'm going to report this
to the police anyway.

1700
01:54:18,541 --> 01:54:20,250
It's clear that it's
a suicide attempt.

1701
01:54:21,208 --> 01:54:22,208
Doctor...

1702
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:24,041
Doctor...

1703
01:54:24,166 --> 01:54:25,791
She did it by mistake.

1704
01:54:25,833 --> 01:54:27,333
Do you know what
medicine she took?

1705
01:54:27,625 --> 01:54:29,833
They are just normal
pain killers.

1706
01:54:30,041 --> 01:54:31,416
I need to see the prescription.

1707
01:54:31,708 --> 01:54:33,000
I have the prescription with me.

1708
01:54:33,583 --> 01:54:35,041
She is undergoing Chemotherapy.

1709
01:54:37,708 --> 01:54:39,666
At which hospital is she
undergoing Chemotherapy?

1710
01:54:39,750 --> 01:54:40,750
VMC Hospital.

1711
01:54:44,166 --> 01:54:46,833
Shouldn't you be handling
such patients more carefully?

1712
01:54:47,166 --> 01:54:48,250
Doctor...

1713
01:54:55,041 --> 01:54:57,333
You need to bring
Praveena's medical records,

1714
01:54:57,625 --> 01:54:59,166
including the chemo certificates.

1715
01:55:11,458 --> 01:55:12,750
Hello, Ajayetta.

1716
01:55:14,500 --> 01:55:15,750
Yes, Prashobh.

1717
01:55:15,833 --> 01:55:16,833
Where's Pravi?

1718
01:55:16,875 --> 01:55:18,041
She isn't answering my calls.

1719
01:55:21,333 --> 01:55:22,666
- Hey...
- Hello?

1720
01:55:22,750 --> 01:55:24,041
Are you outside, Ajayetta?

1721
01:55:25,333 --> 01:55:26,416
Yes, I am.

1722
01:55:26,875 --> 01:55:28,041
I'm driving.

1723
01:55:28,500 --> 01:55:30,000
Oh, okay.
It's alright then.

1724
01:55:30,041 --> 01:55:32,083
Just tell her that I called.
I'll call her tomorrow.

1725
01:55:33,041 --> 01:55:34,416
Okay, Chetta.
Bye.

1726
01:55:35,250 --> 01:55:36,250
Okay.

1727
01:57:01,791 --> 01:57:03,416
I didn't see you at
all the entire day.

1728
01:57:05,208 --> 01:57:06,708
You should ask Maniyan to come.

1729
01:57:07,208 --> 01:57:09,791
The branch of the mango tree is
pressing against the roof tiles.

1730
01:58:12,958 --> 01:58:16,000
I just wanted to know if something
happened to him because of me.

1731
01:58:19,166 --> 01:58:21,375
You shouldn't lie about
things that can't be fixed.

1732
01:58:25,833 --> 01:58:28,500
The two of you went to the Medical
College Hospital on March 19th.

1733
01:58:29,375 --> 01:58:32,708
The details of the chemo session
are on record at the hospital.

1734
01:58:34,125 --> 01:58:36,875
My pistol is missing
two bullets now.

1735
01:58:38,041 --> 01:58:42,250
I found out from Sumadathan
how one of them went missing.

1736
01:58:45,041 --> 01:58:46,416
Second bullet?

1737
01:58:52,916 --> 01:58:55,583
I don't know whose hands it
happened by, between the two of you,

1738
01:58:56,083 --> 01:58:57,416
and I'm not going to ask either.

1739
01:58:57,750 --> 01:58:59,458
Even if it was an accident,

1740
01:58:59,625 --> 01:59:01,458
they will still charge it as murder.

1741
01:59:01,875 --> 01:59:04,625
She doesn't have the strength
to endure another tragedy,

1742
01:59:08,125 --> 01:59:13,541
and I can't go on living,
seeing you as the culprit.

1743
01:59:17,291 --> 01:59:19,291
Truths that do no
good for anyone...

1744
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:21,708
Let them be reduced
to ashes, like this.

1745
01:59:23,041 --> 01:59:24,041
I know...

1746
01:59:24,541 --> 01:59:26,791
my illness is beyond recovery.

1747
01:59:27,041 --> 01:59:29,208
But now, I feel truly happy about it.

1748
01:59:30,041 --> 01:59:31,416
It's a kind of
freedom, isn't it?

1749
01:59:31,666 --> 01:59:34,666
The freedom to live only
in the reality we choose.

1750
01:59:52,666 --> 01:59:55,041
There's a question that has
haunted me since that night...

1751
01:59:55,083 --> 01:59:56,083
"Where is Chachu now?"

1752
01:59:56,791 --> 01:59:59,041
But I don't think I can
ever ask that to Dad.

1753
02:00:00,041 --> 02:00:01,250
Even if I ask him,

1754
02:00:01,666 --> 02:00:03,625
would he remember the answer?

1755
02:00:04,291 --> 02:00:05,333
I don't know.

1756
02:00:05,916 --> 02:00:07,291
In case he doesn't remember,

1757
02:00:07,625 --> 02:00:09,583
wouldn't it just serve
as a painful reminder?

1758
02:00:10,041 --> 02:00:11,416
As Dad said;

1759
02:00:11,791 --> 02:00:13,541
Truths that do no
good for anyone...

1760
02:00:55,750 --> 02:00:58,916
I've found myself with a few people who
are deeply concerned about each other.

1761
02:00:59,875 --> 02:01:01,166
It's not morality,

1762
02:01:01,166 --> 02:01:03,041
but concern that keeps
them together.

1763
02:01:04,875 --> 02:01:06,416
Today, I'm one of them too.

1764
02:01:12,208 --> 02:01:13,791
This journey is to Nagpur.

1765
02:01:14,750 --> 02:01:16,416
Both Ajayettan and I know...

1766
02:01:16,416 --> 02:01:18,500
it's not Chachu
we're going to see.

1767
02:01:19,750 --> 02:01:21,125
That's just how some things are.

1768
02:01:21,291 --> 02:01:23,125
We have to keep up the
act until the very end.

3
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:06,833
Here you go.

4
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:08,291
Thank you.

5
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:17,291
- Welcome, ma'am. Can I help you?
- I'd like some salt, please.

6
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:18,375
Just a moment, okay?

7
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,041
- Sir?
- Yes?

8
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:22,000
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

9
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:24,125
One, two,

10
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:28,000
and I'll add another piece of soap
for you for free.

11
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:30,125
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.

12
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:32,083
- Bye then.
- Have a good day.

13
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:33,416
What can I get for you?

14
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,125
Some coffee and sugar, please.

15
00:01:35,208 --> 00:01:36,625
Coffee and sugar.

16
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:38,500
Just a moment.

17
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:45,125
How many kilos?

18
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:48,791
Aren't you going to buy some?

19
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,833
To, get me another one!

20
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:51,916
Yes, sir!

21
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:57,666
Sir.

22
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,875
- I need soy sauce.
- Sure.

23
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,791
Welcome.

24
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:09,000
Hi, welcome to my shop.

25
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:32,208
BAKTI WIRATAMA HOSPITAL

26
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:45,666
Ni, I've got enough money for the surgery.

27
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,208
His kidneys will heal soon.

28
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:50,916
Oh, thank God.

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,541
Thank you, dear.

30
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:53,916
For Ardi,

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,500
I will do anything.

32
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:03,291
Ardi, everything will go smoothly.

33
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,375
You'll recover soon, okay?

34
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:07,458
Nurse, anesthesia.

35
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,708
Oh, you're awake.

36
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:44,000
Just a moment. I'll get the doctor.

37
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,375
Ardi.

38
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,208
Let me give you a checkup, okay?

39
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,500
Di, have you seen my wallet?

40
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,708
No, Mom.

41
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:50,916
Ardi?

42
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,458
Come on, put on your sandals. Come on.

43
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:55,833
You said we were going to go.

44
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:58,833
- Yes, come on, come on, come on.
- Hooray!

45
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:00,958
Come on.

46
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,291
Two weeks after surgery,

47
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,041
he's looking great, ma'am.

48
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,416
Thank God.

49
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,041
But there's something I want to ask about.

50
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:14,625
Ever since the surgery,
Ardi has been complaining about his eyes.

51
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,833
He says he keeps seeing shadows.

52
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:19,333
Shadows?

53
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,125
If you'd like,

54
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:24,833
I can write you a referral

55
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,125
and you can take him to an eye specialist.

56
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,833
Yes, please.

57
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,916
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.

58
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,833
What is it, dear?

59
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,333
My shoulders feel heavy.

60
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,625
You should rest.

61
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,750
Marni, let me do it.

62
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:27,083
- Have you gone to the doctor?
- Yes, he said there was no problem.

63
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,916
It may be because
Ardi keeps rubbing his eyes.

64
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,416
Di? Ardi?

65
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,458
Come on, get up, son.

66
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,750
Ardi, what is it?

67
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,833
- Ardi?
- Ardi!

68
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:54,958
There's...

69
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,291
- There's...
- What is it?

70
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,083
On top of you, there's a...

71
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,791
creepy woman!

72
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,416
Things like this can happen.

73
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,166
His third eye was opened
after the surgery.

74
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:34,041
He can see those who are invisible.

75
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:36,666
What he saw last night

76
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,000
followed you from the market.

77
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,208
I got rid of it.

78
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,791
Then what should we do?

79
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,166
It will be hard on Ardi
if he keeps on seeing things.

80
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,500
Listen.

81
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,666
I can't close his third eye,

82
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,875
but I can narrow down his view.

83
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,125
- Narrow down?
- Yes.

84
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:06,625
So he will only see those
who are willing to show themselves.

85
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,041
If they don't want to,

86
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,750
he won't be able to.

87
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,041
If that's the case,

88
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,666
I can help.

89
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,666
A piece of advice, though.

90
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,333
You should try to keep him away
from the market.

91
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:22,416
Why?

92
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,375
As a trading place,
there is bound to be fraud,

93
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,875
lies, cheating,

94
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,750
broken promises, and false oaths.

95
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,875
The worst place to be is the market.

96
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:34,958
At the market,

97
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,291
there is a world that no one wants to see.

98
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,541
Not to mention trades
allied with supernatural beings.

99
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,791
Polytheism.

100
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,500
There are deals with the devil and...

101
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,875
black magic.

102
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,000
What's the lesson today?

103
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,583
Mathematics.

104
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,375
- Mom.
- Ardi.

105
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,000
Hey, Arif!

106
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,083
My body needs more energy.

107
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,250
{\an8}Mom!

108
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,958
{\an8}Arif has already eaten three.

109
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:47,583
{\an8}Arif.

110
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,541
{\an8}Mbok, please fry some more!

111
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,708
{\an8}Gosh.

112
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,333
{\an8}You're saying you need more energy.

113
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,541
{\an8}For what? Playing soccer?

114
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,000
{\an8}Sheesh. He just wants to practice gamelan
for the school performance.

115
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,541
{\an8}Just practice at home.

116
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:04,833
{\an8}Dad got you a gamelan set, right?

117
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,041
{\an8}What?

118
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:09,708
{\an8}I want to help my friend
deal with apparitions.

119
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:12,083
{\an8}I'm serious, you know.

120
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,916
{\an8}Here, I got it from my friend.

121
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,500
{\an8}Do you think what is written here
is the same

122
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,625
{\an8}as what you saw?

123
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:23,500
{\an8}My friend said it's the same thing.

124
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,291
{\an8}Your friend is a know-it-all.

125
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,916
{\an8}Let me lock your mouth.

126
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,125
{\an8}What?

127
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,625
{\an8}Scaredy cat, scaredy cat!

128
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:36,083
{\an8}That's enough.

129
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,500
{\an8}Come on, kids, eat properly.

130
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:39,666
{\an8}Scaredy cat.

131
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:43,500
{\an8}Di, this is the last day
to pay for college, right?

132
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,375
{\an8}Oh, right, Mom.

133
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:47,541
{\an8}And...

134
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,416
{\an8}my pocket money?

135
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,666
{\an8}Stop by the market and ask your father.

136
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,666
{\an8}Mbok and I are going to your aunt's house.

137
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,375
{\an8}Your brother and sister have school.

138
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,791
{\an8}I know, but...

139
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,083
{\an8}Just make it quick.

140
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,625
{\an8}Don't look around.

141
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,208
- How much is it?
- How much?

142
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,333
- Sorry, just a second.
- It's okay.

143
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,875
Excuse me, sir.

144
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,875
Back off, back off.

145
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:43,916
{\an8}I'm sorry!

146
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,666
{\an8}Are you okay?

147
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,500
I don't need your help!

148
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,958
You little shit.

149
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:01,666
I'm so sorry, sir.

150
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,000
It's all right.

151
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,291
Don't worry about it.

152
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,500
He just hasn't moved on.

153
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:10,000
He lost his daughter two weeks ago.

154
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,958
- I see.
- Yes, yes.

155
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,833
Thank you. Excuse me.

156
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:19,750
Oh, Ardi?

157
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,458
Have you seen my father?

158
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:24,791
He's upstairs.

159
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:25,708
- Oh, right. Thank you.
- Okay.

160
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,583
- Excuse me.
- Yes, of course.

161
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,166
- Just a second.
- Okay.

162
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,708
Cipto, Cipto. Enough with this.

163
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,416
Don't be greedy!

164
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:39,208
God will take care of your wealth!

165
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:40,791
{\an8}I know that! I know!

166
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,500
{\an8}Just don't get involved.

167
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:43,791
{\an8}It's none of your business.

168
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,208
{\an8}You're so stubborn.

169
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,166
{\an8}Whatever then.

170
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,083
{\an8}Uncle.

171
00:14:58,458 --> 00:14:59,208
{\an8}Sardi!

172
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:01,666
{\an8}Dad.

173
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,166
{\an8}What happened, Dad?

174
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,166
{\an8}Nothing.

175
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,250
{\an8}How long is Uncle Sardi going to
hold a grudge against us?

176
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:17,166
{\an8}Will he live a peaceful life
if he keeps doing this?

177
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,458
{\an8}This is not your fault, Dad.

178
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,375
{\an8}Your shop is always busy.

179
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,833
{\an8}Your life is complete.

180
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,166
{\an8}Meanwhile, Uncle Sardi

181
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,041
{\an8}has lost his entire family.

182
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,625
{\an8}He barely has customers.

183
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,500
{\an8}He's living frugally.

184
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,625
{\an8}It makes sense that he's jealous, Dad.

185
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,583
{\an8}Enough. He's your mother's older brother.

186
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,083
{\an8}What brings you here?

187
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,833
I need money for my tuition, Dad.
Today is the last day to pay.

188
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,625
Just a second.

189
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,458
Okay, Dad.

190
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,458
{\an8}How much is it?

191
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:24,416
{\an8}I want to buy some sugar.

192
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,750
{\an8}I'll see you around then.

193
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,583
{\an8}Yes, take care!

194
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:28,833
{\an8}Bye.

195
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,958
I'm sorry.

196
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,500
It's okay.

197
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:09,833
{\an8}A little higher, please.

198
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:14,458
You knew you were going to the market,
and yet you didn't eat much.

199
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:17,791
You lost your energy
because they sucked it out of you.

200
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,375
- Thank you.
- You're such a know-it-all.

201
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,250
I do know it all.

202
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,291
What did you see there?

203
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:28,041
A lot, right?
Did you see the real store owners?

204
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,250
What do you mean?

205
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,625
All places have real owners.

206
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,666
You don't believe it?

207
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,750
Have you ever heard of
the Queen of the South?

208
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:39,125
The ruler of the coast in southern Java?

209
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,625
If you go there wearing green clothes,

210
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,583
the waves will snatch you away.

211
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:47,083
Ardi?

212
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:50,958
Do you think the Queen is good or evil?

213
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,125
Ardi!

214
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,583
- He bit my hand!
- That's enough.

215
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,541
It hurts, Arif!

216
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,458
Arif, Syifa, go to sleep!

217
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:03,708
It's late!

218
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,250
Ardi, they say that
if your brother has a sixth sense,

219
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,000
then his siblings might have it too.

220
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,750
Who knows? Maybe Syifa can also see...

221
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,958
Yeesh, Arif!

222
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,250
Enough, enough.

223
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:20,583
I know that
having a sixth sense is not good.

224
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,666
It's just no good.

225
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:25,333
- Okay?
- Okay.

226
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:27,500
Now go to bed.

227
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,083
Hey!

228
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,458
Bring it on!

229
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,541
I'm not scared!

230
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,791
Dear?

231
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:38,583
Are you sick?

232
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,000
Just tired.

233
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,916
Let me give you a massage.

234
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:44,958
No need.

235
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:47,166
All right then.

236
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,708
I'll be in Syifa's room.

237
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,208
She's too scared to sleep alone.

238
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:30,583
With the seven rituals

239
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:33,500
at the seven points,

240
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:38,833
and with the sacrifice of body and soul...

241
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,041
Who are you?!

242
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,875
...one illness,

243
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:43,958
one grudge,

244
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:46,291
with their power from the ocean...

245
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:47,458
What are you doing to me?!

246
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:51,958
...I call you, soul-takers!

247
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,541
Suanggi!

248
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:54,916
Come!

249
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:57,916
Suanggi! Come!

250
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,791
Let me go!

251
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:02,541
You are mighty.

252
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:05,208
You are the predator.

253
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:09,916
Make this man and his family

254
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,791
all dead!

255
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:51,041
Tortured one by one!

256
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,166
Dear, have breakfast first.

257
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,666
Didn't you eat last night?

258
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:48,625
Eat first, Dad.

259
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,375
Take your medicine after.
Your body is hot.

260
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:06,125
Have a drink, Dad.

261
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,500
Dear?

262
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:21,916
- Dad?
- Dear?

263
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,833
- Dad?
- Dear?

264
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:25,000
- Dear!
- Dad!

265
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:26,916
- Dear!
- Dad?

266
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,791
- Dear?
- Dad?

267
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:29,833
Dad?

268
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:31,750
Dad! Dad! Dad!

269
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:34,500
- Dear!
- Dad.

270
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:35,333
Dad...

271
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:42,541
Dad. Dad?

272
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:44,000
Dad?

273
00:24:44,708 --> 00:24:45,458
Dad?

274
00:24:45,541 --> 00:24:46,625
- Dad!
- Dear!

275
00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:48,791
- Help him!
- Dad!

276
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,666
Wake up, Dad.

277
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,333
- Wake up, Dad.
- Mbok!

278
00:24:52,416 --> 00:24:53,791
Where is she?

279
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:56,875
Mbok!

280
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:06,958
Dad. Dad?

281
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:14,875
So far, there seem to be
no internal injuries.

282
00:25:15,916 --> 00:25:18,125
All vitals are in good condition.

283
00:25:18,666 --> 00:25:20,333
But to be sure,

284
00:25:20,416 --> 00:25:22,250
we need further observations.

285
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:26,458
Sir, we'll keep you here
for two more days, all right?

286
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:27,666
No need.

287
00:25:28,791 --> 00:25:29,625
Dear...

288
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:36,083
I just want to go home.

289
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:45,166
So, they still don't know
what your illness is?

290
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,500
If the doctor doesn't know,

291
00:25:46,583 --> 00:25:48,416
just go and see a psychic.

292
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,541
I don't need one.

293
00:25:51,916 --> 00:25:54,791
I'm just afraid that it's black magic.

294
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:58,208
Yes, your shop is the most popular.

295
00:25:58,291 --> 00:25:59,750
Someone will definitely be jealous.

296
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:01,500
Listen.

297
00:26:02,583 --> 00:26:04,291
I don't believe in witchcraft.

298
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:07,458
Excuse me, everyone.

299
00:26:07,541 --> 00:26:10,500
Let's just chat outside and let him rest.

300
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:12,125
- Yes.
- Of course.

301
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:13,333
Excuse us, sir.

302
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:15,833
Hope you get well soon.

303
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:25,416
EVIL OF THE UNSEEN

304
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:38,291
{\an8}CHAPTER V: BLACK MAGIC

305
00:26:40,916 --> 00:26:42,791
{\an8}"There are various types of black magic."

306
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:45,458
{\an8}"There is also black magic that is sent
using invisible creatures

307
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:47,166
{\an8}to injure and kill someone."

308
00:26:53,666 --> 00:26:55,375
Ardi, pick me up after sunset.

309
00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:56,625
Yes, Mom.

310
00:26:57,583 --> 00:26:59,125
- Sister?
- Brother.

311
00:27:00,041 --> 00:27:01,125
How is Cipto?

312
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:03,958
He's still weak.

313
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:06,833
- Are you looking after the shop?
- Yes.

314
00:27:07,541 --> 00:27:09,625
Okay. Here's some herbal medicine
for your husband.

315
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,500
Drink it once a day.

316
00:27:11,583 --> 00:27:12,916
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

317
00:27:13,958 --> 00:27:15,958
Ardi, it's for your dad.

318
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:18,875
- Take it home.
- Yes, Mom.

319
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:21,291
I'll see you again later.

320
00:27:51,791 --> 00:27:54,625
Mas Arif, I can't make it
until the afternoon.

321
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:56,750
I told your mother earlier.

322
00:27:56,833 --> 00:27:58,083
I have to go now, okay?

323
00:27:58,166 --> 00:27:59,416
Yes, thank you, Mbok.

324
00:29:40,666 --> 00:29:42,375
Still 39 degrees.

325
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,375
Let's take him to the doctor, Mom.

326
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,708
We'll go tomorrow.

327
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:52,083
For your father's checkup too.

328
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:55,125
Okay, Mom.

329
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:08,166
Ardi, Syifa.

330
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:10,666
Please sleep here with me.

331
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:13,750
Okay, I'm right here.

332
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:14,583
Okay?

333
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,750
I love you, Ardi.

334
00:30:17,791 --> 00:30:20,625
I love you so much too, all right?

335
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:22,583
I love you, Syifa.

336
00:30:24,125 --> 00:30:25,125
Get well soon.

337
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:28,375
I'll fry you all the eggs you want.

338
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:32,666
Ardi, Syifa.

339
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:35,500
Be strong and brave.

340
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,833
All right, that's enough.

341
00:30:46,458 --> 00:30:48,083
Go to sleep, all right?

342
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:55,541
Mom?

343
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,666
Dad!

344
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:27,958
- Dear!
- Dad!

345
00:32:28,041 --> 00:32:29,833
- What is it?
- Dear?

346
00:32:29,916 --> 00:32:31,500
Dad?

347
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:32,666
Mom...

348
00:32:34,458 --> 00:32:35,666
What's that, Mom?

349
00:32:50,875 --> 00:32:51,625
Dear?

350
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:54,250
Dad? Dad?

351
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:55,875
Wake Syifa up!
We're going to the hospital!

352
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:57,000
- Okay!
- Dear!

353
00:32:57,541 --> 00:32:59,166
Dear? Dear!

354
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,166
Syifa, wake up. Syifa!

355
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,250
Dad is having a seizure.

356
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:03,750
- Wake up! Dad is having a seizure!
- What?

357
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:06,625
Dear!

358
00:33:06,708 --> 00:33:08,250
- Mom?
- Dear!

359
00:33:08,958 --> 00:33:09,791
Dad?

360
00:33:09,875 --> 00:33:11,625
Mom, what's wrong with Dad?

361
00:33:11,708 --> 00:33:12,833
- Dear!
- Dad!

362
00:33:12,916 --> 00:33:14,625
It's 41 Kenanga Street, ma'am.

363
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:17,458
Yes, ma'am. Yes. Yes.

364
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:19,125
Thank you.

365
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:21,041
Dad?

366
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,333
Dad...

367
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:27,958
- It hurts!
- Arif? Arif!

368
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:31,708
- What's wrong?
- It hurts, Ardi, it hurts!

369
00:33:31,791 --> 00:33:33,208
Here, let me take a look.

370
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,958
Ah, it hurts!

371
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:38,458
Ah, Ardi, it hurts!

372
00:33:38,541 --> 00:33:40,375
Ah, it hurts, Ardi! Ardi!

373
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:45,500
It hurts! It hurts!

374
00:33:46,375 --> 00:33:47,583
Ah, it hurts!

375
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:52,250
Why? What's happened to you?

376
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:54,916
Arif? Arif! Arif!

377
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:58,875
Arif! Arif! Arif!

378
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,916
Arif? What's happened?

379
00:34:07,791 --> 00:34:09,458
Arif! Arif! What's happened to you?

380
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:11,625
Arif!

381
00:34:12,791 --> 00:34:14,750
Arif! Arif! Arif!

382
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,375
Arif! Arif! Arif!

383
00:34:20,916 --> 00:34:21,750
Arif!

384
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,250
Arif, wake up...

385
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:27,458
Mom! Mom!

386
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:29,458
- Syifa!
- Mom!

387
00:34:29,541 --> 00:34:31,541
- He's burning up, Mom!
- Wake up, Arif!

388
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:33,083
- Ardi?
- Mom!

389
00:34:33,166 --> 00:34:35,125
Mom! Syifa!

390
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:36,541
Arif!

391
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:37,333
Arif!

392
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:39,541
Mom! Mom!

393
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:44,125
Arif!

394
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:45,625
Arif...

395
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:30,125
- Leave.
- What is it?

396
00:35:30,208 --> 00:35:31,958
- Leave. I said leave!
- What is going on?

397
00:35:32,041 --> 00:35:33,750
- What's wrong, Ardi?
- Leave!

398
00:35:33,833 --> 00:35:36,125
- What?
- This is all your fault!

399
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:38,125
- What do you mean?
- Go!

400
00:35:38,208 --> 00:35:39,000
Let go!

401
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:40,625
- Sister...
- Go!

402
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:42,708
- My deepest condolences.
- Let go!

403
00:35:42,791 --> 00:35:43,708
Go!

404
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:48,708
- Go now! Leave!
- Enough, That's enough.

405
00:35:56,041 --> 00:35:58,500
Chronic brain dysfunction?

406
00:35:58,583 --> 00:35:59,333
Yes.

407
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:03,375
He seems conscious
and his vital functions are good,

408
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,833
but his body

409
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:08,500
shows no signs of self-awareness.

410
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:31,666
Dad.

411
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:35,166
Dad.

412
00:36:37,083 --> 00:36:39,375
You have to be sure you will heal, okay?

413
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:45,625
Mom, you need to eat.

414
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,250
Or else you'll get sick.

415
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:56,708
Let me die so I can be with Arif.

416
00:37:03,166 --> 00:37:04,458
Mom.

417
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:07,333
You still have me and Ardi.

418
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:32,666
Mom.

419
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:38,375
Do you still remember Mr. Rustam?

420
00:37:41,416 --> 00:37:42,541
Do you

421
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:46,250
still have his phone number or address?

422
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:48,791
What is it, Ardi?

423
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:52,666
I'm afraid...

424
00:37:54,708 --> 00:37:56,958
We are being attacked by black magic.

425
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:14,208
Your father is surrounded by bad forces.

426
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:19,208
Arif's death was also because of that.

427
00:38:21,041 --> 00:38:22,750
But the black magic used...

428
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:25,833
I'm not familiar with it.

429
00:38:26,541 --> 00:38:28,500
It does not seem to come from Java.

430
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,375
Then,

431
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:35,250
what are we supposed to do?

432
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:41,166
I can't remove the black magic.

433
00:38:41,958 --> 00:38:44,250
I need to find out
what kind of witchcraft this is.

434
00:38:44,833 --> 00:38:45,916
Only then can I help.

435
00:38:47,166 --> 00:38:47,916
But...

436
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:50,375
can we be protected,

437
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:51,916
so we don't get hit?

438
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:54,458
For now,

439
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,208
I can only shield you.

440
00:38:58,583 --> 00:38:59,458
Ma'am.

441
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:07,041
This amulet will hopefully
provide protection.

442
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,750
But if you suspect someone is using
black magic on your family,

443
00:39:12,041 --> 00:39:14,541
don't ever carelessly confront them.

444
00:39:15,791 --> 00:39:17,875
You might be killed on the spot.

445
00:39:19,875 --> 00:39:20,750
Understand?

446
00:39:22,875 --> 00:39:24,083
Yes, sir.

447
00:39:24,166 --> 00:39:25,083
All right.

448
00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:41,750
Dad.

449
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:43,708
I...

450
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:45,708
I'm going to run the shop, okay?

451
00:40:15,458 --> 00:40:17,500
Sir, can I help you?

452
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:19,083
Oh, no need, no need.

453
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,375
It's okay.

454
00:40:43,916 --> 00:40:45,833
- It's delicious, right?
- Yes, it is.

455
00:40:55,958 --> 00:40:58,541
Ma'am, please stop by.

456
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,750
Sorry, Ardi. Yesterday was quiet too.

457
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:03,875
That's right.

458
00:41:03,958 --> 00:41:06,875
Ever since your father got sick,
there have been no customers here.

459
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:21,458
Sir.

460
00:41:21,541 --> 00:41:23,833
You should tell him about it.

461
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:24,916
All right, just a second.

462
00:41:25,458 --> 00:41:27,208
But you should tell him, okay?

463
00:41:27,291 --> 00:41:28,916
What is going on?

464
00:41:31,083 --> 00:41:32,583
Well, Ardi,

465
00:41:32,666 --> 00:41:35,708
yesterday, there were
two employees who left,

466
00:41:35,791 --> 00:41:37,833
and me and my friends

467
00:41:38,291 --> 00:41:39,583
also want to resign.

468
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:42,625
Because we have another job offer.

469
00:41:43,291 --> 00:41:44,416
Oh, I see.

470
00:41:47,791 --> 00:41:49,041
Well, that's that then.

471
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:50,875
Take your last salary, okay?

472
00:41:50,958 --> 00:41:51,958
- All right.
- Yes.

473
00:42:04,333 --> 00:42:06,833
- Ma'am, what can I get you?
- Nothing, thank you.

474
00:42:06,916 --> 00:42:08,125
Yes, nothing.

475
00:42:10,166 --> 00:42:12,500
I need some rice.

476
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:14,833
Right, of course.

477
00:42:16,416 --> 00:42:18,375
How many kilos of rice do you need?

478
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,583
- Just one kilogram.
- Oh, okay.

479
00:42:30,875 --> 00:42:32,375
All right.

480
00:42:32,458 --> 00:42:35,041
I got you extra.

481
00:42:36,833 --> 00:42:38,041
Here you go.

482
00:42:46,833 --> 00:42:49,166
Where's your father?!

483
00:43:20,458 --> 00:43:21,375
Mr. Wicak?

484
00:43:23,416 --> 00:43:24,333
Mr. Wicak?

485
00:44:10,458 --> 00:44:13,000
- What are you doing here?
- Sir!

486
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:15,041
- Your father killed my daughter!
- Sir?!

487
00:44:15,125 --> 00:44:18,083
You, your father,
and your family must die!

488
00:44:18,166 --> 00:44:20,500
Leave! Leave!

489
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:34,791
Mom?

490
00:46:35,291 --> 00:46:36,708
Mom, what is it?

491
00:46:40,041 --> 00:46:41,000
I was just...

492
00:46:41,416 --> 00:46:43,250
I have a headache.

493
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:46,458
Okay, you should lie down.
Let me clean up.

494
00:47:42,666 --> 00:47:43,666
Mom!

495
00:47:45,958 --> 00:47:47,041
Mom!

496
00:47:48,125 --> 00:47:49,375
Mom? Mom!

497
00:47:54,583 --> 00:47:55,708
Ardi?

498
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:57,708
What happened?

499
00:47:59,833 --> 00:48:01,958
This is like Arif's illness.

500
00:48:06,458 --> 00:48:07,791
Call Mr. Rustam, will you?

501
00:48:28,208 --> 00:48:30,125
It seems like this is from the East.

502
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,250
If you see anything like this again...

503
00:48:43,208 --> 00:48:44,291
do not touch it.

504
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:46,333
Do not open it.

505
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:48,875
You could be cursed.

506
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,541
That's why you are still safe now.

507
00:48:58,041 --> 00:48:58,750
Ardi.

508
00:48:59,583 --> 00:49:00,291
Ardi!

509
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:06,125
- Uncle!
- Ardi?

510
00:49:07,416 --> 00:49:09,125
What kind of curse
are you going to send this time?

511
00:49:09,208 --> 00:49:12,750
Haven't you had enough?
You got Dad, and now Mom!

512
00:49:12,833 --> 00:49:14,041
What happened to her?

513
00:49:14,125 --> 00:49:15,708
Don't pretend to care.

514
00:49:15,791 --> 00:49:17,291
Who's next? Me?

515
00:49:17,375 --> 00:49:18,791
Or Syifa?

516
00:49:18,875 --> 00:49:19,875
Ardi!

517
00:49:19,958 --> 00:49:21,958
I have never put a curse on your family!

518
00:49:22,041 --> 00:49:23,250
Nonsense!

519
00:49:23,333 --> 00:49:25,666
I'm the one protecting your family!

520
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:27,416
Your father is the one using black magic!

521
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,125
Your father started it all!

522
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:33,916
<i>I got laid off, Sardi.</i>

523
00:49:36,125 --> 00:49:37,916
{\an8}I don't know what to do anymore.

524
00:49:40,875 --> 00:49:41,916
Sardi.

525
00:49:42,916 --> 00:49:44,750
Please help me.

526
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:47,375
If there is an empty stall here,

527
00:49:48,458 --> 00:49:49,708
I also want to start a shop.

528
00:49:50,958 --> 00:49:51,958
Please teach me.

529
00:49:52,041 --> 00:49:53,333
Here's your coffee and sugar.

530
00:49:53,416 --> 00:49:55,541
<i>I'm sure there's an empty stall.</i>

531
00:49:56,083 --> 00:49:58,333
I'll definitely help you too.

532
00:49:58,416 --> 00:49:59,958
Don't you worry.

533
00:50:18,083 --> 00:50:18,875
Cipto!

534
00:50:20,458 --> 00:50:21,875
Throw that away! Throw it!

535
00:50:22,375 --> 00:50:23,708
What was that?

536
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:30,166
<i>They kept sending him stuff.</i>

537
00:50:30,916 --> 00:50:32,666
<i>All sorts of things from different people.</i>

538
00:50:36,916 --> 00:50:39,583
<i>- Soon after, he started losing customers.</i>
- Welcome, ma'am.

539
00:50:40,916 --> 00:50:43,000
<i>He ended up not having any.</i>

540
00:50:45,583 --> 00:50:47,333
<i>At that time, you were also sick.</i>

541
00:50:47,916 --> 00:50:49,083
What should we do?

542
00:50:49,541 --> 00:50:51,125
If this continues, we will go bankrupt.

543
00:50:52,083 --> 00:50:53,833
Ardi also needs surgery.

544
00:50:55,333 --> 00:50:56,625
Be patient, Marni.

545
00:50:57,375 --> 00:50:58,166
Be patient.

546
00:51:00,541 --> 00:51:01,541
<i>At first,</i>

547
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:04,333
<i>your father didn't believe in witchcraft.</i>

548
00:51:06,916 --> 00:51:09,125
<i>But he thought it was all he could do.</i>

549
00:51:15,875 --> 00:51:16,875
Are you Mbah Di?

550
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:19,250
Yes, I am.

551
00:51:20,083 --> 00:51:21,541
How can I help you?

552
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:23,708
After his visit to the shaman,

553
00:51:23,791 --> 00:51:25,625
your father's shop
became the most popular.

554
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:31,500
His shaman had better powers

555
00:51:32,375 --> 00:51:35,333
than the shamans that other people used.

556
00:51:38,125 --> 00:51:40,833
He snatched all the customers
from his rivals.

557
00:51:42,791 --> 00:51:46,291
He could also return
all the stuff people sent.

558
00:51:50,416 --> 00:51:53,958
I told him not to be greedy.

559
00:51:56,625 --> 00:51:58,500
But he didn't want to hear it.

560
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:04,458
Your father was consumed
by revenge and greed.

561
00:52:05,875 --> 00:52:07,208
Until one day...

562
00:52:10,875 --> 00:52:12,833
Hang in there, Marni. Be strong.

563
00:52:14,041 --> 00:52:15,166
Nails?

564
00:52:15,625 --> 00:52:17,833
I've never seen anything
like this before, sir.

565
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:22,541
I have cleaned your wife's stomach.

566
00:52:23,916 --> 00:52:27,791
This one was sent by a person named Wicak.

567
00:52:28,625 --> 00:52:31,750
This isn't the first time
he's sent something.

568
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:34,083
But he has crossed the line.

569
00:52:34,166 --> 00:52:35,750
He hurt your wife.

570
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,458
What now?

571
00:52:44,875 --> 00:52:45,666
Mbah.

572
00:52:48,041 --> 00:52:49,500
Make him sick.

573
00:52:51,125 --> 00:52:52,458
Like my wife.

574
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:57,083
Dad, here's your drink.

575
00:52:57,166 --> 00:52:58,916
The eggs will be ready soon.

576
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,041
All right then.

577
00:53:05,458 --> 00:53:06,541
Dad.

578
00:53:06,625 --> 00:53:07,500
Sweetheart?

579
00:53:08,333 --> 00:53:09,958
- Dad!
- What's wrong?

580
00:53:10,041 --> 00:53:11,291
My stomach hurts, Dad.

581
00:53:12,125 --> 00:53:13,000
Sweetheart?

582
00:53:18,625 --> 00:53:19,458
Daughter?

583
00:53:25,041 --> 00:53:26,291
Sweetheart...

584
00:53:41,916 --> 00:53:43,083
Oh my!

585
00:53:56,791 --> 00:53:59,333
<i>The counterattack</i>
<i>was supposed to be for Wicak.</i>

586
00:54:00,208 --> 00:54:03,083
It was supposed to make him sick.

587
00:54:04,291 --> 00:54:05,708
But they missed.

588
00:54:06,333 --> 00:54:08,166
It hit Wicak's daughter and she died.

589
00:54:12,625 --> 00:54:14,625
Not long after that,
your father got sick, right?

590
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,708
Whatever shaman Wicak is using,

591
00:54:20,791 --> 00:54:22,125
they're definitely very strong.

592
00:54:23,541 --> 00:54:27,500
To the point that
your father couldn't return the curses.

593
00:54:29,541 --> 00:54:30,666
Even Arif...

594
00:54:31,583 --> 00:54:33,041
Dad would never use black magic.

595
00:54:33,666 --> 00:54:37,166
Mr. Rustam, the psychic,
said that he doesn't do magic.

596
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,166
That's because
your father has a protector.

597
00:54:43,208 --> 00:54:46,083
So that people don't know that
he's using witchcraft.

598
00:54:47,541 --> 00:54:49,416
I understand, Ardi. I do.

599
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:53,875
Because I used to use it too.

600
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:56,291
I used to dabble in black magic too.

601
00:54:56,375 --> 00:54:58,833
Until I lost my family because of it.

602
00:54:59,958 --> 00:55:00,666
Ardi.

603
00:55:01,541 --> 00:55:03,250
I work at the market.

604
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,416
I can also see things like you.

605
00:55:09,166 --> 00:55:12,416
So I know everything that happens here.

606
00:55:15,333 --> 00:55:16,125
You're lying.

607
00:55:17,791 --> 00:55:20,625
Dad doesn't even want to see a psychic.

608
00:55:21,166 --> 00:55:24,416
Uncle, you don't need to make up stories
to cover up your crimes.

609
00:55:25,208 --> 00:55:26,083
Ardi.

610
00:55:26,166 --> 00:55:27,875
If you don't believe it,

611
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:29,916
see for yourself.

612
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,500
Go check your father's office upstairs!

613
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:10,250
<i>Hello.</i>

614
00:57:11,291 --> 00:57:12,625
Good morning.

615
00:57:14,041 --> 00:57:16,333
Can I talk to Mbah Di?

616
00:57:20,208 --> 00:57:21,208
Syifa.

617
00:57:21,791 --> 00:57:23,083
<i>Yes?</i>

618
00:57:23,166 --> 00:57:25,041
I have to go now.

619
00:57:25,458 --> 00:57:27,708
I might be home late
because it is far away.

620
00:57:28,625 --> 00:57:29,625
<i>Where are you going?</i>

621
00:57:30,083 --> 00:57:31,416
Ramangunrejo Village.

622
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,625
You take care of Mom, okay?

623
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:52,041
Wait for me!

624
00:57:55,333 --> 00:57:56,791
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes?

625
00:57:56,875 --> 00:57:59,166
Is Mbah Di's house around here?

626
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:00,291
Oh, Mbah Di?

627
00:58:00,375 --> 00:58:02,708
Yes, it is. Let me take you there.

628
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:04,000
Thank you.

629
00:58:10,125 --> 00:58:11,291
This is her house.

630
00:58:13,958 --> 00:58:15,500
That's Retno,

631
00:58:16,541 --> 00:58:18,291
Mbah Di's daughter.

632
00:58:18,375 --> 00:58:19,916
Excuse me, Miss Retno.

633
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,916
There's someone looking for Mbah Di.

634
00:58:22,625 --> 00:58:23,750
Who is it, sir?

635
00:58:24,708 --> 00:58:25,791
I'm Ardi.

636
00:58:25,875 --> 00:58:27,041
Oh, hello.

637
00:58:27,125 --> 00:58:29,500
Well, I should excuse myself.

638
00:58:29,583 --> 00:58:30,791
- All right.
- Yes.

639
00:58:30,875 --> 00:58:32,541
- Thank you, sir.
- Yes.

640
00:58:32,625 --> 00:58:34,041
Take care.

641
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,791
I'm sorry, but what brings you here?

642
00:58:37,791 --> 00:58:39,083
I'm Ardi.

643
00:58:39,708 --> 00:58:41,000
Mr. Sucipto's son.

644
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:45,375
What do you want? Why are you here?

645
00:58:49,541 --> 00:58:51,375
Because she helped your father,

646
00:58:53,125 --> 00:58:55,041
my mother is also sick!

647
00:58:57,416 --> 00:58:58,750
She can't speak.

648
00:58:59,291 --> 00:59:00,750
She can't move.

649
00:59:00,833 --> 00:59:02,250
She can't do anything.

650
00:59:03,458 --> 00:59:05,333
Just like my father.

651
00:59:09,083 --> 00:59:11,041
After Wicak's daughter died,

652
00:59:11,583 --> 00:59:12,583
she said

653
00:59:13,208 --> 00:59:16,541
she could hear the sound
of an inland tribe.

654
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:19,458
She also said

655
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:23,125
that there was a huge black figure coming.

656
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:26,708
And then her condition

657
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:29,083
became like this.

658
00:59:33,833 --> 00:59:35,958
A huge black figure?

659
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:37,625
Yes.

660
00:59:37,708 --> 00:59:39,750
That's the black magic attack.

661
00:59:39,833 --> 00:59:41,500
That is why my mother

662
00:59:41,583 --> 00:59:43,583
can no longer protect your father.

663
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:47,875
Wicak uses a shaman

664
00:59:47,958 --> 00:59:50,625
whose power surpasses my mother's.

665
00:59:50,708 --> 00:59:52,375
They come from the East,

666
00:59:54,041 --> 00:59:56,125
and they use a type of black magic

667
00:59:56,208 --> 00:59:59,750
which is called Segoro Pitu.

668
01:00:03,458 --> 01:00:05,375
<i>That is high-level witchcraft.</i>

669
01:00:07,958 --> 01:00:10,791
<i>The ritual requires</i>
<i>the sacrifice of the soul,</i>

670
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:15,833
<i>based on hurt and revenge</i>

671
01:00:16,708 --> 01:00:18,208
<i>from the sender.</i>

672
01:00:20,375 --> 01:00:23,708
<i>They have to perform long rituals</i>

673
01:00:23,791 --> 01:00:26,625
<i>with an agreement ceremony</i>
<i>which is done</i>

674
01:00:26,708 --> 01:00:29,916
<i>seven times</i>
<i>at seven different coastal points</i>

675
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,291
<i>on Javanese soil.</i>

676
01:00:38,291 --> 01:00:41,791
It's done to summon an evil spirit
from across the Java Sea.

677
01:00:42,458 --> 01:00:47,333
Its ability to cross oceans
proves how strong it is.

678
01:00:48,458 --> 01:00:50,833
The evil spirit's name is Suanggi.

679
01:00:53,541 --> 01:00:54,500
Suanggi?

680
01:01:06,166 --> 01:01:07,000
Uncle!

681
01:01:07,583 --> 01:01:08,291
Ardi?

682
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:10,666
What is it?

683
01:01:13,333 --> 01:01:14,041
Uncle.

684
01:01:15,625 --> 01:01:17,458
Have you ever heard of Segoro Pitu?

685
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:27,833
Uncle, it's Mom!

686
01:01:27,916 --> 01:01:29,958
- It's Mom!
- Come on! Hurry, Ardi!

687
01:01:35,833 --> 01:01:37,333
Come on, come on, come on!

688
01:01:53,916 --> 01:01:54,791
Syifa.

689
01:01:56,125 --> 01:01:56,875
Syifa?

690
01:01:59,875 --> 01:02:00,625
Mom?

691
01:02:02,333 --> 01:02:03,458
Mom, are you okay?

692
01:02:04,208 --> 01:02:05,250
Still have a fever?

693
01:02:07,083 --> 01:02:08,166
Thank God.

694
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:10,916
Make me some hot tea.

695
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:13,041
Just a moment, Mom.

696
01:02:43,041 --> 01:02:44,041
Syifa!

697
01:02:51,041 --> 01:02:52,708
Syifa!

698
01:02:54,458 --> 01:02:55,166
Mom!

699
01:02:56,166 --> 01:02:57,125
What is it, Mom?

700
01:02:57,750 --> 01:02:59,291
Mom! What...

701
01:03:26,083 --> 01:03:26,916
Mom!

702
01:03:34,875 --> 01:03:35,916
Mom!

703
01:03:38,541 --> 01:03:39,625
Mom!

704
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:47,833
Come on, hurry up!

705
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:51,541
Mom!

706
01:03:51,625 --> 01:03:52,500
Mom.

707
01:03:53,333 --> 01:03:54,458
Mom!

708
01:03:54,541 --> 01:03:56,166
- Marni?
- Mom? Mom!

709
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:57,666
Mom!

710
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:58,666
Marni!

711
01:03:59,541 --> 01:04:00,333
Marni!

712
01:04:02,833 --> 01:04:03,708
Mom...

713
01:04:03,791 --> 01:04:05,250
Syifa. Syifa...

714
01:04:06,208 --> 01:04:08,541
- Marni...
- Mom!

715
01:04:08,625 --> 01:04:10,458
- Mom.
- Marni.

716
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,791
Mom!

717
01:04:12,875 --> 01:04:14,375
Oh my God, Marni.

718
01:04:19,416 --> 01:04:20,833
Marni!

719
01:04:21,583 --> 01:04:23,500
<i>May Allah forgive her,</i>

720
01:04:23,583 --> 01:04:25,208
<i>have mercy on her,</i>

721
01:04:25,291 --> 01:04:27,458
provide salvation,
and forgive her mistakes.

722
01:04:27,541 --> 01:04:30,333
Our Lord, give us good in this world,

723
01:04:30,416 --> 01:04:32,250
and good in the Hereafter,

724
01:04:32,333 --> 01:04:34,500
and defend us
from the torment of the Fire.

725
01:04:34,583 --> 01:04:36,583
Praise be to Allah,
the Lord of the Universe.

726
01:04:37,458 --> 01:04:38,958
Praise be to Allah,
the Lord of the Universe.

727
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:41,500
Ustadz, thank you.

728
01:04:41,583 --> 01:04:46,041
{\an8}BORN: 10 DEC 1943
DIED: 18 MAY 1983

729
01:05:06,333 --> 01:05:08,333
With this way,

730
01:05:08,416 --> 01:05:10,833
I ask for Your guidance,

731
01:05:10,916 --> 01:05:13,916
God Almighty.

732
01:05:16,916 --> 01:05:18,791
With this way,

733
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:23,000
I ask for Your guidance,

734
01:05:23,083 --> 01:05:25,333
God Almighty.

735
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:30,041
Protect me from
the bad things in front of me.

736
01:05:30,125 --> 01:05:34,333
Guide us to fight against
this black magic.

737
01:05:55,875 --> 01:05:56,833
Ardi.

738
01:05:56,916 --> 01:05:58,583
Forgive your father, okay?

739
01:05:58,666 --> 01:06:01,291
Everything your father did
was for you and your family.

740
01:06:01,375 --> 01:06:03,458
- Where are you going?
- Wicak.

741
01:06:03,541 --> 01:06:04,708
Ardi, wait.

742
01:06:06,458 --> 01:06:07,208
Ardi.

743
01:06:07,916 --> 01:06:09,375
Mr. Rustam said it would be dangerous

744
01:06:09,875 --> 01:06:13,083
if we carelessly confronted someone
who cursed our family.

745
01:06:13,166 --> 01:06:16,041
That is true.
Wicak might be very powerful.

746
01:06:16,125 --> 01:06:17,916
He is protected by his shaman.

747
01:06:20,916 --> 01:06:21,958
I'm confused.

748
01:06:22,583 --> 01:06:23,791
What am I supposed to do, Uncle?

749
01:06:26,875 --> 01:06:29,041
What? Now we just keep quiet?

750
01:06:29,791 --> 01:06:30,958
And wait

751
01:06:31,625 --> 01:06:34,291
until we become the next victims?

752
01:06:35,625 --> 01:06:38,083
Isn't that what Dad is doing now?

753
01:06:38,166 --> 01:06:40,666
Just waiting for death?

754
01:06:42,416 --> 01:06:44,250
Mr. Rustam isn't here either.

755
01:06:45,083 --> 01:06:46,250
What should we do?

756
01:06:58,083 --> 01:06:59,291
Hello.

757
01:07:01,625 --> 01:07:04,208
I'm sorry I couldn't help your mother.

758
01:07:07,875 --> 01:07:08,708
Come in, sir.

759
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:11,666
From the results of my meditation,
there are clues.

760
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:14,791
There is something we can do
to stop this curse.

761
01:07:19,916 --> 01:07:21,416
We need to perform <i>ruwat.</i>

762
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:27,333
<i>- Ruwat?</i>
- Yes.

763
01:07:27,916 --> 01:07:30,125
Purification using water from
the seven beach points

764
01:07:30,208 --> 01:07:31,708
where Wicak performed his rituals.

765
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:37,833
Someone must go to the seven beach points
to get some water there.

766
01:07:37,916 --> 01:07:38,833
Yes.

767
01:07:38,916 --> 01:07:41,500
Then take the water home
to purify your father.

768
01:07:43,333 --> 01:07:45,750
The purification must be done
on the same day as his <i>weton.</i>

769
01:07:46,791 --> 01:07:48,291
Your father's birthday.

770
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,500
And before 8:00 p.m.

771
01:07:51,916 --> 01:07:54,250
We still have five days left.

772
01:07:54,333 --> 01:07:55,125
All right.

773
01:07:56,250 --> 01:07:58,625
Later, I will tell you
the procedures and readings.

774
01:07:58,708 --> 01:07:59,750
Please do.

775
01:08:00,791 --> 01:08:02,000
Ardi.

776
01:08:03,708 --> 01:08:05,625
If you're willing,

777
01:08:05,708 --> 01:08:07,916
I can open your third eye completely.

778
01:08:13,166 --> 01:08:15,416
We need someone
with an unlimited sixth sense

779
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:16,916
to do this.

780
01:08:17,458 --> 01:08:20,208
Because later there,
you will face seven figures

781
01:08:20,708 --> 01:08:23,666
which were assigned by Wicak's shaman
to guard those places.

782
01:08:26,291 --> 01:08:28,041
You will still be able to see them

783
01:08:28,125 --> 01:08:30,791
even if they don't want to
show themselves to you.

784
01:08:35,875 --> 01:08:37,041
Rustam.

785
01:08:37,125 --> 01:08:38,458
I'll go with him.

786
01:08:38,541 --> 01:08:40,708
No, you stay here.

787
01:08:41,625 --> 01:08:45,000
I need your help
to prepare the purification ritual.

788
01:08:45,791 --> 01:08:47,041
Right.

789
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:50,000
If that's the case, then I'll go.

790
01:08:51,791 --> 01:08:52,625
Syifa.

791
01:08:53,708 --> 01:08:54,958
I want to help you.

792
01:08:57,166 --> 01:08:59,708
Do you want your third eye
to be fully opened?

793
01:09:01,791 --> 01:09:03,416
You have talent.

794
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:05,833
It just hasn't been opened naturally.

795
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:08,458
I can open it

796
01:09:08,541 --> 01:09:10,166
if you are willing.

797
01:09:16,833 --> 01:09:17,958
Yes, I am willing.

798
01:09:23,291 --> 01:09:27,000
This boy named Ardi Pangestu bin Sucipto

799
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:32,750
and this girl named
Syifa Aulia binti Sucipto

800
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:38,166
intend to open their crown chakra better.

801
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:49,958
Their eyes will see wider,

802
01:09:51,375 --> 01:09:53,458
their ears will also hear,

803
01:09:54,416 --> 01:09:57,000
and their hearts will also speak.

804
01:10:04,833 --> 01:10:13,375
Indeed, what has been given to them
is a gift.

805
01:10:15,333 --> 01:10:16,541
Open your eyes.

806
01:10:34,291 --> 01:10:35,666
Now, you should go.

807
01:10:37,041 --> 01:10:38,375
{\an8}DAY 1

808
01:10:38,458 --> 01:10:43,541
{\an8}<i>You start from the east, then go west,</i>
<i>starting from Watu Ulo Beach.</i>

809
01:10:43,625 --> 01:10:46,458
<i>But at which point on the beach, sir?</i>

810
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,250
<i>You'll know when you get there.</i>

811
01:10:49,333 --> 01:10:51,791
<i>Your sixth sense will give you clues.</i>

812
01:10:51,875 --> 01:10:53,916
- Right here.
- Yes.

813
01:11:16,125 --> 01:11:18,375
With this way,

814
01:11:19,625 --> 01:11:24,208
I ask for Your protection.

815
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:27,416
Where is it, Ardi?

816
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:29,291
There, at Watu Ulo.

817
01:11:44,166 --> 01:11:45,500
There it is, Syifa.

818
01:11:45,583 --> 01:11:46,625
Do you see it?

819
01:11:54,041 --> 01:11:55,250
I see it.

820
01:11:57,125 --> 01:11:58,875
Okay, come on.

821
01:12:00,333 --> 01:12:01,458
Ardi.

822
01:12:02,375 --> 01:12:05,416
Looks like we have to
put out the candles first.

823
01:12:06,333 --> 01:12:08,291
All right. I'll get some water then.

824
01:12:30,791 --> 01:12:33,041
- What are you doing?
- Ardi.

825
01:12:34,291 --> 01:12:35,458
I'm not afraid!

826
01:12:37,416 --> 01:12:38,958
Syifa, you go first.

827
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:51,375
Ardi!

828
01:12:52,791 --> 01:12:53,708
Come on.

829
01:13:01,583 --> 01:13:03,416
Hey, are you okay?

830
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:04,583
I'm okay.

831
01:13:04,666 --> 01:13:07,208
You're going to see a lot of things, okay?

832
01:13:09,875 --> 01:13:11,583
Syifa. Syifa. Syifa!

833
01:13:11,666 --> 01:13:12,791
It's okay!

834
01:13:12,875 --> 01:13:15,500
Ardi! Ardi!

835
01:13:17,458 --> 01:13:20,875
Ardi, hurry up, hurry up! Ardi!

836
01:13:29,291 --> 01:13:34,916
...who loves them and fights for them.

837
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,958
Ardi! Right here!

838
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:50,833
Ardi!

839
01:13:50,916 --> 01:13:52,708
- Ardi!
- Ignore it, come on!

840
01:13:55,333 --> 01:14:02,375
...who loves them and fights for them.

841
01:14:13,166 --> 01:14:14,166
Ardi!

842
01:14:14,875 --> 01:14:16,208
What is it?

843
01:14:18,125 --> 01:14:21,083
Come on, come on, come on!

844
01:14:21,166 --> 01:14:25,916
Give him a chance to come back to You.

845
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,541
DAY 2

846
01:14:31,458 --> 01:14:32,583
Come on.

847
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:38,916
No!

848
01:14:39,875 --> 01:14:40,625
- Ardi.
- Syifa!

849
01:14:48,458 --> 01:14:51,125
No!

850
01:14:59,625 --> 01:15:01,458
Syifa. Syifa. Syifa!

851
01:15:02,291 --> 01:15:05,625
Accept his regret.

852
01:15:05,708 --> 01:15:08,416
DAY 3

853
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:19,958
Ardi! Ardi!

854
01:15:20,541 --> 01:15:22,625
Come on, let's go. Let's go!

855
01:15:24,625 --> 01:15:27,375
DAY 4

856
01:15:36,333 --> 01:15:37,458
Where is it?

857
01:15:41,416 --> 01:15:42,208
There.

858
01:15:54,041 --> 01:15:57,083
Syifa, I'm getting the water.

859
01:15:57,166 --> 01:15:57,916
Okay.

860
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:17,083
Syifa. Syifa!

861
01:16:17,666 --> 01:16:18,708
Ardi!

862
01:16:19,791 --> 01:16:21,416
Come on, come on, come on!

863
01:16:56,833 --> 01:16:57,791
Syifa. Syifa.

864
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:03,875
This water is a gift from our Queen.

865
01:17:11,375 --> 01:17:12,708
Go home immediately.

866
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:15,500
Thank you.

867
01:17:38,416 --> 01:17:39,333
Rustam.

868
01:17:39,416 --> 01:17:40,958
Is Ardi here?

869
01:17:47,291 --> 01:17:48,333
What was that?

870
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:54,833
Rustam?

871
01:17:55,416 --> 01:17:56,291
Stay there.

872
01:17:56,750 --> 01:17:58,500
- Take care of Sucipto.
- Okay.

873
01:17:59,333 --> 01:18:00,125
Rustam!

874
01:18:18,583 --> 01:18:23,375
With this way, I ask for Your protection.

875
01:19:02,875 --> 01:19:07,458
With this way, I ask for Your protection.

876
01:19:07,541 --> 01:19:12,833
I play this song to protect us all.

877
01:19:37,375 --> 01:19:38,416
Rustam?

878
01:19:40,541 --> 01:19:41,333
Hello?

879
01:19:45,916 --> 01:19:47,000
Oh, God, forgive me.

880
01:19:47,083 --> 01:19:47,916
Rustam!

881
01:19:48,583 --> 01:19:49,458
Oh God...

882
01:21:00,625 --> 01:21:01,833
Uncle!

883
01:21:05,583 --> 01:21:06,333
Uncle...

884
01:21:06,875 --> 01:21:08,208
- Uncle...
- Uncle.

885
01:21:08,708 --> 01:21:09,833
Oh no.

886
01:21:17,833 --> 01:21:19,875
Uncle. Uncle...

887
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:24,958
Mr. Rustam.

888
01:21:25,625 --> 01:21:28,041
Mr. Rustam!

889
01:21:28,125 --> 01:21:29,291
Syifa.

890
01:21:29,375 --> 01:21:31,541
I'm going to Dad's bedroom.

891
01:21:32,708 --> 01:21:33,583
Uncle...

892
01:21:38,208 --> 01:21:42,166
Uncle...

893
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:44,583
Uncle...

894
01:21:44,666 --> 01:21:48,666
The waters of the seven seas will heal.

895
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:50,708
- Syifa, help me!
- Uncle!

896
01:21:57,833 --> 01:22:01,291
The waters of the seven seas will heal.

897
01:22:02,375 --> 01:22:05,125
The waters of the seven seas will heal.

898
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:11,333
Syifa, keep going, keep going.

899
01:22:11,833 --> 01:22:14,916
The waters of the seven seas will heal.

900
01:22:18,916 --> 01:22:20,791
Syifa, take care of Dad.

901
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:23,208
I'll find a flashlight.

902
01:22:53,083 --> 01:22:54,250
Ardi!

903
01:22:55,125 --> 01:22:56,916
Ardi! Ardi, are you okay?

904
01:23:06,750 --> 01:23:07,708
Go back inside.

905
01:23:07,791 --> 01:23:09,416
Go, continue the ritual.

906
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:11,333
Continue the ritual, Syifa!

907
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:13,583
Suanggi!

908
01:23:13,666 --> 01:23:15,791
Your business is with me!

909
01:23:19,375 --> 01:23:22,291
The waters of the seven seas will heal.

910
01:23:26,958 --> 01:23:27,833
Syifa.

911
01:23:27,916 --> 01:23:28,791
Syifa...

912
01:23:31,791 --> 01:23:32,583
Syifa!

913
01:23:32,666 --> 01:23:33,416
Syifa.

914
01:23:37,833 --> 01:23:38,875
Syifa...

915
01:23:38,958 --> 01:23:40,333
Ardi...

916
01:23:41,875 --> 01:23:44,000
Finish the ritual.

917
01:23:48,750 --> 01:23:49,875
Okay.

918
01:23:53,208 --> 01:23:56,916
The waters of the seven seas will heal.

919
01:23:58,541 --> 01:23:59,708
Ardi?

920
01:24:00,875 --> 01:24:01,833
Dad.

921
01:24:07,291 --> 01:24:09,333
The waters of the seven seas...

922
01:24:16,166 --> 01:24:17,291
Ardi...

923
01:24:20,208 --> 01:24:21,541
Dad! Dad!

924
01:24:22,916 --> 01:24:24,291
Dad! Dad!

925
01:24:25,916 --> 01:24:26,750
Let go of him!

926
01:24:27,666 --> 01:24:28,458
Ardi...

927
01:24:28,958 --> 01:24:30,208
Help me.

928
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,125
Help me, Ardi.

929
01:24:32,208 --> 01:24:33,291
Help.

930
01:24:35,541 --> 01:24:39,791
The waters of the seven seas will heal.

931
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:21,583
Dad? Dad!

932
01:25:25,875 --> 01:25:27,375
Dad. Dad?

933
01:25:27,458 --> 01:25:29,125
Dad, wake up. Dad?

934
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:30,791
Dad!

935
01:25:31,291 --> 01:25:32,875
Dad. Dad.

936
01:25:35,041 --> 01:25:36,791
- Dad?
- Dad, Syifa.

937
01:25:36,875 --> 01:25:38,291
- Dad?
- Dad.

938
01:25:38,375 --> 01:25:39,833
- Dad?
- Dad, wake up.

939
01:25:42,916 --> 01:25:44,208
- Dad?
- Syifa.

940
01:25:45,625 --> 01:25:46,750
Ardi.

941
01:25:48,833 --> 01:25:51,125
I'm so sorry.

942
01:25:54,166 --> 01:25:55,375
Forgive me.

943
01:26:39,333 --> 01:26:40,125
Mbah?

944
01:26:41,541 --> 01:26:42,250
Mbah!

945
01:26:48,291 --> 01:26:49,458
The candle is out, Mbah.

946
01:26:50,416 --> 01:26:53,875
Mbah, can't Suanggi complete the mission?

947
01:26:54,916 --> 01:26:56,041
What are you doing, Mbah?

948
01:26:56,125 --> 01:26:58,666
Making a talisman to protect us.

949
01:26:59,333 --> 01:27:00,416
What for?

950
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:01,708
You idiot!

951
01:27:01,791 --> 01:27:04,291
Those who send black magic
will be attacked

952
01:27:04,375 --> 01:27:05,833
if the creature they sent loses!

953
01:27:05,916 --> 01:27:08,500
Now get those oranges and bananas.

954
01:27:08,583 --> 01:27:09,333
Yes, Mbah.

955
01:27:11,583 --> 01:27:12,333
Here you go.

956
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,625
Mbah!

957
01:27:55,541 --> 01:27:57,041
Mbah!

958
01:28:27,833 --> 01:28:29,041
So

959
01:28:29,125 --> 01:28:30,500
after I got purified,

960
01:28:31,083 --> 01:28:32,625
you started to get better?

961
01:28:34,291 --> 01:28:35,166
Yes.

962
01:28:36,625 --> 01:28:39,708
That night, Suanggi left Java.

963
01:28:40,583 --> 01:28:44,625
So that being's power is no longer here.

964
01:28:46,875 --> 01:28:49,375
Mr. Wicak's witchcraft is indeed over.

965
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:51,833
But...

966
01:28:53,666 --> 01:28:55,583
what about the magic at your shop?

967
01:29:04,041 --> 01:29:07,333
I'm sorry.

968
01:29:09,541 --> 01:29:10,791
I promise

969
01:29:12,166 --> 01:29:13,708
I won't use it again.

970
01:29:52,875 --> 01:29:54,875
Your task is complete.

971
01:29:55,583 --> 01:29:57,125
Time to move.

972
01:29:58,666 --> 01:30:00,958
Come with me to the new house, okay?

3
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:11,333
Get out of here! Scram!

4
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,000
C'mon!

5
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:21,458
Shut her up!

6
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:35,750
What are you looking at?! I want
you in front!

7
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,041
Move it, Chepe!

8
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:38,208
I'm coming.

9
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:39,333
Three... Two...

10
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:40,208
One...

11
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:41,083
Let's go!

12
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:46,083
Out in front, Chepe!

13
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:19,666
BASED ON A TRUE STORY

14
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:36,083
Shoes on, now.

15
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:44,291
- I'm not telling you again. -
I'm coming!

16
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:45,375
Hurry up, everyone.

17
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,833
What are you doing?

18
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,708
Chepe?

19
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,000
Chepe!

20
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:42,000
Two besos, two chocolate
conchas,

21
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:46,375
and two ojos de buey. How many
is that?

22
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,750
A dozen.

23
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,166
Today is a big day, why not make
it two dozen?

24
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,541
Yeah, right?

25
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,666
Can I?

26
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,375
Hurry, come on.

27
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,083
Good morning my loves.

28
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:26,916
Everyone had a good breakfast?

29
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,708
Everyone except for Papa. He
only took coffee.

30
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:32,333
Straight home after school,
right?

31
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,541
Yes.

32
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,375
Where were you?

33
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,208
Hop on.

34
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,250
Better you get off here.

35
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:21,125
Chepe, do I have to go?

36
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,291
What did we agree?

37
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:23,791
Just for a few days.

38
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,208
Right, after that no one will
come poking around.

39
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:29,125
And then I can work with you,
no?

40
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,333
We'll see, Nico.

41
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:38,041
- Morning, Director. - Good
morning.

42
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,375
Stay close to the others.

43
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,958
- Look, toys! - Hey, get back
here.

44
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,833
WELCOME BACK STUDENTS!

45
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,208
Silence!

46
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:01,500
Silence, please.

47
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,583
Silence is the foundation of
obedience.

48
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:13,125
Obedience is the foundation of
discipline,

49
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:13,166
Obedience is the foundation of
discipline,
and discipline is the foundation
of learning.

50
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:19,083
and discipline is the foundation
of learning.

51
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:26,541
So, let's review our rules,
shall we?

52
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,791
Yeah!

53
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:31,666
- Good morning. - I brought
enough for everyone.

54
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,041
I'm glad to see that everyone -

55
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,500
Uh... Mr. Juárez?

56
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,083
Well, that almost everyone is
here.

57
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:44,875
As you know, Mrs. Álvarez gave
birth to a baby boy,

58
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:49,000
and two days ago decided to
become a full-time mother.

59
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,166
Fortunately, we found Mr.
Juárez,

60
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,333
He's from here in Matamoros,

61
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:56,541
and he kindly took the job at
the last-minute.

62
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:59,375
He's got a pulse, he's hired.

63
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:03,666
There's not much I can say you
don't already know, so I'll be

64
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,583
brief

65
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:09,291
Although primary education is
mandatory and free,

66
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,291
over half of our sixth graders

67
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:14,291
are dropping out. We are
failing.

68
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:17,291
According to our ENLACE test
scores we are the very worst.

69
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,791
I'm sure you're all aware of
this by now,

70
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:24,166
this year they approved an
incentive bonus

71
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,666
for those who meet certain score
thresholds.

72
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:31,208
If that can motivate us to do
our jobs just a little bit

73
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,333
better.

74
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,833
Let's not forget our kids, okay?

75
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:40,833
So... Let's have a good year,
shall we?

76
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:53,166
Do you smell that? Smells like
something.

77
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:56,125
It smells like... trash.

78
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:03,708
Hurry up! Quickly now!

79
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:06,375
- We don't have much time! -
What happened to the desks?

80
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:09,625
- Those aren't desks. - Why are
they upside down?

81
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,000
They're lifeboats!

82
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,208
And that's not the floor...

83
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:14,083
It's the ocean!

84
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:17,333
Each boat can only hold the same
number of passengers.

85
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:20,125
Those who don't get into a boat
will drown.

86
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:20,500
But be careful -

87
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,500
If any boat has more passengers
than the others it will sink

88
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,041
and everyone on board will
drown.

89
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:29,083
There's 23 of us here and only
six boats,

90
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:32,041
so, figure it out. Ready? Let's
go!

91
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,041
Five... four...

92
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:37,208
- Get in! - Three... two....!

93
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,125
One!

94
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,208
Come on!

95
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,375
Don't worry! I'll save you!

96
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,291
Help!

97
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:52,041
Help me! Please! Someone help
me!

98
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,541
Help... me...

99
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,041
Now eight boats!

100
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:39,041
What the hell is going on here?!

101
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:43,208
There's one last passenger! Save
him!

102
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:48,083
Five, four, three, two!

103
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,708
No, he's too fat! We won't
float!

104
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,083
He'll sink the boat!

105
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,166
Wait wait -

106
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,291
Why would he sink it?

107
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:01,250
Here's an interesting question.

108
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,166
What makes a boat float?

109
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:08,125
Or what determines how much
weight a boat can hold?

110
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,833
Anyone know?

111
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,208
No one?

112
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,166
Do you know?

113
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:22,083
No... I don't know either.

114
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,416
Yeah I don't know either.

115
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:28,708
Where do we find answers to
things we don't know?

116
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,041
How about the Internet?!

117
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:34,875
- I believe there's a computer
lab? - Yes.

118
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,708
It's out of service at the
moment.

119
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,208
Okay.

120
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:44,208
Where else can we find answers?

121
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,208
We ask the teacher.

122
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:53,041
We tried that but as you've seen
We don't know very much.

123
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,666
How about books?

124
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,166
Is the library in service?

125
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,041
To the library! Let's go!

126
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,708
Where's the library?

127
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,083
Come on, let's go!

128
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:33,500
- May I help you? - Yes
please... Mrs. Florita.

129
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,250
We don't have any class visits
scheduled today.

130
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,750
You don't have anything
scheduled for today.

131
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:43,000
Procedure requires notifying the
library at least one day in

132
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,625
advance,

133
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,208
with desired reference materials
identified in advance.

134
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:51,041
Yeah, yeah, but we'll be quick.
Where are the encyclopedias?

135
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:54,708
- They're here in back, BUT - -
Come on!

136
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,041
- This way. - Hey!

137
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:59,208
No running, please.

138
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,750
1974.

139
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,541
What did we come for?

140
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,666
Boats, barcos...

141
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:07,000
Oh, man.

142
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,541
There's no 'B'.

143
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:12,458
There's no 'B'. Where else can
we look?

144
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,708
How about 'F', for flotation?

145
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,500
You know what?

146
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,583
We don't need the encyclopedia.

147
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:38,125
You can figure this out on your
own.

148
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,125
Tell me.

149
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,208
Why do...

150
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,541
Why do things float?

151
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,083
Anyone?

152
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,541
Somebody. Just take a guess.

153
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,708
It doesn't matter if you're
wrong,

154
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,083
what matters is that you try.

155
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:56,208
what matters is that you try.
In fact, I'd prefer you get it
wrong.

156
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:59,000
In fact, I'd prefer you get it
wrong.

157
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,125
Yeah, because when we make
mistakes

158
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:04,208
we learn what we did wrong...

159
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:07,125
...and that can help us learn
what's right.

160
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,958
But, how will we get good
grades?

161
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,125
What do grades matter?

162
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:14,000
We need good grades to graduate,

163
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,083
and so that our parents don't
get mad at us.

164
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,458
That's all?

165
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,750
Fine, that's easy.

166
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:24,958
As of now, you all get a 10.

167
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,083
At the end of the year, when you
get your report cards, you're

168
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,875
all going to find there: your
10!

169
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,333
I promise.

170
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,500
Really. Got it?

171
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:38,208
Now we can get back to the
important stuff.

172
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,875
Who wants to be wrong first?

173
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,208
Come on, who?

174
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,208
No one?

175
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:55,041
Have you ever had a class like
that before?

176
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,750
I've never had a teacher like
that.

177
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,958
- What were we supposed to
learn? - About boats, obviously.

178
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:03,208
Do you think?

179
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,666
- Walk with us, Romeo? - What?

180
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:10,000
Don't worry, I can keep a
secret.

181
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,541
No, it's just that...

182
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:16,000
Have you noticed that Paloma
seems different this year?

183
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,875
Um, it's called puberty.

184
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:24,208
Heavy, no? Could be real silver.

185
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,125
You can replace the mirror.

186
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,208
Besides, I'm keeping it.

187
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,416
What do you want for it?

188
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:40,625
- Do you think he meant it? -
Why would he lie about something

189
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:43,041
like that?

190
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:43,166
like that?
Remember what he said? He wants
us to make mistakes.

191
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:47,541
Remember what he said? He wants
us to make mistakes.

192
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:51,458
If we don't have to be right,
it's okay if we're wrong,

193
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:56,166
and if it's okay to be wrong, we
can't get a bad grade.

194
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,875
I've never had a 10 before.

195
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,125
Papa, your nose.

196
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,083
It's nothing.

197
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:29,083
Come help me unload.

198
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:30,291
Ok.

199
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,916
Fifteen minutes of cartoons
while I make lunch,

200
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,083
and then it's homework time.

201
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,291
Aren't you working the night
shift, mama?

202
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,416
What are you doing up?

203
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,416
PREGNANCY TEST

204
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,125
Nico!

205
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,541
The pretty boy.

206
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:53,583
First day of school -

207
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:54,208
How did it go, man?

208
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,000
- Well - Last year, they
suspended him on the first day,

209
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,041
right?

210
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,250
It's not for him man, just like
his brother.

211
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,625
Can't sit still, always on the
go.

212
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,000
That's my Carlitos.

213
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,666
Staring out the window,
doodling, getting in fights...

214
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:11,166
Anything but paying attention,
am I right?

215
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:15,416
But it's ok, Nico. You got us to
take care of you.

216
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,208
You wanna learn from books...

217
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:22,208
...or do you wanna learn from
"la vida"?

218
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:26,208
This is the real school right
here, no?

219
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:32,583
- We better get going. - Word.

220
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,000
Let him carry it.

221
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,083
Mr. Juárez.

222
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,166
I missed you this morning at the
faculty meeting.

223
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,041
I missed you this morning at the
faculty meeting.

224
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:07,125
Yeah, I was... uh...

225
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:10,125
I had a lot of rearranging to do
in my classroom.

226
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,750
Yeah, I saw.

227
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,083
You have something against
furniture?

228
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:17,208
No... just... some.

229
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,541
Like your desk, for instance.

230
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,458
It's just I don't think I need a
desk.

231
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:26,875
You have to have a desk. Every
teacher has to have one.

232
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:30,041
Is there some rule written that
says I have to have a desk?

233
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,625
It's not the kind of rule that's
written,

234
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:35,125
but how will the students know
who's in charge?

235
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,041
Who's the authority?

236
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:38,791
Tell me -

237
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:43,041
You turn your classroom into a
playground, what's next?

238
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,750
Turn the playground into a
classroom?

239
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:53,083
What's your story, professor?
What do you mean?

240
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:56,000
This place, you know what they
call it?

241
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,083
- "School of Punishment." -
Exactly.

242
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,083
Yeah.

243
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:02,041
Your name was the first on the
transfer list.

244
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,041
The only name, in fact.

245
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:07,125
You asked to come here.

246
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,250
Why?

247
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,708
well...

248
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,875
Maybe I'm crazy?

249
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,583
You're running from something.

250
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:21,750
No, I just wanted to try
something different.

251
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,750
Like what?

252
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,041
I don't know.

253
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:28,916
I'm still trying to figure that
out.

254
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,666
Well, perhaps this is the place
to do it.

255
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:42,875
After all, no one gives a damn
what happens here.

256
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:48,166
Just do me a favor, don't go
kicking any hornets' nests.

257
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:51,416
No... why would I...

258
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,708
No.

259
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:55,916
The desk...

260
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,208
...stays inside.

261
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,750
Help me push it back?

262
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,208
C'mon...

263
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,291
Hey...

264
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:11,416
So... What's up with the
computer lab?

265
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,958
They were installed four years
ago,

266
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:29,041
and two months later they were
stolen.

267
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:34,583
- That was four years ago? -
Mhhm.

268
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:43,166
There are no other computers
here?

269
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:46,416
The only one that works is in my
office.

270
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:52,125
Welcome to Escuela Primaria José
Urbina López, Mr. Juárez..

271
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:37,041
THE MEGA YACHTS OF THE RICH AND
FAMOUS

272
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,875
What was that?

273
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:00,708
What's this?

274
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:03,125
I found it on the dump.

275
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:06,125
You should've left it there.

276
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:09,416
What use do we have for such
fantasies?

277
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:53,416
Come in, come in.

278
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:57,208
Sit wherever you like, there are
no assigned seats here.

279
00:23:57,208 --> 00:24:00,125
In fact, you don't even need to
sit if you don't want to.

280
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,416
Hurry, come in!

281
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:23,083
We're going to do amazing things
in here every day.

282
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:25,583
but if you come late, you'll
miss it.

283
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,541
Have you heard the story of the
burro that fell into the well?

284
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:34,208
No?

285
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:36,750
Then let me tell you...

286
00:24:37,916 --> 00:24:42,291
One day, a burro fell into a
deep well.

287
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:46,291
Miraculously, it wasn't hurt,
but it couldn't get out.

288
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:48,583
The farmer who owned the donkey

289
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:52,125
figured that rescuing it would
be very expensive,

290
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:54,041
certainly more than the burro
was worth.

291
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:58,416
And since the well was dry and a
danger to his other animals,

292
00:24:58,416 --> 00:25:01,083
he decided he should bury them
both:

293
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:03,375
The burro and the well.

294
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:06,000
So, he began to shovel dirt into
the well.

295
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,250
The dirt fell on the burro, who
cried out,

296
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:13,250
But the farmer kept on
shoveling.

297
00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:18,000
After a while, the burro fell
silent.

298
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,500
The farmer assumed the animal
was dead,

299
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:24,333
but he had to fill the well so
no one else would fall in.

300
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:27,750
So, he kept shoveling.

301
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:34,208
Imagine his surprise when he
suddenly saw

302
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:38,708
the tips of two ears sticking
out of the well.

303
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:40,916
He shoveled faster and faster,

304
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:47,041
as the burro's head slowly
emerged, shaking off the dirt.

305
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:50,208
Instead of letting itself get
buried,

306
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:53,166
the burro used all the dirt that
was thrown on it to step up and

307
00:25:53,166 --> 00:25:55,041
up

308
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:59,166
until the mound of dirt was high
enough

309
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:02,916
that it could jump right out of
the well.

310
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:08,291
From now, we are going to be
like that burro.

311
00:26:08,291 --> 00:26:11,166
No matter how much dirt gets
thrown at us, no matter how much

312
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:13,083
shit rains down,

313
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:15,916
we are not going to let it bury
us.

314
00:26:15,916 --> 00:26:19,125
We're going to shake it off, and
we're going to use it

315
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:22,083
to become the very best students
in the world.

316
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:28,000
There IS one thing that can stop
you though

317
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,083
if you let it.

318
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:34,750
It's you.

319
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:40,000
Now, I understand why you might
not

320
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,625
when there are kids your age in
the world

321
00:26:42,625 --> 00:26:46,958
who can solve formulas in
advanced calculus

322
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:51,208
or write symphonies, or even
build robots.

323
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:54,083
How could the students at José
Urbina ever do those kinds of

324
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:55,791
things,

325
00:26:55,791 --> 00:27:00,041
if we don't have computers, the
Internet,

326
00:27:00,041 --> 00:27:03,166
Sometimes we don't even have
electricity.

327
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:07,250
But, you know what?

328
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,791
We don't need any of that. None
of it.

329
00:27:10,791 --> 00:27:14,583
What you need, what each of you
needs,

330
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:17,208
you already have.

331
00:27:17,666 --> 00:27:19,416
And it's called...

332
00:27:19,416 --> 00:27:21,541
Potential.

333
00:27:21,625 --> 00:27:24,000
It's up to you whether you use
it or not.

334
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,916
I can't make you.

335
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:28,041
Neither can your parents.

336
00:27:28,041 --> 00:27:32,583
It's your responsibility to
decide if you want to use it,

337
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,583
and how you want to use it.

338
00:27:35,791 --> 00:27:36,458
So let's do this:

339
00:27:36,458 --> 00:27:39,916
From now on, I'm not going to
decide what we learn;

340
00:27:39,916 --> 00:27:42,916
YOU will. All right?

341
00:27:42,916 --> 00:27:46,875
So now, tell me:

342
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:48,875
What do you want to learn?

343
00:27:49,916 --> 00:27:52,833
It can be anything, anything at
all.

344
00:27:52,833 --> 00:27:55,041
What do you want to learn?

345
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:01,750
Oh, nothing.

346
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:03,916
No one? Nothing?

347
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,958
Perfect.

348
00:28:04,958 --> 00:28:07,291
Easy for me, then.

349
00:28:09,208 --> 00:28:11,416
We'll just sit here then...

350
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,750
...and learn about nothing.

351
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:19,291
And if you want to, we can do
this all year.

352
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:30,708
What was that?

353
00:28:30,916 --> 00:28:32,250
Who was it?

354
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,500
No one?

355
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:37,791
On the count of three, I want
everyone to raise their pen.

356
00:28:37,791 --> 00:28:40,583
One, two, three!

357
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:45,333
Come here.

358
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:47,916
Yes, you in the back.

359
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:50,291
Yes, you. Come.

360
00:28:56,375 --> 00:28:59,250
- What's your name? - Nico.

361
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:02,125
I also used to be the class
clown, Nico.

362
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:04,208
I was always punished.

363
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:06,875
I'll give you a piece of advice:

364
00:29:07,041 --> 00:29:09,041
Don't ever change.

365
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:26,541
Yes?

366
00:29:26,541 --> 00:29:29,208
No need to raise your hand.
What's your name?

367
00:29:29,208 --> 00:29:31,166
- Donovan. - Yes, Donovan?

368
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:35,750
I'd like to keep learning about
boats and ships.

369
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:42,291
Good, anyone think more about
our boats from yesterday?

370
00:29:43,541 --> 00:29:48,708
I realized that sometimes people
are going to die

371
00:29:48,708 --> 00:29:51,000
and there's nothing we can do
about it.

372
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,041
And that's life.

373
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:56,208
Whoa, heavy. "There's nothing we
can do."

374
00:29:56,208 --> 00:30:00,208
So, we should just let them die?

375
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:01,166
- Yes? - My name is Lupe.

376
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:03,666
You don't have to raise your
hand.

377
00:30:03,666 --> 00:30:06,666
I don't agree that there's
nothing we can do about it.

378
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:10,000
I think you need to do as much
as you can.

379
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,125
You need to do as much as you
can for as many as you can.

380
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:17,958
Very good, very good.

381
00:30:17,958 --> 00:30:20,166
You just said the same thing

382
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:23,500
as one of the world's greatest
philosophers.

383
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:27,166
His name is John Stuart Mill.

384
00:30:27,166 --> 00:30:29,166
Maybe you could be a
philosopher.

385
00:30:29,166 --> 00:30:30,958
What's a "philosopher"?

386
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:34,875
It's someone who studies
philosophy.

387
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:38,083
Which is a way to explore,

388
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:43,208
or talk about life's deepest,
most complicated questions,

389
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,625
which can be very hard to
understand.

390
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:48,000
and that helps us figure out
right from wrong.

391
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,125
But I still want to know why a
boat floats.

392
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:51,208
But I still want to know why a
boat floats.
Oh, right.

393
00:30:51,208 --> 00:30:52,083
Oh, right.

394
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:55,541
Have you thought about why the
boat would sink if the director

395
00:30:55,541 --> 00:30:57,958
got on?

396
00:30:57,958 --> 00:31:00,166
'Cause he's a fat ass.

397
00:31:00,166 --> 00:31:01,166
Good job!

398
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:03,958
You didn't raise your hand, well
done!

399
00:31:03,958 --> 00:31:05,708
Very good, thanks.

400
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:09,416
Tell me, Nico, why would the
boat sink because he's fat?

401
00:31:10,541 --> 00:31:13,666
Maybe because he's too heavy?

402
00:31:13,666 --> 00:31:17,041
Did you know a fat person floats
in water better

403
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:20,875
than a muscular person that
weighs the same?

404
00:31:21,208 --> 00:31:21,833
No?

405
00:31:21,833 --> 00:31:24,875
Can anyone tell me why that
might happen?

406
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,833
Why?

407
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:28,875
It's a tough one, but I know you
can do it.

408
00:31:28,875 --> 00:31:31,250
Think about it. Think, think,
think.

409
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:35,000
Who wants to take a guess? Or,
how about this?

410
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,041
Why if I blow up a balloon,

411
00:31:38,041 --> 00:31:41,125
it falls through the air, but
floats on water?

412
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:46,166
Remember a fat person floats
better

413
00:31:46,166 --> 00:31:50,041
than a muscular person who
weighs the same.

414
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:51,166
Why?

415
00:31:51,166 --> 00:31:52,875
Because they have different
sizes?

416
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:56,125
Ah, so then it's the size.
Maybe.

417
00:31:56,125 --> 00:31:59,500
What if I take a bowling ball
that is the same size as my

418
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,416
balloon,

419
00:32:01,416 --> 00:32:03,916
and drop them both on water?

420
00:32:03,916 --> 00:32:05,958
The bowling ball would sink,
it's heavier.

421
00:32:05,958 --> 00:32:09,208
- And the balloon would float. -
But, how?

422
00:32:09,208 --> 00:32:11,208
If they're the same size?

423
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:14,041
So, is it the size, or the
weight?

424
00:32:14,041 --> 00:32:16,416
I'll give you a clue.

425
00:32:16,625 --> 00:32:20,416
It has to do with the way
fractions work.

426
00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:24,666
That's precisely what we were
going to talk about today.

427
00:32:24,666 --> 00:32:27,875
Fractions, division, and
remainders.

428
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:29,708
Alright let's see...

429
00:32:29,708 --> 00:32:31,875
Remember the boat game?

430
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:35,250
Tell me, what were the
remainders.

431
00:32:36,916 --> 00:32:37,958
Think about it.

432
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:41,083
The passengers who didn't fit in
the boat?

433
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:42,041
Exactly!

434
00:32:42,041 --> 00:32:45,416
The passengers who couldn't fit
in the boat and drowned.

435
00:32:45,416 --> 00:32:47,041
Well done!

436
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:48,416
Wow.

437
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,541
You're so smart that, honestly,
I don't think that you even need

438
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:55,750
me here.

439
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:59,208
So... I'm going to go get a
drink...

440
00:32:59,291 --> 00:33:01,000
...and be back in 30 minutes.

441
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,208
I bet by the time I get back
you'll have all the answers.

442
00:33:06,916 --> 00:33:09,083
Anyone want anything? No?

443
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:10,750
I'll be right back.

444
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:32,750
- Muscle is heavier than fat. -
How do you know that?

445
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,416
My mom works at a butcher shop.

446
00:33:34,416 --> 00:33:37,500
A kilo of meat looks like this,
and a kilo of fat like this.

447
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,541
Maybe there's air in the fat and
that's why it floats.

448
00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:43,750
So if they weigh the same, the
fat guy should be bigger.

449
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:44,958
But what does it have to do with
size,

450
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:48,291
if a big balloon floats on
water, but a pebble will sink.

451
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:50,166
- Because it has air in it. -
Yes,

452
00:33:50,166 --> 00:33:53,750
but I I'm sure a giant balloon
would weigh more than a pebble.

453
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:56,125
So that's it then, a fat person
floats better because they have

454
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:58,416
more air inside.

455
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:01,166
Like Director Chucho.

456
00:34:13,541 --> 00:34:14,875
You must be the new guy.

457
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:17,000
I'm Arturo... Mr. García.

458
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,583
Hello, I'm Sergio.

459
00:34:19,583 --> 00:34:21,791
Is everything okay, Sergio?

460
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:24,125
Uh, yeah, I think so.

461
00:34:24,583 --> 00:34:28,208
The kids are getting the best of
you.

462
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,875
That's one way to put it.

463
00:34:30,875 --> 00:34:34,083
You can't let them see your
weaknesses.

464
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:37,833
The key is to discipline them
from the beginning.

465
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:40,875
They have to know who has the
authority.

466
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:46,708
Hmm, I think maybe it should be
exactly the opposite.

467
00:34:49,416 --> 00:34:51,875
Well, good luck with that.

468
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:53,583
Thanks.

469
00:34:57,583 --> 00:35:01,750
You know the most powerful words
a teacher can say?

470
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:04,208
I don't know.

471
00:35:04,208 --> 00:35:06,916
Ah, you do!

472
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:12,083
Shouldn't you be teaching right
now?

473
00:35:12,083 --> 00:35:14,125
Better I let them learn.

474
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:24,291
Mr. Juárez, everything all
right?

475
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:26,041
Sergio, just call me Sergio.

476
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:30,083
Shouldn't you be in your class
right now, MR. JUÁREZ?

477
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:32,125
Yeah, yeah. So?

478
00:35:32,125 --> 00:35:33,500
The kids are good.

479
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,666
Don't worry, in fact they may be
too good.

480
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:39,666
- This is the school's only
computer? - Yes.

481
00:35:39,666 --> 00:35:42,083
- May I use it for a minute? -
What? Now?

482
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:46,291
Yeah, it's just that these kids
are incredible.

483
00:35:46,291 --> 00:35:49,291
I can barely keep up with them.

484
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:51,708
I would've thought that a former
middle school teacher

485
00:35:51,708 --> 00:35:54,916
would be qualified to teach
sixth graders.

486
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,333
Yeah... me, too.

487
00:35:57,333 --> 00:36:01,416
It's just that they're... moving
so fast.

488
00:36:01,416 --> 00:36:05,750
Do you mind if I just...? Come
on, only for a sec -

489
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:08,125
Enough, Mr. Juárez! Let's go
let's go.

490
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,083
Enough, Mr. Juárez! Let's go
let's go.

491
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,208
Three minutes. Out.

492
00:36:10,208 --> 00:36:14,041
I'm sorry, Director. Daniel
won't stop crying.

493
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:18,208
What's wrong, little one? Do you
like clowns?

494
00:36:18,958 --> 00:36:22,208
Look! A clown's nose.

495
00:36:54,375 --> 00:36:57,166
What are you laughing at? What's
your name?

496
00:36:57,166 --> 00:36:59,583
Hey, come back! Wait!

497
00:37:15,791 --> 00:37:17,166
So, what did we learn?

498
00:37:17,166 --> 00:37:19,125
Have we figured out the problem?

499
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:22,000
FLOTATION = WEIGHT / SIZE

500
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:31,041
We think that if a fat man and a
muscular guy weigh the same,

501
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:34,416
then the fat man would be
bigger,

502
00:37:34,416 --> 00:37:37,000
because muscle is heavier than
fat.

503
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,125
Exactly! Well done!

504
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,125
What? What's wrong?

505
00:37:42,125 --> 00:37:47,291
We were sure that if two things
are the same size,

506
00:37:47,291 --> 00:37:50,625
then the lighter would float
better.

507
00:37:50,625 --> 00:37:53,208
Ha! You're both right!

508
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:55,750
How can that be?

509
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:59,500
It's called an inversely
proportional relationship,

510
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,500
and you figured out both parts
of it.

511
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:05,333
What we were calling
'flotation',

512
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:08,333
is the concept of density.

513
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:12,250
Where density equals mass over
volume.

514
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:15,375
Mass is another word for weight,

515
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:16,250
and volume is another word for
size.

516
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:18,083
and volume is another word for
size.

517
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:22,208
As the mass increases, we get
higher density,

518
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:26,041
but if volume increases, we get
lower density.

519
00:38:26,458 --> 00:38:28,125
Got it?

520
00:38:31,708 --> 00:38:34,125
In Spanish, please!

521
00:39:01,125 --> 00:39:04,458
- Mr. Director, won't you join
us? - What are you doing?!

522
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:07,750
- Isn't it cool? - I mean, why
are you out here?

523
00:39:08,208 --> 00:39:10,583
It was your idea, remember?

524
00:39:10,583 --> 00:39:13,208
Turn the playground into a
classroom.

525
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:16,000
You're supposed to be teaching
natural science,

526
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,333
Your lesson plan today, if I am
not mistaken, should be on the

527
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:19,291
Solar System.

528
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:21,541
That was the plan, but right now
they're more interested in

529
00:39:21,541 --> 00:39:23,916
physics.

530
00:39:24,541 --> 00:39:25,875
- Physics? - Yeah.

531
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:27,708
As far as I know, there's
nothing about physics on the

532
00:39:27,708 --> 00:39:30,166
ENLACE test.

533
00:39:30,541 --> 00:39:32,750
The ENLACE, sir. Come on.

534
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:36,875
Teaching to that test isn't
going to help these kids.

535
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:40,791
What does it really even
measure?

536
00:39:40,791 --> 00:39:42,208
Teachers.

537
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:45,208
Did you ever think of that?

538
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,041
Come here.

539
00:39:50,041 --> 00:39:52,916
What have you learned about
physics today?

540
00:39:52,916 --> 00:39:54,958
Um... not much.

541
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:58,000
I mean I understand the 'reverse
relationship' of density -

542
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,041
- Inversely proportional. -
Yeah, that.

543
00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:04,583
Inversely proportional...
between mass and volume

544
00:40:04,583 --> 00:40:07,041
and how that changes density...

545
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:11,625
But how those huge metal ships
are able to float...

546
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:12,833
I just don't know.

547
00:40:12,833 --> 00:40:14,625
But neither did you.

548
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:18,416
Well, uhm, that's a tough one.

549
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,833
- It's difficult. - I see...

550
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:22,625
So, who is more dense, then?

551
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:25,208
You, or the Director?

552
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,541
Uh, I'm sure that...

553
00:40:28,541 --> 00:40:32,750
the Director is far, far less
dense than I am.

554
00:40:32,958 --> 00:40:34,500
You like to push it, huh?

555
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,833
No, not at all.

556
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:41,416
Although he has a lot more mass
and much more volume,

557
00:40:41,541 --> 00:40:44,250
To know who is more or less
dense, we would have to measure

558
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,583
ourselves.

559
00:40:46,875 --> 00:40:48,541
How could we do that?

560
00:40:48,541 --> 00:40:51,125
If mass is weight, couldn't we
just weigh you?

561
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:55,041
Yes, we could. But what about
volume?

562
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:55,166
Yes, we could. But what about
volume?
Long by wide by high.

563
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:56,916
Long by wide by high.

564
00:40:56,916 --> 00:41:00,041
Length by width by height, but
very good.

565
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:04,208
That works for a regular object,
like a cube.

566
00:41:04,208 --> 00:41:07,041
What about an irregular object,
like a person?

567
00:41:07,041 --> 00:41:11,166
What's the Director's width? Is
it this...

568
00:41:11,166 --> 00:41:12,750
or this?

569
00:41:14,666 --> 00:41:17,625
Think about it. You're soooo
close.

570
00:41:17,625 --> 00:41:19,375
C'mon you've got this.

571
00:41:19,375 --> 00:41:22,750
You have the answer right in
front of you!

572
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:34,166
Oh, Paloma. One second.

573
00:41:35,291 --> 00:41:38,541
I saw your notebook. You know
all the answers,

574
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:41,708
Why didn't you share them with
your classmates?

575
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,291
Look, you have real ability and
-

576
00:41:46,291 --> 00:41:48,708
Aerospace engineer?

577
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:50,041
Pardon?

578
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:53,625
You told Lupe she could be a
philosopher.

579
00:41:53,625 --> 00:41:57,416
Do you think I could be an
aerospace engineer?

580
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:01,291
You want to design spaceships?

581
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:06,916
Well, several astronauts were
first aerospace engineers.

582
00:42:08,958 --> 00:42:10,500
Whoa...

583
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,916
Astronaut.

584
00:42:13,083 --> 00:42:14,250
Okay.

585
00:42:14,916 --> 00:42:18,250
I guess we have our work cut out
for us.

586
00:42:19,083 --> 00:42:20,166
Paloma...

587
00:42:20,166 --> 00:42:21,333
If you could try to share a
little bit more with your

588
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:23,666
classmates,

589
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:26,708
there's a lot we could learn
from you.

590
00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:29,583
Do you think you can try?

591
00:42:36,166 --> 00:42:39,041
Why are we going the wrong way?

592
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,541
Can I help you? Um...

593
00:42:49,541 --> 00:42:52,083
Do you have any books about
philosophy?

594
00:42:52,083 --> 00:42:53,750
Philosophy?

595
00:42:54,166 --> 00:42:56,750
Or philosophers?

596
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,541
Philosophers?

597
00:42:59,416 --> 00:43:02,125
Maybe John Stuart Mill?

598
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:02,916
Who?

599
00:43:02,916 --> 00:43:03,333
John Stuart -

600
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:05,875
Those are college subjects,

601
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:08,416
I don't know why you'd have any
need to read stuff like that at

602
00:43:08,416 --> 00:43:10,875
your age?

603
00:43:12,041 --> 00:43:14,125
Okay, well, thanks.

604
00:43:17,583 --> 00:43:19,416
Is that what you wanted?

605
00:43:20,791 --> 00:43:22,750
Watcha got there?

606
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,208
Did you know you can burn things
with that using sunlight?

607
00:43:26,208 --> 00:43:29,708
- I did. - Yeah, who doesn't,
right?

608
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:33,083
What a couple! The nerd and the
hoodlum.

609
00:43:38,875 --> 00:43:41,041
Go to hell.

610
00:43:42,041 --> 00:43:46,458
- Afternoon, Director. - Good
afternoon, Mr. García.

611
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:49,000
This new guy, Mr. Juárez...

612
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,166
- What do you know about him? -
Well...

613
00:43:51,166 --> 00:43:56,083
I checked his evaluations, his
references, the usual.

614
00:43:56,083 --> 00:43:58,875
- Is that all? - Yeah.

615
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:01,041
That's interesting,

616
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:02,416
because...

617
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:05,916
I made a few calls...

618
00:44:18,083 --> 00:44:20,833
Where were you? I was worried.

619
00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:24,166
I guess I've been moving slower
today.

620
00:44:31,041 --> 00:44:32,500
What was that for?

621
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:35,875
I don't know. I had a good day.

622
00:44:37,166 --> 00:44:38,875
Come on.

623
00:44:42,125 --> 00:44:44,208
It floats!

624
00:44:47,125 --> 00:44:49,291
Ok, you won.

625
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:53,208
But why do you think it floats?

626
00:45:42,583 --> 00:45:45,833
Mr. Juárez, I hope you don't
mind.

627
00:45:45,833 --> 00:45:48,291
Not at all, come in.

628
00:45:48,291 --> 00:45:50,416
Please, come in.

629
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:55,875
- How are you? This way. - I'm
fine.

630
00:45:56,208 --> 00:45:58,208
Look, before this goes any
further,

631
00:45:58,208 --> 00:46:01,166
I need to know exactly what
you're up to.

632
00:46:01,166 --> 00:46:04,875
So, I guess it isn't true that
"no one gives a damn.”

633
00:46:04,875 --> 00:46:07,875
It's my responsibility to look
out for my kids.

634
00:46:08,166 --> 00:46:10,125
"My kids..."

635
00:46:10,625 --> 00:46:12,041
Listen.

636
00:46:12,041 --> 00:46:14,291
I called your old school.

637
00:46:14,291 --> 00:46:18,166
They told me about an "incident"
you had there.

638
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:21,708
I had an episode in front of the
students.

639
00:46:21,708 --> 00:46:26,041
A kind of existential crisis,
let's say.

640
00:46:26,041 --> 00:46:27,666
I'm fine.

641
00:46:27,666 --> 00:46:29,458
What else do you want to know?

642
00:46:29,458 --> 00:46:30,541
Nothing, nothing.

643
00:46:30,541 --> 00:46:32,041
I'm only trying to understand
what it is you're trying to do

644
00:46:32,041 --> 00:46:34,083
here.

645
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:36,083
I mean, what's your method?

646
00:46:36,083 --> 00:46:38,083
No, no...

647
00:46:38,875 --> 00:46:41,583
I don't have a method exactly.

648
00:46:41,875 --> 00:46:42,666
I don't understand.

649
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:44,583
Hey, can I offer you a beer?

650
00:46:44,583 --> 00:46:48,750
- No, I was just - - Please, I'm
inviting you in to my home.

651
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,041
Honey? We have a guest.

652
00:46:52,208 --> 00:46:53,375
- Good afternoon. - Hello.

653
00:46:53,375 --> 00:46:55,833
This is my wife, Laura. He's my
boss.

654
00:46:55,833 --> 00:46:59,208
Oh, I thought I was the boss.

655
00:46:59,958 --> 00:47:01,708
Nice to meet you.

656
00:47:01,708 --> 00:47:03,125
I'm Chucho.

657
00:47:03,125 --> 00:47:05,708
And this is our little surprise.

658
00:47:06,708 --> 00:47:08,875
He can be a bit impertinent.

659
00:47:08,875 --> 00:47:10,458
Yeah, I've noticed.

660
00:47:10,458 --> 00:47:14,083
I'm going to put the baby down.
Make yourself at home.

661
00:47:14,083 --> 00:47:16,708
Thank you. Excuse me.

662
00:47:19,875 --> 00:47:23,583
You asked why I came here.

663
00:47:24,958 --> 00:47:26,583
"José Urbina López Elementary
School

664
00:47:26,583 --> 00:47:30,125
receives... grant for a computer
lab."

665
00:47:30,541 --> 00:47:33,166
That's dated eight months ago.

666
00:47:33,166 --> 00:47:35,291
It says the funds were already
disbursed.

667
00:47:35,291 --> 00:47:39,750
They were disbursed all right,
but they never got to us.

668
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:42,875
- You know how it goes. - Yeah.

669
00:47:42,875 --> 00:47:46,291
"They'll be there tomorrow, no
need to press."

670
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,333
In Matamoros you don't press
more if you know what's good for

671
00:47:48,333 --> 00:47:50,291
you.

672
00:47:50,291 --> 00:47:53,250
Of course, yeah, sure.

673
00:47:55,333 --> 00:47:57,375
Why the obsession?

674
00:47:57,375 --> 00:48:01,583
We grew up without computer labs
and we turned out fine.

675
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,208
You have one of those phones
that go online?

676
00:48:06,208 --> 00:48:07,333
Yeah, why?

677
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:10,250
Can I borrow it? I want to show
you something.

678
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:17,125
By the way,

679
00:48:17,125 --> 00:48:20,500
there's a girl in my class,
Paloma Noyola.

680
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,750
- What do you know about her? -
Not much. Quiet...

681
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:26,125
Could apply herself more.

682
00:48:26,583 --> 00:48:29,708
- That's it? - Yeah, why?

683
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:48,083
- This is the last of it. -
Let's see...

684
00:48:48,083 --> 00:48:50,958
18 kilos of iron at 55 cents per
kilo,

685
00:48:50,958 --> 00:48:53,000
3 kilos of aluminum, at 11 pesos
per kilo,

686
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,875
4 kilos of bronze at 2.75,

687
00:48:54,875 --> 00:48:57,416
and 3 kilos of copper at 26
pesos.

688
00:48:57,416 --> 00:49:00,125
The total comes to 105 pesos.

689
00:49:06,958 --> 00:49:07,666
Let's go.

690
00:49:07,666 --> 00:49:09,208
He shorted you.

691
00:49:09,583 --> 00:49:10,666
What's that?

692
00:49:10,666 --> 00:49:12,708
Papa, he's cheating you.

693
00:49:14,041 --> 00:49:18,166
Excuse me? I think you counted
wrong.

694
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:22,083
It should be 131.9 pesos.

695
00:49:22,208 --> 00:49:24,708
Rounded up, 132 pesos.

696
00:49:24,708 --> 00:49:28,250
Would you check again? Of
course...

697
00:49:31,416 --> 00:49:36,958
Look at that... you're right.
It's 131.90 pesos.

698
00:49:37,041 --> 00:49:39,916
Sorry. Must've hit the wrong
key.

699
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:56,166
Nico!

700
00:49:56,625 --> 00:49:57,291
What happened?!

701
00:49:57,291 --> 00:50:00,125
You didn't come to Nacho's.

702
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:01,666
I'm sorry, I just -

703
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:03,083
Where's your backpack?

704
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,250
It's inside.

705
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:06,708
You need to think, Nico!

706
00:50:29,958 --> 00:50:31,583
It's okay.

707
00:50:34,125 --> 00:50:37,250
I'll be fine. You sure?

708
00:50:40,541 --> 00:50:42,416
What are you doing?

709
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:50,208
Ever since I can remember, this
thing has been here, rotting

710
00:50:51,125 --> 00:50:54,375
Think you can fix it?

711
00:50:54,375 --> 00:50:55,833
Maybe.

712
00:50:55,833 --> 00:50:59,208
I've been learning about
flotation at school.

713
00:50:59,208 --> 00:51:01,625
Flotation? Really?

714
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:04,708
- How will you get it to float?
- Well...

715
00:51:04,708 --> 00:51:07,833
First, I have to keep the water
out of it.

716
00:51:07,833 --> 00:51:12,166
- Duh, obviously! - No, what I
meant is...

717
00:51:12,166 --> 00:51:12,208
- Duh, obviously! - No, what I
meant is...
I need to seal all the holes
because if water gets in...

718
00:51:12,208 --> 00:51:17,166
I need to seal all the holes
because if water gets in...

719
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:20,541
What?

720
00:51:21,125 --> 00:51:23,041
Maybe... maybe that's it.

721
00:51:23,041 --> 00:51:26,125
Even though it's not sealed like
a balloon,

722
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:29,291
it uses the air in this space,
somehow,

723
00:51:29,291 --> 00:51:32,250
so that it makes the boat less
dense than the water!

724
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:34,583
Yeah! That could be it!

725
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,166
Look at you...

726
00:51:36,166 --> 00:51:38,583
Getting all scientific!

727
00:51:44,583 --> 00:51:46,500
What is it?

728
00:51:46,583 --> 00:51:50,250
Do you think I could stay in
school, at least for a little

729
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:52,583
longer?

730
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:55,083
Jeez, I don't know, man.

731
00:51:55,083 --> 00:51:58,708
- Let me talk to Nacho, okay? -
All right.

732
00:52:33,916 --> 00:52:37,250
You're trying to tell me your
entire approach is based on

733
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:39,875
some... YouTube video?

734
00:52:40,916 --> 00:52:43,125
Yeah, pretty much.

735
00:52:43,125 --> 00:52:46,708
So you said to hell with the
curriculum?

736
00:52:47,125 --> 00:52:49,416
Yeah, pretty much.

737
00:52:52,916 --> 00:52:55,916
We'll get it all covered
eventually, but,

738
00:52:55,916 --> 00:52:59,750
When they want to, when it's
their idea.

739
00:53:00,541 --> 00:53:02,958
Although, after what I saw
today,

740
00:53:02,958 --> 00:53:05,416
I'm not even sure they need me.

741
00:53:07,708 --> 00:53:10,000
If they had computers,

742
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,750
they'd learn everything by
themselves.

743
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:14,208
Oh my god.

744
00:53:18,875 --> 00:53:20,583
Here.

745
00:53:21,125 --> 00:53:24,041
Did you ever teach?

746
00:53:24,041 --> 00:53:26,500
It's a requirement to become a
Director.

747
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:30,875
So then you remember why you
decided to become a teacher, no?

748
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:33,208
That was a long time ago.

749
00:53:34,083 --> 00:53:37,208
What was the name of that
teacher?

750
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,125
Mrs. Carmona.

751
00:53:45,166 --> 00:53:47,750
Mine was Mr. Chávez.

752
00:53:48,125 --> 00:53:51,208
Profe Juan Antonio Chávez.

753
00:53:52,375 --> 00:53:55,166
He told me I could change the
world,

754
00:53:55,166 --> 00:53:57,083
and I believed him.

755
00:53:58,166 --> 00:54:00,750
I remember how I gave him a hug
up there, in front of everyone,

756
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:02,666
at my graduation.

757
00:54:02,666 --> 00:54:06,541
When I started teaching my kids
would come up to hug me, too.

758
00:54:07,041 --> 00:54:12,041
but over time, each year there
were fewer and fewer,

759
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:17,208
until last year, not one.

760
00:54:18,791 --> 00:54:21,041
Kids have changed

761
00:54:21,041 --> 00:54:22,875
No.

762
00:54:23,333 --> 00:54:26,416
Kids will always be kids.

763
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,208
The world has changed, Mr.
Juárez.

764
00:54:35,208 --> 00:54:37,958
Yes, but we haven't.

765
00:54:37,958 --> 00:54:41,083
Nothing in education has changed
in the last 100 years.

766
00:54:41,083 --> 00:54:44,958
Nothing. From the school bell to
the uniforms.

767
00:54:44,958 --> 00:54:48,916
"Be quiet! Stand in line! Raise
your hand!"

768
00:54:48,916 --> 00:54:52,416
We're training these kids to be
cogs in a machine

769
00:54:52,416 --> 00:54:56,583
whose only purpose is to keep
running for its own sake.

770
00:54:57,666 --> 00:55:00,125
And if it chews them up and
spits them out,

771
00:55:00,125 --> 00:55:04,125
it's because they didn't follow
the rules of our little game.

772
00:55:04,125 --> 00:55:07,750
But these kids are so much
smarter than that.

773
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:12,291
They know full well the machine
is obsolete.

774
00:55:12,916 --> 00:55:17,416
So they tune out, they drift
away...

775
00:55:18,291 --> 00:55:20,583
...and we lose them.

776
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:25,291
You asked me why I came here.

777
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:31,166
I don't want to lose any more
kids.

778
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,708
Not one more.

779
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:38,666
Aren't you a little old to be
such an idealist?

780
00:55:38,666 --> 00:55:42,083
I'm a little too old to be a new
Dad again.

781
00:55:49,416 --> 00:55:53,750
- Okay, Mr. Juárez... - Sergio,
just Sergio.

782
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,208
Call me Sergio.

783
00:55:56,541 --> 00:55:58,750
Okay, Sergio.

784
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,166
I'm going to give you a
chance...

785
00:56:02,166 --> 00:56:04,750
...just don't piss it away, eh?

786
00:56:08,125 --> 00:56:10,458
Oh, actually...

787
00:56:10,458 --> 00:56:13,416
Can I ask you for one more tiny
favor?

788
00:56:15,333 --> 00:56:17,708
It's ready, get in.

789
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,208
Mom, time to get up.

790
00:56:28,083 --> 00:56:32,416
What's going on? Come on, help
me out here.

791
00:56:35,375 --> 00:56:36,375
Good evening.

792
00:56:36,375 --> 00:56:39,125
Breakfast is on the table,
coffee's ready.

793
00:56:39,125 --> 00:56:40,500
Thank you.

794
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:41,583
All right, in you go.

795
00:56:41,583 --> 00:56:47,083
No! What are you doing!? You
didn't take off your underwear.

796
00:56:50,041 --> 00:56:51,125
Hey...

797
00:56:51,125 --> 00:56:53,166
Get out, get out!

798
00:56:57,833 --> 00:57:00,250
Uhh, get back in...

799
00:57:09,416 --> 00:57:11,083
How much?

800
00:57:11,083 --> 00:57:14,125
- Seven centimeters. - Yeah!

801
00:57:14,583 --> 00:57:16,333
Next. Next!

802
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:18,416
Wait, I changed my mind!

803
00:57:21,375 --> 00:57:24,125
Ok, I'm here.

804
00:57:26,166 --> 00:57:28,458
"Tiny favor."

805
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:32,750
- It's for the kids, remember? -
For the kids.

806
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:35,916
For the kids... This is for the
kids!

807
00:57:35,916 --> 00:57:37,875
For the kids!

808
00:57:37,958 --> 00:57:39,875
For the kids!

809
00:57:44,041 --> 00:57:46,208
I'm going, I'm going.

810
00:57:54,666 --> 00:57:56,875
- Ten Centimeters. - Ten
centimeters!

811
00:58:03,041 --> 00:58:03,541
Sergio is more dense!

812
00:58:03,541 --> 00:58:04,750
Sergio is more dense!

813
00:58:29,916 --> 00:58:34,750
We can build a water heater, or
an oven...

814
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:38,041
I have an idea! Check this out.

815
00:58:38,041 --> 00:58:41,125
- We're going to win! - Hell,
yeah!

816
00:59:02,541 --> 00:59:05,500
Hi, there. Can I help you?

817
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,583
Do you have any books about
philosophy?

818
00:59:08,583 --> 00:59:09,416
Of course.

819
00:59:09,416 --> 00:59:12,208
Are you interested in any area
in particular?

820
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:17,000
Metaphysics? Ontology?
Epistemology?

821
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:21,208
Morality? Logic? Aesthetics?

822
00:59:23,208 --> 00:59:25,125
Marlene, can you give me a hand?

823
00:59:30,958 --> 00:59:32,583
Here you go.

824
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:49,250
- This never happens! - Give it
a whack.

825
00:59:53,666 --> 00:59:54,583
Sorry.

826
01:00:01,208 --> 01:00:01,958
Over here.

827
01:00:01,958 --> 01:00:04,916
None of that is usable. Take all
you want.

828
01:00:05,041 --> 01:00:08,750
Careful not to cut yourself.
Good luck.

829
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:15,916
We believe gravity is that which
makes us fall,

830
01:00:15,916 --> 01:00:17,708
but it only seems like we're
falling.

831
01:00:17,708 --> 01:00:21,416
When we're actually being pulled
towards Earth,

832
01:00:21,416 --> 01:00:24,750
because its mass is so enormous
compared to ours.

833
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:27,416
It's the same reason why the sun
pulls the Earth.

834
01:00:27,416 --> 01:00:29,875
Then, if the sun is pulling the
Earth how come we don't just

835
01:00:29,875 --> 01:00:31,666
crash into the sun?

836
01:00:31,666 --> 01:00:35,625
Because the orbit is the exact
spot where a planet is caught

837
01:00:35,625 --> 01:00:37,041
between falling towards
something and falling away from

838
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:39,125
it.

839
01:00:39,125 --> 01:00:42,375
So, the entire universe, all of
us, all the time,

840
01:00:42,375 --> 01:00:45,750
are actually just falling
through space?

841
01:00:46,083 --> 01:00:49,125
- Yeah, something like that. -
Cool!

842
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:59,250
- Hey watch where you point
that. - Sorry!

843
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:00,708
Okay, so...

844
01:01:00,708 --> 01:01:04,166
Everyone knows that a magnifying
glass can burn things.

845
01:01:06,291 --> 01:01:10,916
This is unfocused light
reflected onto my hand.

846
01:01:10,916 --> 01:01:13,875
But what happens if we focus it?

847
01:01:25,166 --> 01:01:25,625
Tada!

848
01:01:25,625 --> 01:01:28,416
I hope you enjoyed our Solar
Death Ray!

849
01:01:28,416 --> 01:01:32,125
If you think that was cool,
You'll like this even more...

850
01:01:32,125 --> 01:01:35,208
Watch what it does to this
bottle of gasoline!

851
01:01:44,166 --> 01:01:45,208
Rotation!

852
01:01:45,208 --> 01:01:48,875
Come on, everyone! Let me see
you rotating!

853
01:02:07,083 --> 01:02:08,791
Rotation!

854
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:11,208
Now revolution!

855
01:02:26,833 --> 01:02:31,416
JOSÉ URBINA ELEMENTARY RECEIVES
GRANT FOR COMPUTER LAB

856
01:02:54,833 --> 01:02:57,041
Why so early, Nico?

857
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:00,208
Everything ok?

858
01:03:00,666 --> 01:03:03,291
All right, tell me.

859
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:08,416
You said we could ask you
anything, right?

860
01:03:08,416 --> 01:03:09,083
Yup.

861
01:03:09,083 --> 01:03:12,250
And there is no question that's
too weird or that we shouldn't

862
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:13,208
ask, right?

863
01:03:13,208 --> 01:03:15,208
That's right.

864
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:19,791
Okay, so... here's my question.

865
01:03:19,791 --> 01:03:21,250
Shoot.

866
01:03:25,625 --> 01:03:28,416
How do I get a girl to like me?

867
01:03:29,041 --> 01:03:31,000
- See! - No, no!

868
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,583
It's a very good question.

869
01:03:33,583 --> 01:03:36,750
A very important question, in
fact.

870
01:03:36,916 --> 01:03:39,125
I'm serious, but...

871
01:03:39,291 --> 01:03:43,500
like all big questions, there's
no one answer.

872
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:45,791
Dammit.

873
01:03:45,791 --> 01:03:48,541
Because there's not only one
kind of girl.

874
01:03:50,125 --> 01:03:53,041
What kind of girl are we talking
about?

875
01:03:53,041 --> 01:03:55,166
That's the thing.

876
01:03:55,166 --> 01:03:58,500
She's just so smart, and I'm so
dumb -

877
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:59,875
Hey, hey.

878
01:04:00,833 --> 01:04:02,125
None of that.

879
01:04:02,125 --> 01:04:03,916
Every time I try to impress her,
I end up saying something

880
01:04:03,916 --> 01:04:05,833
stupid.

881
01:04:05,833 --> 01:04:08,041
Well there's your problem!

882
01:04:08,041 --> 01:04:08,541
What?

883
01:04:08,541 --> 01:04:13,375
You're trying to impress her,
show her how great you are.

884
01:04:13,375 --> 01:04:15,083
That works with some women,
but...

885
01:04:15,083 --> 01:04:18,416
You're not interested in just
any girl, are you?

886
01:04:18,708 --> 01:04:19,541
There you go.

887
01:04:19,541 --> 01:04:20,791
With a girl like that,

888
01:04:20,791 --> 01:04:25,291
you gotta show her how great she
is, not you.

889
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:28,708
Support her, encourage her...

890
01:04:29,333 --> 01:04:31,708
Because she is going places.

891
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:35,041
Especially someone like Paloma.

892
01:04:35,041 --> 01:04:38,083
- How...? - Eh, it was pretty
obvious.

893
01:04:41,125 --> 01:04:42,250
Look.

894
01:04:44,583 --> 01:04:47,416
I was going to give this to her,

895
01:04:48,583 --> 01:04:51,125
but I think maybe you should.

896
01:04:54,208 --> 01:04:58,416
Tell her "look what I found and
it made me think of you."

897
01:05:00,375 --> 01:05:03,583
How come you know all this
stuff?

898
01:05:04,541 --> 01:05:08,750
Remember when I said we learn
from our mistakes?

899
01:05:09,958 --> 01:05:12,875
I've made a lot of them.

900
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,541
Take care of it now, you don't
want to lose it -

901
01:05:18,541 --> 01:05:19,416
No!

902
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:25,875
Sorry, it's just that... I keep
important stuff in here.

903
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:31,375
Let me see that bag, Nico.

904
01:05:31,375 --> 01:05:35,791
It just has my school supplies,
a gift from my brother...

905
01:05:35,791 --> 01:05:37,750
- That's all. - Nico!

906
01:05:40,416 --> 01:05:43,083
- No, no, no, - Nico, give it -

907
01:05:43,083 --> 01:05:46,208
Please, we never open it.
Please!

908
01:05:48,041 --> 01:05:50,458
Give me that bag.

909
01:05:50,666 --> 01:05:53,541
If they find out, they'll kill
me.

910
01:05:54,041 --> 01:05:57,875
Please, I'm begging you. Don't
open it.

911
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:01,250
Give it to me, Nico.

912
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:04,708
Will you?

913
01:06:32,875 --> 01:06:34,083
What?

914
01:06:36,916 --> 01:06:38,875
If I open this bag,

915
01:06:39,083 --> 01:06:43,708
am I going to find something no
12-year-old should have,

916
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:46,041
much less bring to school?

917
01:06:46,291 --> 01:06:48,208
I don't know.

918
01:06:49,125 --> 01:06:50,416
Maybe.

919
01:06:51,333 --> 01:06:54,250
Nico, if I find something like
that,

920
01:06:54,541 --> 01:06:58,166
I'll have no choice but to
report it,

921
01:06:58,166 --> 01:06:59,916
and from then on everything will
get much more complicated for

922
01:06:59,916 --> 01:07:02,208
you

923
01:07:03,208 --> 01:07:06,541
So what are you going to do?

924
01:07:06,541 --> 01:07:09,208
That's what you have to tell me.

925
01:07:16,041 --> 01:07:17,875
Good morning.

926
01:07:18,125 --> 01:07:19,625
I looked up your questions,

927
01:07:19,625 --> 01:07:22,875
they're up front with your names
on them.

928
01:07:24,166 --> 01:07:29,916
Nico, I know you've had a lot of
catching up to do,

929
01:07:29,916 --> 01:07:34,583
but out of all my students,
you've made the most progress.

930
01:07:35,375 --> 01:07:38,166
Remember what I said at the top
of the year about taking charge

931
01:07:38,166 --> 01:07:40,750
of your lives?

932
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,708
You have to decide which
direction you want your life to

933
01:07:42,708 --> 01:07:44,750
go.

934
01:07:45,166 --> 01:07:47,750
Do you want it to go this way?

935
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:51,083
or this way.

936
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,208
You can't have both.

937
01:07:59,750 --> 01:08:01,333
Almost on time.

938
01:08:01,333 --> 01:08:03,541
At least you're making progress.

939
01:08:03,541 --> 01:08:07,458
Today, we're having Rosita's
dance presentation.

940
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:09,500
It's going to be fantastic.

941
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:14,416
But before we begin, it's game
time.

942
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,083
Pay attention.

943
01:08:17,083 --> 01:08:19,791
There was a famous mathematician
named

944
01:08:19,791 --> 01:08:23,041
Carl Friedrich Gauss.

945
01:08:23,041 --> 01:08:25,916
In 1777, when he was a kid,

946
01:08:25,916 --> 01:08:28,000
his teacher wanted to keep all
his students busy,

947
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:34,083
so he asked them to add up all
the numbers from 1 to 100.

948
01:08:34,875 --> 01:08:38,166
This was supposed to take them
hours,

949
01:08:38,166 --> 01:08:42,083
but Gauss answered immediately.

950
01:08:42,083 --> 01:08:45,541
Can anyone tell me how he did
it?

951
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:52,250
Uh, Team 2? Paloma?

952
01:08:57,833 --> 01:08:59,375
Is it...

953
01:08:59,375 --> 01:09:00,750
5050?

954
01:09:06,083 --> 01:09:08,291
How did you get that?

955
01:09:09,208 --> 01:09:14,458
I added 100 plus 1... 101.

956
01:09:14,666 --> 01:09:17,708
99 plus 2, 101.

957
01:09:17,708 --> 01:09:20,166
98 plus 3, 101.

958
01:09:20,166 --> 01:09:23,875
In total, there are 50 pairs of
101.

959
01:09:28,708 --> 01:09:31,083
Team 2 gets a point.

960
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:40,583
I need to report an incident.

961
01:09:43,166 --> 01:09:46,750
- Are we done here? - It seems
we are.

962
01:09:47,541 --> 01:09:49,916
What happened?

963
01:09:52,083 --> 01:09:55,291
A student may have brought
contraband to school.

964
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:57,500
"May have brought"?

965
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:59,750
Yeah, I'm not certain.

966
01:10:00,125 --> 01:10:03,000
Who's the offender?

967
01:10:04,083 --> 01:10:05,083
Me.

968
01:10:06,166 --> 01:10:06,500
Come again?

969
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:09,458
Yes, maybe I should've reported
the student.

970
01:10:09,458 --> 01:10:12,000
Isn't that what you're doing
right now?

971
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,083
Yes.

972
01:10:13,083 --> 01:10:13,208
Yes.
No.

973
01:10:13,208 --> 01:10:14,875
No.

974
01:10:15,125 --> 01:10:17,708
No, because I'm reporting
myself.

975
01:10:18,375 --> 01:10:18,875
For what?

976
01:10:18,875 --> 01:10:23,125
For failing to report something
that... Maybe I should have.

977
01:10:23,125 --> 01:10:25,875
I chose not to look in their
bag.

978
01:10:25,875 --> 01:10:27,875
So, who is the student?

979
01:10:27,875 --> 01:10:30,541
No, I can't tell you that.

980
01:10:30,625 --> 01:10:34,208
Because technically, there
hasn't been any violation.

981
01:10:34,208 --> 01:10:38,375
And I want to give them an
opportunity.

982
01:10:38,375 --> 01:10:42,083
I just... I'm not sure I did the
right thing.

983
01:10:42,791 --> 01:10:46,250
This seems more like a
confession than a report.

984
01:10:46,416 --> 01:10:49,833
I didn't do it just for him. Or
her.

985
01:10:49,833 --> 01:10:52,916
It's just that the whole class
is engaging,

986
01:10:52,916 --> 01:10:54,583
the method is working.

987
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:58,708
If I report this student now, I
could lose everyone's trust.

988
01:10:58,708 --> 01:11:03,250
It would ruin the whole thing,
and I don't want to lose them.

989
01:11:04,041 --> 01:11:06,583
So what am I supposed to do?

990
01:11:08,833 --> 01:11:11,291
Tell me I did the right thing?

991
01:11:15,333 --> 01:11:16,375
Sergio,

992
01:11:16,375 --> 01:11:18,458
the only thing that you did...

993
01:11:18,458 --> 01:11:21,208
was confuse the hell out of me.

994
01:11:27,458 --> 01:11:29,458
Can I walk you home?

995
01:11:29,458 --> 01:11:31,083
Don't you live by the beach?

996
01:11:31,083 --> 01:11:34,291
Yes, but I'm taking the long way
today.

997
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:38,041
Besides, you'll be a lot safer
with me...

998
01:11:38,666 --> 01:11:40,416
Suit yourself.

999
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:44,958
You can build your own rocket,

1000
01:11:44,958 --> 01:11:47,583
and you get to experience a
zero-gravity chamber.

1001
01:11:47,583 --> 01:11:51,083
And look, there's also a
simulation of a failed launch,

1002
01:11:51,083 --> 01:11:53,333
where you have to regain
control.

1003
01:11:53,333 --> 01:11:54,375
And get this:

1004
01:11:54,375 --> 01:11:59,000
Three students have become real
astronauts.

1005
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,291
- Sergio told me that - - Wait a
second.

1006
01:12:01,291 --> 01:12:03,750
Sergio gave you this?

1007
01:12:09,083 --> 01:12:11,083
Wanna see something?

1008
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:20,666
- Are you okay, Papa? - Yes,
don't worry.

1009
01:12:20,666 --> 01:12:23,875
I'm just a little beat today.

1010
01:12:24,125 --> 01:12:27,000
Who's this? Good afternoon. I'm
Nico.

1011
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,083
We're partners on a science
project.

1012
01:12:30,083 --> 01:12:33,125
Let me take my bag inside, I'll
be right back.

1013
01:12:37,291 --> 01:12:39,416
Eh, how are you, sir?

1014
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,750
Okay.

1015
01:12:53,666 --> 01:12:55,041
Come on.

1016
01:13:01,083 --> 01:13:04,875
- Sorry about the smell. - What
smell?

1017
01:13:08,166 --> 01:13:09,583
Here.

1018
01:13:12,583 --> 01:13:15,125
Where did you get that?

1019
01:13:15,708 --> 01:13:18,375
I... found it.

1020
01:13:18,375 --> 01:13:20,750
- Whoa. - You haven't seen
anything yet.

1021
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,208
Here.

1022
01:13:22,208 --> 01:13:24,750
- What's that? - My tripod.

1023
01:13:28,583 --> 01:13:31,166
Doesn't it have to be nighttime?

1024
01:13:34,041 --> 01:13:35,708
Look.

1025
01:13:37,625 --> 01:13:40,416
- Where? - There.

1026
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:43,250
Where the ocean meets the sky.

1027
01:13:43,625 --> 01:13:44,916
What - what's that?

1028
01:13:44,916 --> 01:13:49,125
SpaceX. It's the launch site in
Boca Chica, Texas.

1029
01:13:49,125 --> 01:13:53,416
Soon the world's biggest rockets
will be launched from there.

1030
01:13:55,041 --> 01:13:57,291
And we can watch them from right
here.

1031
01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:23,708
They're asleep.

1032
01:14:28,041 --> 01:14:30,041
What are you reading?

1033
01:14:30,416 --> 01:14:32,833
About moral dilemmas.

1034
01:14:32,833 --> 01:14:36,583
I don't understand a lot of it,
but it's very interesting.

1035
01:14:37,083 --> 01:14:38,583
Like...

1036
01:14:38,583 --> 01:14:42,041
let's say you're the captain of
a sinking ship.

1037
01:14:42,041 --> 01:14:46,958
You have 30 passengers, but the
lifeboat only holds 15.

1038
01:14:46,958 --> 01:14:50,208
How do you choose who to save,
and why?

1039
01:14:50,291 --> 01:14:54,958
- What class is that for? - It's
not for school.

1040
01:14:54,958 --> 01:14:58,041
I got it from the university.
For myself.

1041
01:14:58,041 --> 01:14:59,958
Wait, what?

1042
01:14:59,958 --> 01:15:04,166
That library is amazing, you
should see it.

1043
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:07,125
I thought I'd like to study
philosophy,

1044
01:15:07,125 --> 01:15:11,208
but after seeing all those
books... I dunno.

1045
01:15:11,333 --> 01:15:15,750
But I want to be a professor,
that's for sure.

1046
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:18,583
Philosophy?

1047
01:15:19,958 --> 01:15:21,583
Professor?

1048
01:15:22,375 --> 01:15:24,208
Honey...

1049
01:15:25,125 --> 01:15:29,083
You're not even going back to
school next year.

1050
01:15:29,166 --> 01:15:33,333
I have to work, who's going to
look after your baby brother,

1051
01:15:33,333 --> 01:15:35,708
huh?

1052
01:15:36,750 --> 01:15:43,166
Look, if it means a lot to you
and you really want to,

1053
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:46,041
I'm sure you can get back to it
after, once he's in

1054
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:48,583
kindergarten.

1055
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,041
Let's go, Paloma.

1056
01:16:42,833 --> 01:16:47,208
Oh, there you are! Special
presentation today.

1057
01:16:47,208 --> 01:16:51,666
Your class gets the first slot.
9:00 am. Computer lab.

1058
01:16:51,666 --> 01:16:53,083
Okay.

1059
01:16:53,458 --> 01:16:55,916
The District sent a technician.

1060
01:16:55,916 --> 01:16:57,958
He'll show some basic concept to
the kids

1061
01:16:57,958 --> 01:17:00,500
He'll explain to them how a
computer works.

1062
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:01,333
Really? Yes, he's setting up
now.

1063
01:17:01,333 --> 01:17:03,416
- Really? - Yes, he's setting up
now.

1064
01:17:04,458 --> 01:17:06,083
What happened?

1065
01:17:07,041 --> 01:17:09,875
I insisted, I pressed.

1066
01:17:11,166 --> 01:17:13,250
I could kiss you.

1067
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:14,291
Please don't...

1068
01:17:14,291 --> 01:17:16,416
I haven't brushed my teeth.

1069
01:17:18,375 --> 01:17:20,250
See you there.

1070
01:17:21,375 --> 01:17:22,750
Nico!

1071
01:17:23,666 --> 01:17:27,125
- How did it go? - I think...
good?

1072
01:17:38,666 --> 01:17:41,708
- What's this? - A little gift.

1073
01:17:41,708 --> 01:17:44,166
Call it a Christmas bonus...

1074
01:17:45,291 --> 01:17:49,708
I'm not big on tests, much less
practice ones.

1075
01:17:50,625 --> 01:17:52,708
You see the date?

1076
01:17:56,083 --> 01:17:58,583
2012? But that's this year.

1077
01:17:58,583 --> 01:18:02,583
It's not a practice test. It's
the real deal.

1078
01:18:02,958 --> 01:18:06,208
- Where did you get this? - It's
everywhere.

1079
01:18:06,208 --> 01:18:09,041
You just have to know where to
look.

1080
01:18:09,541 --> 01:18:11,416
Thanks but...

1081
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:12,583
No.

1082
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:16,916
It's ok. We're all together on
this.

1083
01:18:16,916 --> 01:18:21,125
You can keep doing your thing if
you prepare them with this

1084
01:18:21,125 --> 01:18:23,541
the other teachers won't be so
bothered by your little...

1085
01:18:23,541 --> 01:18:25,750
experiments.

1086
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:30,083
Thanks, but... Count me out.

1087
01:18:31,166 --> 01:18:34,250
Thing is, we're evaluated as a
whole.

1088
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:39,416
If your students do poorly, you
bring us all down.

1089
01:18:39,583 --> 01:18:42,541
So you kind of... have to be in.

1090
01:18:42,541 --> 01:18:43,541
What about the kids?

1091
01:18:43,541 --> 01:18:44,666
They'll have no idea.

1092
01:18:44,666 --> 01:18:48,166
If they excel, they graduate. If
they fail, they graduate.

1093
01:18:48,166 --> 01:18:50,541
No matter what happens, they
graduate. That's how it's always

1094
01:18:50,541 --> 01:18:52,000
been.

1095
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,291
The only difference is whether
we get a bonus along the way or

1096
01:18:55,291 --> 01:18:56,125
not.

1097
01:18:56,125 --> 01:18:58,166
No, the only difference

1098
01:18:58,166 --> 01:19:01,291
is whether or not we teach them
to cheat.

1099
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:03,583
That's the difference.

1100
01:19:24,375 --> 01:19:27,041
Laptops? Even better!

1101
01:19:28,583 --> 01:19:31,500
- Good morning. - Morning!

1102
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:36,416
Believing computers are a vital
part of the modern economy...

1103
01:19:39,458 --> 01:19:42,250
- Eh, the government of
Matamoros - - Cut to the chase,

1104
01:19:42,250 --> 01:19:44,583
man.

1105
01:19:45,958 --> 01:19:48,083
Okay.

1106
01:19:48,666 --> 01:19:54,041
This is a CPU, or Central
Processing Unit.

1107
01:19:54,125 --> 01:19:56,708
It's the brain of the
computer...

1108
01:19:56,708 --> 01:20:01,208
The CPU stores the data and
executes

1109
01:20:01,208 --> 01:20:04,791
the operations that make a
computer work...

1110
01:20:04,791 --> 01:20:09,250
Did you know that a computer can
execute up to...

1111
01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:14,416
four million commands per
second...

1112
01:20:20,208 --> 01:20:21,291
Hey!

1113
01:20:22,791 --> 01:20:25,750
- What are you doing? - Excuse
me?

1114
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:29,250
I assume you gave this to my
daughter?

1115
01:20:29,833 --> 01:20:32,250
You must be Paloma's father.

1116
01:20:33,083 --> 01:20:35,166
Twelve hundred dollars.

1117
01:20:35,166 --> 01:20:38,250
- I don't make that in a year. -
No, no, uh...

1118
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:42,500
They offer scholarships, the
school would recommend her.

1119
01:20:42,625 --> 01:20:45,166
Paloma has a good shot.

1120
01:20:45,166 --> 01:20:48,625
We could hold a fundraiser for
her travel expenses.

1121
01:20:48,625 --> 01:20:51,625
- I'm sure that - - Look,
Maestro.

1122
01:20:51,625 --> 01:20:52,125
I may be poor.

1123
01:20:52,125 --> 01:20:55,750
I've worked all my life sifting
through trash,

1124
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:56,958
but I'm no beggar.

1125
01:20:56,958 --> 01:21:00,583
Oh, no, no. That's not what I
meant.

1126
01:21:01,083 --> 01:21:02,666
Look.

1127
01:21:02,666 --> 01:21:06,125
I know this may seem like a big
stretch for you,

1128
01:21:06,750 --> 01:21:09,000
but Paloma isn't just any
student.

1129
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,708
- She can get that scholarship.
- And then, what?

1130
01:21:12,708 --> 01:21:15,041
When she goes to this "space
camp" and sees all that crazy

1131
01:21:15,041 --> 01:21:17,083
stuff,

1132
01:21:17,083 --> 01:21:20,083
And then returns here? To
reality?

1133
01:21:20,916 --> 01:21:21,791
You know...

1134
01:21:21,791 --> 01:21:25,208
You blast these kids off like
rocket ships into space,

1135
01:21:25,208 --> 01:21:27,750
after packing their heads with
all these ideas.

1136
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:30,750
But when they leave your class
and return to the real world,

1137
01:21:30,750 --> 01:21:32,375
when they come crashing back
down to earth, where will you be

1138
01:21:32,375 --> 01:21:34,125
then?

1139
01:21:34,125 --> 01:21:39,208
Will you be here to catch them
and tell them to keep trying?

1140
01:21:39,375 --> 01:21:40,208
No...

1141
01:21:40,208 --> 01:21:44,875
You'll be filling another bunch
of heads with your crazy ideas,

1142
01:21:44,875 --> 01:21:47,583
reminding them of what they
can't have,

1143
01:21:47,583 --> 01:21:49,541
what they can never be.

1144
01:21:49,541 --> 01:21:51,083
Papa?

1145
01:21:51,958 --> 01:21:53,875
Please, Maestro.

1146
01:21:54,416 --> 01:21:57,041
Don't do that to my daughter.

1147
01:21:57,625 --> 01:21:59,250
Come on, Paloma.

1148
01:22:34,083 --> 01:22:36,958
- You can't go in! - Excuse me.

1149
01:22:36,958 --> 01:22:39,125
- I know you're busy. - I tried
to stop him.

1150
01:22:39,125 --> 01:22:41,875
- Sorry to interrupt, but - -
Who are you?

1151
01:22:41,875 --> 01:22:43,708
I'm Sergio Juárez Correa.

1152
01:22:43,708 --> 01:22:46,666
I teach at Escuela Primaria José
Urbina López.

1153
01:22:46,666 --> 01:22:49,083
I wanted to talk to you about...

1154
01:22:49,375 --> 01:22:52,083
About the situation with...

1155
01:22:52,083 --> 01:22:54,041
with our computers.

1156
01:22:54,583 --> 01:22:56,208
It's fine, Martha.

1157
01:22:56,208 --> 01:23:01,916
We always make time for our
soldiers on the front line.

1158
01:23:03,083 --> 01:23:06,291
- Interesting choice of words. -
Pardon me?

1159
01:23:06,291 --> 01:23:09,375
Soldier. Front lines...

1160
01:23:09,375 --> 01:23:12,708
As if I were at war, fighting an
enemy.

1161
01:23:12,708 --> 01:23:14,458
But no. I...

1162
01:23:15,083 --> 01:23:16,708
I spend all day with...

1163
01:23:16,708 --> 01:23:18,166
Children.

1164
01:23:20,916 --> 01:23:22,708
So, tell me...

1165
01:23:23,291 --> 01:23:25,583
How can I help you?

1166
01:23:54,125 --> 01:23:56,083
Nacho asked about you today.

1167
01:23:56,083 --> 01:23:58,750
"When is the pretty boy going to
start?"

1168
01:23:58,750 --> 01:24:02,416
Now that school's winding down,
he wants to show you the ropes.

1169
01:24:04,541 --> 01:24:06,083
What is it?

1170
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,041
Do you see out there?

1171
01:24:09,041 --> 01:24:11,000
You can't tell where the ocean
ends

1172
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,708
and the sky begins.

1173
01:24:14,541 --> 01:24:17,375
Did you know that right now,
technically,

1174
01:24:17,375 --> 01:24:20,250
we're standing in outer space?

1175
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,208
What?

1176
01:24:23,208 --> 01:24:25,916
Yeah, it comes all the way down
to here.

1177
01:24:25,916 --> 01:24:30,166
What we think of as the sky is
just a layer of gas.

1178
01:24:30,166 --> 01:24:34,583
It doesn't feel like there's
anything, it seems empty,

1179
01:24:35,083 --> 01:24:37,333
but it actually has mass -

1180
01:24:37,333 --> 01:24:39,000
like weight -

1181
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,416
and it's always being pulled
towards Earth.

1182
01:24:42,833 --> 01:24:44,875
It's trapped here.

1183
01:24:45,291 --> 01:24:47,250
Just like we are.

1184
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:56,208
- Hey, I'm not going to work for
Nacho. - Are you serious?

1185
01:24:56,208 --> 01:24:59,041
But you hate school. What
happened?

1186
01:24:59,041 --> 01:25:02,958
I don't know. I just... like it.

1187
01:25:02,958 --> 01:25:05,833
There's this teacher,

1188
01:25:05,833 --> 01:25:08,083
who does things differently.

1189
01:25:08,083 --> 01:25:11,916
With him, I think I could
actually be smart.

1190
01:25:13,791 --> 01:25:15,666
And, there's this girl...

1191
01:25:15,666 --> 01:25:19,083
Ha! The truth comes out.

1192
01:25:19,083 --> 01:25:21,708
Check out our little Don Juan!

1193
01:25:22,458 --> 01:25:23,625
Listen...

1194
01:25:23,625 --> 01:25:25,041
If you had a shot to do
something else, I'd want you to

1195
01:25:25,041 --> 01:25:27,541
take it.

1196
01:25:27,541 --> 01:25:30,666
But with Nacho, once you're in,
you're never out.

1197
01:25:30,666 --> 01:25:33,875
But I was never really in...

1198
01:25:34,208 --> 01:25:35,708
Right?

1199
01:25:44,791 --> 01:25:47,291
Hey! Need a ride?

1200
01:25:48,291 --> 01:25:52,041
I was enjoying the walk, but
sure.

1201
01:26:02,708 --> 01:26:06,708
Your car in the shop? Yeah.

1202
01:26:07,125 --> 01:26:08,541
Forever.

1203
01:26:09,083 --> 01:26:12,083
I traded it for something more
useful.

1204
01:26:12,083 --> 01:26:14,583
Is that what I think it is?

1205
01:26:15,916 --> 01:26:18,208
Now you'll see what they can do.

1206
01:26:18,208 --> 01:26:23,000
- You didn't have to do that. -
Oh, I did.

1207
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:26,791
- I'm sorry, I really thought -
- It's okay, I know.

1208
01:26:26,791 --> 01:26:30,750
In fact, I really appreciate
your effort.

1209
01:26:32,125 --> 01:26:34,416
Your wife didn't get mad?

1210
01:26:37,083 --> 01:26:39,750
- Are you married? - No.

1211
01:26:40,250 --> 01:26:41,041
Good, because...

1212
01:26:41,041 --> 01:26:44,416
I think I'll be staying at your
place for a while.

1213
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:00,750
His approach is unorthodox, but
the results are compelling.

1214
01:27:01,041 --> 01:27:02,583
Yes, I'm sure.

1215
01:27:08,166 --> 01:27:11,375
We have visitors. To what do we
owe the honor?

1216
01:27:11,375 --> 01:27:13,750
I take it you know each other -

1217
01:27:13,750 --> 01:27:15,166
What are you doing?

1218
01:27:15,166 --> 01:27:16,750
Meditating.

1219
01:27:16,750 --> 01:27:20,541
We were having a discussion and
things got pretty intense,

1220
01:27:20,541 --> 01:27:24,750
so we were taking a moment to
cool down.

1221
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,166
Don't mind me. Please, continue.

1222
01:27:27,166 --> 01:27:29,041
I'm just here to observe.

1223
01:27:29,041 --> 01:27:31,083
What were you discussing?

1224
01:27:32,041 --> 01:27:35,083
We were discussing... morality.

1225
01:27:35,625 --> 01:27:37,041
Morality?

1226
01:27:37,041 --> 01:27:40,291
That's not a subject we're
familiar with.

1227
01:27:40,291 --> 01:27:44,875
According to the lesson plan...
March 20th...

1228
01:27:44,875 --> 01:27:48,833
you should be preparing for the
ENLACE test.

1229
01:27:48,833 --> 01:27:52,750
Yeah, but Lupita has taken an
interest in philosophy.

1230
01:27:52,750 --> 01:27:55,375
Philosophy? And she was sharing
with the class

1231
01:27:55,375 --> 01:27:58,208
some of the things she has
learned.

1232
01:27:58,625 --> 01:28:01,041
Last year, in the fifth grade,

1233
01:28:01,041 --> 01:28:06,041
this class's scores were among
the worst in the nation.

1234
01:28:06,041 --> 01:28:08,666
I find it strange you have time
to do anything but prepare for

1235
01:28:08,666 --> 01:28:11,083
the test.

1236
01:28:11,083 --> 01:28:13,041
Well, like I said.

1237
01:28:13,041 --> 01:28:15,875
Someone told Lupita she was far
too young

1238
01:28:15,875 --> 01:28:17,416
to read about philosophy.

1239
01:28:17,416 --> 01:28:19,875
So, we were trying to see if it
could answer some difficult

1240
01:28:19,875 --> 01:28:22,083
questions.

1241
01:28:23,250 --> 01:28:25,250
Like which?

1242
01:28:27,458 --> 01:28:29,250
I wanted to know what John
Stuart Mill would say about

1243
01:28:29,250 --> 01:28:31,666
abortion.

1244
01:28:31,666 --> 01:28:32,541
Abortion?

1245
01:28:32,541 --> 01:28:37,125
- And what do you think he'd
say? - Well...

1246
01:28:38,083 --> 01:28:44,041
If we want the greatest good for
the greatest number of people,

1247
01:28:44,041 --> 01:28:46,791
I think that if you're
struggling to afford rent and

1248
01:28:46,791 --> 01:28:48,958
food,

1249
01:28:48,958 --> 01:28:51,875
It's better not to bring more
children into the world who are

1250
01:28:51,875 --> 01:28:54,000
only going to suffer.

1251
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,916
And that would also cause more
suffering for others.

1252
01:28:57,916 --> 01:28:59,000
So, yes.

1253
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:03,083
There are cases where abortion
might be the right thing to do.

1254
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:05,000
My god.

1255
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:09,416
So, how do you feel about this
conclusion?

1256
01:29:10,958 --> 01:29:15,125
Well, I think about my own
siblings.

1257
01:29:15,625 --> 01:29:19,125
Sometimes they are a lot of
work,

1258
01:29:19,125 --> 01:29:24,583
but I also don't like imagining
them not having been born.

1259
01:29:25,958 --> 01:29:27,750
I don't know.

1260
01:29:28,958 --> 01:29:31,250
It's very complicated.

1261
01:29:31,333 --> 01:29:32,125
But it's cool.

1262
01:29:32,125 --> 01:29:35,833
We all agreed that condoms are
the obvious answer.

1263
01:29:35,833 --> 01:29:38,875
- Condoms?! - Well, not everyone
agrees.

1264
01:29:38,875 --> 01:29:42,583
In fact, we had quite a debate
about that, didn't we?

1265
01:29:42,875 --> 01:29:47,000
According to Stuart Mill,
something can be good or bad

1266
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,416
depending on the situation.

1267
01:29:49,416 --> 01:29:52,041
Is there something that in his
view

1268
01:29:52,041 --> 01:29:55,208
would always be immoral in every
case?

1269
01:29:55,583 --> 01:29:59,583
Anything that hurts many for the
benefit of a few.

1270
01:29:59,791 --> 01:30:00,333
Like what?

1271
01:30:00,333 --> 01:30:05,125
Like if someone steals something
that is meant for everybody?

1272
01:30:05,125 --> 01:30:09,750
Very good, Nico. So something
like...

1273
01:30:11,208 --> 01:30:12,875
Corruption?

1274
01:30:14,208 --> 01:30:19,041
Given you have the time to
discuss such advanced subjects

1275
01:30:19,041 --> 01:30:19,333
in class,

1276
01:30:19,333 --> 01:30:24,875
You must have total command of
the basic sixth grade skills

1277
01:30:25,166 --> 01:30:27,208
You, tell me...

1278
01:30:27,208 --> 01:30:31,000
What's the square root of 256?

1279
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:31,041
What's the square root of 256?
What is that supposed to show?

1280
01:30:31,041 --> 01:30:33,166
What is that supposed to show?

1281
01:30:33,166 --> 01:30:38,583
No? With whom was Mexico at war
in 1846?

1282
01:30:39,041 --> 01:30:43,208
He hasn't gone over that yet,
he's -

1283
01:30:43,625 --> 01:30:47,125
Explain Darwin's Theory of
Evolution.

1284
01:30:47,333 --> 01:30:49,125
Hold on -

1285
01:30:54,125 --> 01:30:55,833
As I suspected...

1286
01:30:55,833 --> 01:30:58,750
This child lacks the basic
knowledge expected from a sixth

1287
01:30:58,750 --> 01:31:01,083
grader.

1288
01:31:01,083 --> 01:31:04,458
Mr. Juárez, he's the
definition...

1289
01:31:04,458 --> 01:31:06,041
...of an ignoramus.

1290
01:31:06,041 --> 01:31:09,000
Now wait - Hey Nico!

1291
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,791
And undisciplined too!

1292
01:31:11,791 --> 01:31:14,333
What's wrong with you? Why did
you do that?

1293
01:31:14,333 --> 01:31:16,000
To me, say what you want, but
don't you talk to the kids that

1294
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,041
way.

1295
01:31:19,083 --> 01:31:22,125
The square root of 256 is 16.

1296
01:31:22,208 --> 01:31:26,125
Mexico fought the U.S. in 1846.

1297
01:31:26,583 --> 01:31:31,291
Darwin's theory of Evolution is
the survival of the fittest.

1298
01:31:36,416 --> 01:31:40,083
Thank you, Mr. Juárez. See me in
the Director's Office.

1299
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,333
I've been thinking about our
game from the first day,

1300
01:32:02,333 --> 01:32:04,750
remember?

1301
01:32:05,125 --> 01:32:07,541
The boats and the passengers?

1302
01:32:07,541 --> 01:32:10,208
There's an obvious solution.

1303
01:32:10,541 --> 01:32:13,958
You shouldn't sell more tickets
than there are spaces in the

1304
01:32:13,958 --> 01:32:16,125
lifeboats.

1305
01:32:28,208 --> 01:32:31,208
- Wait, Sergio. - I bet he's
taking bribes from those

1306
01:32:31,208 --> 01:32:32,125
assholes!

1307
01:32:32,125 --> 01:32:34,125
Wait, Sergio!

1308
01:32:34,583 --> 01:32:37,875
I asked you not to kick the
hornet's nest, and what did you

1309
01:32:37,875 --> 01:32:38,333
do!?

1310
01:32:38,333 --> 01:32:41,208
Abortion? Condoms? Corruption?!

1311
01:32:41,208 --> 01:32:44,583
I can't ask my students to be
fearless learners, to do

1312
01:32:44,583 --> 01:32:45,166
whatever it takes -

1313
01:32:45,166 --> 01:32:48,375
to go wherever their inquiries
take them -

1314
01:32:48,375 --> 01:32:49,708
And then what?

1315
01:32:49,708 --> 01:32:52,166
Turn into a bootlicker right in
front of them?

1316
01:32:52,166 --> 01:32:53,958
Think of the big picture

1317
01:32:53,958 --> 01:32:57,000
What matters is that they keep
you as their teacher.

1318
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:00,041
So what if you have to lick a
few boots?

1319
01:33:00,125 --> 01:33:01,541
Are you serious?

1320
01:33:05,625 --> 01:33:08,458
Mr. Director? I'm waiting...

1321
01:33:08,458 --> 01:33:10,583
Right away, sir.

1322
01:33:16,625 --> 01:33:19,041
Mr. Juárez...

1323
01:33:19,041 --> 01:33:24,208
I must say I was very disturbed
to receive numerous complaints

1324
01:33:24,208 --> 01:33:27,125
that your kids aren't being
prepared for the ENLACE test,

1325
01:33:27,125 --> 01:33:31,333
But I didn't imagine the
situation would be this bad.

1326
01:33:31,333 --> 01:33:34,875
So you are hereby suspended for
two weeks.

1327
01:33:34,875 --> 01:33:35,083
What?!

1328
01:33:35,083 --> 01:33:37,250
Until after your class has been
prepared for the ENLACE test,

1329
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:40,250
For which you have obviously so
little regard -

1330
01:33:40,250 --> 01:33:41,541
Look...

1331
01:33:42,250 --> 01:33:45,333
You're right, I won't deny it.

1332
01:33:45,333 --> 01:33:47,166
I think it's a useless test.

1333
01:33:47,166 --> 01:33:49,416
but don't take that out on the
kids.

1334
01:33:49,416 --> 01:33:52,208
OK I'll do it, I'll prepare
them.

1335
01:33:52,208 --> 01:33:55,083
For the next two weeks, that's
all we'll do: prepare for the

1336
01:33:55,083 --> 01:33:57,208
ENLACE.

1337
01:33:57,208 --> 01:34:01,250
But please... don't suspend me.

1338
01:34:01,416 --> 01:34:03,666
To bring in anyone else but me
to prepare them would just be...

1339
01:34:03,666 --> 01:34:06,208
stupidity.

1340
01:34:06,708 --> 01:34:10,208
You can thank your Director that
this is only a suspension,

1341
01:34:10,208 --> 01:34:12,041
and not a permanent dismissal.

1342
01:34:12,041 --> 01:34:15,166
But to be honest, I'm starting
to reconsider my decision.

1343
01:34:15,166 --> 01:34:18,083
That won't be necessary.

1344
01:34:18,708 --> 01:34:20,500
That won't be necessary.

1345
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:22,708
Anything else to add?

1346
01:34:23,125 --> 01:34:24,708
No.

1347
01:34:25,875 --> 01:34:28,083
Good day, Professors.

1348
01:34:36,291 --> 01:34:40,083
This is insane, Chucho.

1349
01:34:40,083 --> 01:34:44,041
Did you know that in my class,
right here in this school,

1350
01:34:44,041 --> 01:34:47,291
there's a girl who I'm sure is a
certifiable genius?

1351
01:34:47,291 --> 01:34:49,958
The only thing you knew about
her before I got here was that

1352
01:34:49,958 --> 01:34:52,583
"she could apply herself more."

1353
01:34:52,750 --> 01:34:54,291
Really?

1354
01:34:54,291 --> 01:34:58,166
How many kids in this country
could be like her?

1355
01:34:58,166 --> 01:35:01,083
But as long as we tolerate this
deliberate ignorance, we will

1356
01:35:01,083 --> 01:35:03,541
never know.

1357
01:35:03,541 --> 01:35:05,166
I'm sorry, Sergio.

1358
01:35:05,166 --> 01:35:07,250
My hands are tied. Yeah, yeah.

1359
01:35:07,250 --> 01:35:09,458
Consider it a vacation.

1360
01:35:09,458 --> 01:35:12,708
Go spend some time with your
wife and baby.

1361
01:35:34,375 --> 01:35:36,291
Hey, you okay?

1362
01:35:47,625 --> 01:35:50,166
You know? You're not stupid.

1363
01:35:50,166 --> 01:35:54,583
Or an ignoramus, or whatever
that man called you.

1364
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,416
I mean it.

1365
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:59,041
You always come up with the most
clever things to say, so

1366
01:35:59,041 --> 01:36:01,000
quickly...

1367
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,583
I could never do that.

1368
01:36:29,458 --> 01:36:32,416
There's the pretty boy!

1369
01:36:33,666 --> 01:36:38,000
Chepe says you're confused about
who you work for?

1370
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:41,875
I couldn't believe it, so I
wanted to see for myself...

1371
01:36:42,625 --> 01:36:45,875
So? Do you work for me, or not?

1372
01:36:51,875 --> 01:36:54,708
It suddenly occurs to me that
the reason you're confused

1373
01:36:54,708 --> 01:36:59,083
is because we never gave you a
proper welcome to the family.

1374
01:36:59,083 --> 01:37:02,083
A real initiation, you know?

1375
01:37:07,041 --> 01:37:08,125
Who's this?

1376
01:37:08,125 --> 01:37:10,250
She's no one, just a friend.

1377
01:37:10,333 --> 01:37:12,083
Go home.

1378
01:37:12,708 --> 01:37:15,083
- Hang on, love. - Hey!

1379
01:37:15,083 --> 01:37:16,875
- What's going on? - Are you a
virgin?

1380
01:37:16,875 --> 01:37:17,958
- What?! - Nacho, don't!

1381
01:37:17,958 --> 01:37:20,833
- She'll do. - She's just a kid,
man!

1382
01:37:20,833 --> 01:37:21,041
Hey!

1383
01:37:21,041 --> 01:37:23,916
Look at your brother, trying to
act tough!

1384
01:37:23,916 --> 01:37:26,958
They're just kids, man!

1385
01:37:26,958 --> 01:37:29,208
- Wait, Nico! - What the fuck?!

1386
01:37:58,333 --> 01:38:00,708
Lupe... Lupe!

1387
01:38:01,125 --> 01:38:02,875
Are you okay?!

1388
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,708
Are you all okay?

1389
01:38:18,958 --> 01:38:20,416
Are you ok?

1390
01:38:20,791 --> 01:38:23,125
Paloma, are you all right?!

1391
01:38:26,375 --> 01:38:28,083
Nico...

1392
01:38:28,083 --> 01:38:29,583
Nico...

1393
01:39:33,458 --> 01:39:37,541
Carlos ate 3/8 of the pizza,

1394
01:39:37,541 --> 01:39:42,541
whereas Ricardo ate 1/4 of the
same pizza.

1395
01:39:42,541 --> 01:39:48,750
How much of the pizza did Carlos
and Ricardo eat?

1396
01:39:49,083 --> 01:39:51,916
Anyone?

1397
01:40:07,708 --> 01:40:09,625
Good morning, Laura.

1398
01:40:09,625 --> 01:40:11,083
What a surprise.

1399
01:40:11,083 --> 01:40:14,208
Maybe you can get him out of
bed.

1400
01:40:16,166 --> 01:40:17,583
Excuse me.

1401
01:40:33,041 --> 01:40:35,291
Can we talk for a minute?

1402
01:40:39,958 --> 01:40:42,666
Sergio, the ENLACE test is
tomorrow.

1403
01:40:42,666 --> 01:40:46,250
That means your suspension is
over.

1404
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:51,250
We're understaffed, we could use
your help.

1405
01:40:52,791 --> 01:40:55,750
We haven't heard anything from
you.

1406
01:40:57,375 --> 01:41:00,583
I need to know if you're coming
back.

1407
01:41:04,750 --> 01:41:10,000
You know I couldn't do anything
about what happened.

1408
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,583
You know I was against it.

1409
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:23,541
Sergio, open up!

1410
01:41:25,208 --> 01:41:29,083
I'm not leaving. I'm staying
right here.

1411
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:33,041
I'm going to eat your food, crap
in your toilet...

1412
01:41:33,208 --> 01:41:37,416
Whatever it takes, I'm not
leaving until you come out.

1413
01:41:42,416 --> 01:41:44,291
Sergio...

1414
01:41:44,416 --> 01:41:47,583
You can't walk out on these
children.

1415
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:51,125
They're traumatized enough as it
is.

1416
01:41:53,041 --> 01:41:57,208
Maybe it's the best way to
prepare them for the future.

1417
01:41:57,583 --> 01:42:00,083
- Hi, how are you? - Go.

1418
01:42:01,041 --> 01:42:02,958
Seriously?

1419
01:42:03,083 --> 01:42:06,291
That's it? You're gonna give up
so easily?

1420
01:42:06,291 --> 01:42:08,041
Yeah, why not?

1421
01:42:08,041 --> 01:42:11,583
You don't want to finish what
you started?

1422
01:42:15,875 --> 01:42:16,791
Sergio...

1423
01:42:16,791 --> 01:42:20,208
You saw for yourself that you
were succeeding.

1424
01:42:21,250 --> 01:42:24,041
Want to know what I succeeded
at?

1425
01:42:24,583 --> 01:42:29,166
I succeeded at getting... they
killed... one of my...

1426
01:42:29,166 --> 01:42:30,166
Look, look...

1427
01:42:30,166 --> 01:42:32,291
If you don't want to, you don't
have to come back...

1428
01:42:32,291 --> 01:42:35,166
Great, so why are you here?

1429
01:42:35,166 --> 01:42:35,208
Great, so why are you here?
For the kids...

1430
01:42:35,208 --> 01:42:36,708
For the kids...

1431
01:42:36,708 --> 01:42:39,250
I want to get my kids back.

1432
01:42:39,250 --> 01:42:41,916
They stopped coming?

1433
01:42:42,083 --> 01:42:44,083
I want them to take the ENLACE
test.

1434
01:42:44,083 --> 01:42:47,250
That fucking test...

1435
01:42:47,625 --> 01:42:49,416
Chucho...

1436
01:42:49,875 --> 01:42:52,083
Look, like I told you...

1437
01:42:55,083 --> 01:42:57,208
I failed...

1438
01:42:57,208 --> 01:42:58,416
Them -

1439
01:42:59,041 --> 01:43:00,125
Nico.

1440
01:43:00,125 --> 01:43:01,666
I thought...

1441
01:43:01,666 --> 01:43:04,875
I thought I was doing things the
right way.

1442
01:43:06,166 --> 01:43:07,125
Really, but -

1443
01:43:07,541 --> 01:43:09,916
I should've checked the
backpack...

1444
01:43:09,916 --> 01:43:12,000
No, if I come back they're just
going to end up paying the

1445
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,125
price.

1446
01:43:15,708 --> 01:43:17,583
Again.

1447
01:43:20,125 --> 01:43:24,000
- Sorry... - Wait a minute,
Sergio.

1448
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:24,125
- Sorry... - Wait a minute,
Sergio.
I really do think you were on
the verge of something big with

1449
01:43:24,125 --> 01:43:25,958
I really do think you were on
the verge of something big with

1450
01:43:25,958 --> 01:43:28,083
them.

1451
01:43:30,041 --> 01:43:32,166
I saw it myself.

1452
01:43:32,916 --> 01:43:36,833
I have never seen children
respond like that before. Ever!

1453
01:43:36,833 --> 01:43:40,500
Or make such progress in so
little time.

1454
01:43:40,500 --> 01:43:43,333
But no one gives a shit what we
think of this method.

1455
01:43:43,333 --> 01:43:46,166
No one will care unless we show
measurable results.

1456
01:43:46,166 --> 01:43:48,666
That's what the test is for.

1457
01:43:48,666 --> 01:43:53,041
You said it yourself. Paloma
might be a genius.

1458
01:43:53,166 --> 01:43:55,583
But, how would we know -

1459
01:43:57,750 --> 01:43:59,916
Paloma stopped coming?

1460
01:44:49,125 --> 01:44:51,083
Good afternoon.

1461
01:45:04,250 --> 01:45:06,041
Paloma?

1462
01:45:50,166 --> 01:45:52,625
What are you doing here?

1463
01:45:52,625 --> 01:45:56,208
The director said he'd leave me
alone if

1464
01:45:57,333 --> 01:46:00,291
...I convince you to come back
to school.

1465
01:46:00,541 --> 01:46:02,916
You're not going back?

1466
01:46:05,708 --> 01:46:07,750
I don't know if I can.

1467
01:46:07,750 --> 01:46:09,458
Why not?

1468
01:46:11,041 --> 01:46:13,708
Maybe your dad was right...

1469
01:46:15,541 --> 01:46:18,708
Maybe I've done more harm than
good.

1470
01:46:20,208 --> 01:46:22,250
I can't come back.

1471
01:46:22,791 --> 01:46:26,875
I have to look after him now.
He's sick.

1472
01:46:35,125 --> 01:46:37,416
I'm so sorry, Paloma.

1473
01:46:41,083 --> 01:46:43,208
I'm so sorry.

1474
01:46:44,125 --> 01:46:46,916
But my dad wasn't right...

1475
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:52,541
You told us we had as much
potential as any other kid.

1476
01:46:53,541 --> 01:46:58,416
But what we didn't have before
you, was the belief...

1477
01:46:58,416 --> 01:47:01,166
That we could fulfill it.

1478
01:47:01,166 --> 01:47:03,000
I never could have allowed
myself to imagine the things I

1479
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,583
did in your class.

1480
01:47:05,833 --> 01:47:10,041
About who I could be, what I
could do.

1481
01:47:10,583 --> 01:47:14,000
And that's something I get to
have now.

1482
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:17,250
I wouldn't have that if it
weren't for you.

1483
01:47:18,791 --> 01:47:20,291
And I'll never...

1484
01:47:21,791 --> 01:47:23,750
ever forget that.

1485
01:47:26,541 --> 01:47:29,916
But sometimes, believing is not
enough.

1486
01:47:31,166 --> 01:47:33,208
Sometimes...

1487
01:47:33,958 --> 01:47:36,250
the reality is the reality.

1488
01:47:36,458 --> 01:47:38,541
Look around...

1489
01:47:39,875 --> 01:47:42,708
This is my reality.

1490
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,583
There's no escaping it.

1491
01:47:46,416 --> 01:47:48,416
And people like me...

1492
01:47:50,041 --> 01:47:52,125
like Nico...

1493
01:47:57,083 --> 01:47:59,125
We don't get to escape.

1494
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,083
I understand.

1495
01:48:31,875 --> 01:48:33,750
Mr. Juárez.

1496
01:48:34,458 --> 01:48:36,250
Mr. Noyola.

1497
01:48:37,458 --> 01:48:40,125
Paloma doesn't need this
anymore.

1498
01:48:40,583 --> 01:48:44,958
You should take it back. It
might get damaged here.

1499
01:48:44,958 --> 01:48:48,208
But... what is it?

1500
01:48:49,291 --> 01:48:54,750
She borrowed it from school, for
a science project.

1501
01:48:57,166 --> 01:49:01,041
The school could never afford
something like this.

1502
01:49:08,916 --> 01:49:11,083
She didn't borrow this.

1503
01:49:12,208 --> 01:49:13,375
She made it.

1504
01:49:13,375 --> 01:49:15,208
What...?

1505
01:49:15,583 --> 01:49:17,458
That's impossible.

1506
01:49:17,458 --> 01:49:20,875
Isn't everything impossible
until it is done?

1507
01:49:22,750 --> 01:49:24,708
Wow.

1508
01:49:24,708 --> 01:49:27,916
Paloma is an extraordinary girl,
Mr. Noyola.

1509
01:49:29,166 --> 01:49:32,583
I only wonder if you know just
how extraordinary.

1510
01:49:33,375 --> 01:49:36,083
Don't say that, Maestro.

1511
01:49:36,083 --> 01:49:37,750
This is hers.

1512
01:49:38,583 --> 01:49:39,875
It's hers.

1513
01:49:50,250 --> 01:49:53,041
Can we make one more stop?

1514
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:09,250
Paloma?

1515
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:16,208
You should be resting, Papa.

1516
01:51:17,083 --> 01:51:19,875
Come, sit with me.

1517
01:51:22,041 --> 01:51:24,208
Are you feeling all right?

1518
01:51:56,166 --> 01:51:58,416
It's all gonna be ok.

1519
01:54:08,166 --> 01:54:12,875
That list of yours... have phone
numbers?

1520
01:55:09,166 --> 01:55:10,583
Profe?

1521
01:55:13,125 --> 01:55:14,875
Look at that!

1522
01:55:21,583 --> 01:55:23,083
Over there.

1523
01:55:24,208 --> 01:55:26,250
Sit wherever you like.

1524
01:55:44,833 --> 01:55:47,208
Hurry up, everyone.

1525
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:52,458
- C'mon, guys, we're running
late! - I'm coming!

1526
01:56:05,083 --> 01:56:08,250
How are we doing?

1527
01:56:08,375 --> 01:56:10,708
Just a few more.

1528
01:56:12,375 --> 01:56:13,875
Look.

1529
01:56:14,166 --> 01:56:16,000
- What's up with him? - Due to
numerous reports of

1530
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,166
irregularities,

1531
01:56:18,166 --> 01:56:20,625
they decided to change this
year's test.

1532
01:56:20,625 --> 01:56:26,416
Perhaps they got a lot of tips
from concerned citizens.

1533
01:56:28,083 --> 01:56:32,083
At least we're all on a level
playing field.

1534
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,541
What?

1535
01:56:38,500 --> 01:56:41,458
Everyone take your seats...

1536
01:56:41,458 --> 01:56:45,000
Do not touch the materials in
front of you until the test

1537
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,416
begins.

1538
01:58:02,541 --> 01:58:06,083
Ok everyone, let's quiet down
please.

1539
01:58:06,625 --> 01:58:09,166
We're about to begin.

1540
01:58:11,916 --> 01:58:14,208
All right guys, listen; real
quick.

1541
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:18,791
This test measures how much you
know, okay?

1542
01:58:18,791 --> 01:58:21,375
Maybe... this year I didn't
teach you everything you need to

1543
01:58:21,375 --> 01:58:23,750
know.

1544
01:58:24,375 --> 01:58:26,166
But you did learn how to think.

1545
01:58:26,166 --> 01:58:29,208
So, there might be some things
that you don't recognize...

1546
01:58:29,208 --> 01:58:33,208
but there's nothing in this test
you can't figure out.

1547
01:58:33,375 --> 01:58:35,041
Okay?

1548
01:58:35,041 --> 01:58:35,083
Okay?
Got it?

1549
01:58:35,083 --> 01:58:36,583
Got it?

1550
01:58:41,583 --> 01:58:43,166
Actually...

1551
01:58:48,250 --> 01:58:52,041
Actually there is one thing I
want you to know before you take

1552
01:58:52,041 --> 01:58:54,416
this test:

1553
01:59:03,250 --> 01:59:08,041
You have all taught me so...
very much.

1554
01:59:08,208 --> 01:59:16,208
And I am so very proud of each
and every single one of you.

1555
01:59:22,083 --> 01:59:25,416
All right! Now let's go kick
some ass!

1556
01:59:37,083 --> 01:59:41,250
You will have three hours to
complete the test.

1557
01:59:43,416 --> 01:59:48,583
You should try to answer as many
questions as you can.

1558
01:59:50,333 --> 01:59:57,125
Any answers left blank will
count against you

1559
02:00:00,541 --> 02:00:02,125
Good luck!

1560
02:00:19,125 --> 02:00:20,708
And...

1561
02:00:20,916 --> 02:00:23,041
...let's begin.

1562
02:00:24,375 --> 02:00:26,791
The year before Sergio's
arrival, only 55% of his

1563
02:00:26,791 --> 02:00:30,208
students passed the ENLACE in
Math and 69% in Language.

1564
02:00:30,208 --> 02:00:33,208
None received a score of
"Excellent."

1565
02:00:33,208 --> 02:00:35,000
In 2012, after a year with
Sergio,

1566
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:36,375
93% passed the Mathematics
portion, with 63% scoring

1567
02:00:36,375 --> 02:00:38,000
"Excellent",

1568
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:39,333
and 97.5% passed the Language
portion, with 72% scoring

1569
02:00:39,333 --> 02:00:41,166
"Excellent".

1570
02:00:41,166 --> 02:00:44,375
Ten of Sergio's students scored
in the top 0.1% nationally in

1571
02:00:44,375 --> 02:00:46,875
Mathematics.

1572
02:00:47,833 --> 02:00:50,625
Paloma Noyola achieved the
highest score...

1573
02:00:50,625 --> 02:00:53,083
...in all of Mexico.

1574
02:00:53,083 --> 02:00:55,875
She became a national sensation
and received a private grant

1575
02:00:55,875 --> 02:00:59,041
that allowed her to move to a
new home.

1576
02:00:59,291 --> 02:01:02,666
Sergio Juárez Correa still lives
in Matamoros

1577
02:01:02,666 --> 02:01:06,208
where he continues to teach
sixth grade.

1578
02:01:06,208 --> 02:01:09,125
José Urbina López Elementary
School still has no computer

1579
02:01:09,125 --> 02:01:11,416
lab.

1580
02:01:48,458 --> 02:01:54,208
Like a flame flickering in the
wind

1581
02:01:56,083 --> 02:02:01,583
It's the sand that rises

1582
02:02:03,458 --> 02:02:08,541
The sorrow that time heals

1583
02:02:08,541 --> 02:02:15,625
And knowing, knowing, knowing,
knowing

1584
02:02:15,625 --> 02:02:23,208
The sun will rise, come morning
light

1585
02:02:28,750 --> 02:02:34,041
Like the angel of destiny

1586
02:02:36,208 --> 02:02:41,125
Casts stones along the way

1587
02:02:43,125 --> 02:02:48,375
It's my voice, my light, my
heartbeat

1588
02:02:48,375 --> 02:02:56,083
And knowing, knowing, knowing,
knowing

1589
02:02:56,083 --> 02:03:03,208
The sun will rise, come morning
light

1590
02:03:05,583 --> 02:03:11,208
The laughter that sweetens life

1591
02:03:11,791 --> 02:03:17,291
The fight I embrace each new day

1592
02:03:19,083 --> 02:03:24,791
All those pearls are hidden

1593
02:03:24,791 --> 02:03:32,458
In the darkness they'll remain.

1594
02:03:39,208 --> 02:03:43,083
Let's push against the current

1595
02:03:43,083 --> 02:03:46,500
Through seas and rivers, a tidal
surge

1596
02:03:46,500 --> 02:03:50,375
A strong burst of faith is
what's needed

1597
02:03:50,375 --> 02:03:54,041
Where will it lead?

1598
02:04:04,625 --> 02:04:08,583
Where will they go?

1599
02:04:14,541 --> 02:04:19,166
The light looks at us serene

1600
02:04:21,875 --> 02:04:26,083
Restless upon waking

1601
02:04:29,083 --> 02:04:34,125
A song that lives and resonates

1602
02:04:34,125 --> 02:04:41,166
And knowing, knowing, knowing,
knowing

1603
02:04:41,166 --> 02:04:48,750
The sun will rise, come morning
light

1604
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:56,083
It's knowing, knowing, knowing,
knowing

1605
02:04:56,083 --> 02:05:03,625
The sun will rise, come morning
light

1606
02:05:03,708 --> 02:05:10,833
Knowing, knowing, knowing,
knowing

1607
02:05:10,833 --> 02:05:23,041
The sun will rise, come morning
light

1608
02:05:26,166 --> 02:05:27,916
“The only thing that interferes
with my learning is my

1609
02:05:27,916 --> 02:05:30,041
education”

1610
02:05:30,041 --> 02:05:33,083
Albert Einstein

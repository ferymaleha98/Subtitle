3
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,720
{\an8}<i>What is the meaning of happiness?</i>

4
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,480
{\an8}<i>What is the meaning of life?</i>

5
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,760
{\an8}<i>What is the point of a love lost?</i>

6
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:08,200
<i>What is fate if you can't change destiny?</i>

7
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,320
<i>The darkness that lingers on.</i>
<i>A bloodline lost.</i>

8
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,760
<i>Now I'm left all alone,</i>
<i>a witness in the darkness.</i>

9
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,640
<i>The evil that embraces… Will it ever end?</i>

10
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,040
TWO DAYS AGO…

11
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,000
Tonight…

12
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,160
it's a fight to the death for you.

13
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,040
You don't have a choice.

14
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,960
You have to prove you are the best
and that there's no one better.

15
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,400
Know this, you will not be
remembered if you lose.

16
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,000
Greetings! It's time.

17
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,720
<i>- Armand! Armand!</i>
- Come on!

18
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,960
What are you waiting for?

19
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,320
<i>- Armand! Armand!</i>
- See? He can't even hear you.

20
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
Who cares?

21
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,840
What do you care? Why don't you go
sit over there and leave us alone?

22
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,200
They're fighters, I'm a lover.
I have to look after the two of you.

23
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,880
You're being a bit too much right now.

24
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,400
Well… don't be too proud.

25
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,640
All right, go home and get some rest.

26
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,640
Go take care of that girl over there.

27
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,360
All right, then.

28
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,440
So, you're the one who knocked out
the other guy, huh?

29
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,440
But this doesn't mean anything.

30
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,440
Why didn't you end the fight quickly?

31
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,360
That's just not my style.

32
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,320
I prefer a good brawl.
I want my battle scars.

33
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm not into clinching.

34
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,040
Now, it would be different if I…

35
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,360
If you were to hug me, huh?

36
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,240
Well, the view from here isn't so bad.

37
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,840
Maybe you can say, "I love you too."

38
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,160
But I think how I feel
is more important than what I say.

39
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,240
I still love you, you know.

40
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,040
You have to be so sickly sweet, don't you?

41
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,120
I swear I'm about to throw up.

42
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,960
You don't like it when guys act all sweet?

43
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,480
Let's just go home. It stinks here.

44
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,920
It stinks! Let's go. It stinks.

45
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,680
What was that all about? Sore loser.

46
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,240
- Did he need something?
- Come on, let's get going.

47
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,280
What does he want?

48
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,480
He's lucky they sent you instead of me.

49
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,960
- What else do you want, Nyi?
- Did you forget?

50
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,080
Are you senile?

51
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,800
Old man.

52
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,800
- The time has come for me to take Roxana.
- You have no right to come here…

53
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,760
and touch what's mine.

54
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,800
The moment you retired…

55
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,080
the covenant between our worlds
was broken.

56
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,840
I must destroy you and your progeny.

57
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,520
Oh God!

58
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,000
- Why do you keep sighing?
- I'm bored.

59
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,560
I've asked you repeatedly,
where are we going?

60
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,480
You keep saying,
"I'll tell you in a minute."

61
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,200
I'll tell you in a minute.

62
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,799
But you ought to stop sighing.

63
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,880
It's not doing your plump figure
any favors.

64
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,400
Damn you!

65
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,760
Just follow my lead, Mir.
I know how we can get some gold.

66
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,120
How?

67
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,720
Well, first,
we have to find us a dead body.

68
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,640
- A corpse?
- A corpse.

69
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,440
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I am.

70
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,440
Have you lost your mind?

71
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,120
You know what,
I've always done what you asked.

72
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,720
It's time for you to return the favor.

73
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,360
Do you want anything?

74
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,280
- No, thanks.
- How about you?

75
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,640
Let's go.

76
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,880
We rarely get the chance to go out
just the two of us.

77
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,880
What brought that up?

78
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,480
Those two rascals
are always tagging along.

79
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,480
You know what,
those two rascals are like our bodyguards.

80
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,120
Okay.

81
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,760
How about we go on a dinner date?

82
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,400
Dinner in KL.

83
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,760
Dinner? In KL?

84
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,000
Why? Is there a ring in the picture?

85
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,480
Why so special all of a sudden?

86
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,560
And a ring? That's such a western thing.
We don't have to do as they do.

87
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,200
You're right.

88
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,640
Today isn't special?

89
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,400
Not just screaming,
how does it go, "Adrian!"

90
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,760
- Hey!
- What?

91
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,120
Don't make fun of that scene, okay?

92
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,480
Hold on, I have to go to the bathroom.

93
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,080
Is that all?

94
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,560
- I need a bag, please.
- No problem.

95
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,880
Is that really your name?

96
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,200
What do you think?

97
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,280
I think your name is Russell.

98
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,440
What do you think?

99
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,200
I think you think my name is Russel.

100
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,320
That's too deep for me.

101
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:45,720
<i>I've got that loving feeling, hey!</i>
<i>I've got that loving feeling, hey!</i>

102
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,640
<i>See that girl in the distance,</i>
<i>I've got that loving feeling, hey!</i>

103
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:11,520
<i>I've got that loving feeling, hey!</i>
<i>I've got that loving feeling, hey!</i>

104
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,520
<i>See that girl in the distance,</i>
<i>I've got that loving feeling, hey!</i>

105
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,400
I wonder if this is enough.

106
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,160
Yes, I'd like to make a reservation.

107
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,840
- Yus!
- Yes?

108
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,920
- What's that ugly thing?
- What? Where?

109
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,280
Hurry, Zayton!

110
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,680
Where are you going?
He always has to play the hero.

111
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,600
Why not take the car? Come on, let's go!

112
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,240
Is this really where we're supposed to go?

113
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,840
According to this app,
this is where Armand is.

114
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,360
Who in their right minds
would come to such a place?

115
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,840
Never mind. Let's just go in.

116
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,400
You just wait there, okay?

117
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,840
I'll feed you later.

118
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,160
Don't be scared!

119
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,960
I just want to play with you.

120
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,160
Wow! You have such beautiful eyes!

121
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,440
Where's my toy?

122
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,680
Did you take my toy?

123
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,200
You stole it, didn't you? You're a thief.

124
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,320
Where is it? Where is my toy?

125
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,720
Be careful, Zayton, be careful.

126
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,040
It's so dark.

127
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,240
- Be quiet!
- It's too dark.

128
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,480
Listen!

129
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,640
Rose is somewhere over there.

130
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,040
I'm going to sneak in.
The two of you stay here.

131
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,600
Armand! Idiot!

132
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,000
Where's my toy?

133
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,680
Where's my toy?

134
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,400
Where's my toy?

135
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,080
Where's my toy? Where is it?

136
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,920
Who's that?

137
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,560
Why don't you come on in?

138
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,760
I forgot to put the phone on silent!

139
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,280
- Don't be mad!
- Yus! Zayton! Hurry up and untie me!

140
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,880
Get inside, Zayton. Hurry!

141
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,320
What is this place?
What is that godawful smell?

142
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
- Oh, my God! There's a dead body!
- Hurry! Hurry!

143
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,440
What kind of road is this?

144
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,840
- Turn left! Left!
- Now you tell me!

145
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,760
I said left!

146
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,440
- Do you know how to drive?
- Hey!

147
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,280
- Are you even paying attention?
- That burns!

148
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,960
Where are we?
I don't think I've been here before.

149
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,120
If you're that horny,
go find yourself a hooker!

150
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,520
Hookers?

151
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,360
Where's the thrill in that?

152
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,520
I thought we were getting closer.

153
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,000
- Nothing! Still nothing!
- Shut up! Shut up!

154
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,720
- Where do I go? Turn right!
- Turn right!

155
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,760
Armand! That's Armand right there.

156
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,960
Oh, my… He beat that guy to a pulp.

157
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,680
Rose, get in the car!

158
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,440
Get in the car!

159
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,240
Where are we going?

160
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,000
Let's go!

161
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,600
Scoot over.
I can't see out the rear window!

162
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,760
Hurry, Yus.

163
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,640
What the…

164
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,560
What are we going to do?

165
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,760
We have to call the police.

166
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,640
- Let's go.
- Rose. Rose.

167
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,360
I just beat him up.

168
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:52,000
Rose, Rose, Rose. Hear me out.
We need to lay low. Forget the police.

169
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,080
All right. Okay.

170
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,520
We'll go to my house, okay?

171
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,080
We'll go to my house

172
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,520
- Okay. You killed someone.
- I just killed someone.

173
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,000
I killed him!

174
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,680
- Zayton, get in.
- Let's go.

175
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,400
Yus, get in. I'll drive.

176
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,800
Get in. Zayton?

177
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,600
It was an accident.
I didn't mean to hit him.

178
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,440
A YEAR AGO

179
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,400
You can't protect Roxana forever,
Haji Ramli.

180
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,680
Don't you dare say my name!

181
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:26,880
I am Tuan Haji Ramli, son of Haji Putih,
General of Sulur Prahanga.

182
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,200
Humans are weak.

183
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:36,520
If not for that machete in your hand,
you would've died a gruesome death.

184
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,480
It's okay.

185
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:43,080
Tonight, there will be bloodshed.

186
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,720
Fate will determine…

187
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,520
who will come out on top.

188
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,000
Don't you dare come back here again!

189
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,440
Where on earth
are we going to find a corpse?

190
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,160
We've looked everywhere!

191
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,200
My pants are wet
and I need a shower. It's a mess!

192
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,960
Patience, Mir. Are you hungry?

193
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,000
- Of course.
- Come on, I'll buy you breakfast.

194
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,000
- All right, let's go.
- Where to?

195
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,320
You're buying, so it's your call.
Anywhere will do.

196
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,160
Somewhere with plenty of eye candy.

197
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,160
Nice.

198
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,760
Oh, no, my pants!

199
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,520
- Oh god!
- You-- Well, hurry up!

200
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,040
You're such a lousy driver.

201
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,160
Waiter!

202
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,640
Coffee, black. And French toast, please.

203
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,760
Same for me, with extra eggs. Soft-boiled.

204
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,560
Waiter?

205
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,480
- What's going on?
- That ruckus? They found a dead body.

206
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,120
A corpse? I see…

207
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,920
- A corpse!
- A corpse!

208
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,200
This is our chance!

209
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,320
Let's grab the body
before a crowd appears.

210
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,160
- I'll get the car.
- All right, I'll take care of the rest.

211
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,520
What happened?

212
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:02,800
Who did this to you?
I told you, choose your friends carefully!

213
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:08,760
Jeffrey! I'll take you to the hospital.

214
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,360
What? I'm too late?

215
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,640
- I'm sorry, my friend.
- Coming through!

216
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:24,240
Oh, my God! Kassim! Oh, my God! Kassim!

217
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,240
Kassim! What happened?
Who did this to you?

218
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,480
This isn't Kassim.
This is his identical twin, Jeffrey.

219
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,240
What? Kassim has a twin?

220
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,160
Enough of that, let's put him in the car.

221
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,440
Guys, please.
Can you help us get him in the car?

222
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,440
My friend here can't lift.
Let's do this together, all right?

223
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,960
Grab him right here, will you?
Yes, right here.

224
00:31:54,800 --> 00:32:00,800
Right here. Okay. Ready? One, two, lift!

225
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,880
Very good. Over here. All right.

226
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,480
Here you go, have some.

227
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,560
Eat.

228
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,360
Let's eat.

229
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,600
Are you okay, Rose?

230
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,440
Why did you have to go
and remind me? I'm fine.

231
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,560
- I was just wondering.
- Babe, that's what we're supposed to do.

232
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,360
The dead guy must be mad at us.

233
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,600
- You drove right over him!
- Your grandpa can hear us!

234
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,520
I've lost my appetite.

235
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,040
Zayton, are you okay?

236
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,480
Let me through, please!
Let me through.

237
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:13,840
This punk with his feet
sticking out the window…

238
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,199
Slow down!

239
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,679
Hold your horses!

240
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,679
Relax, bro! What are you so mad about?

241
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,800
You know what
we're supposed to be doing today, right?

242
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:56,159
Oh, man, I totally forgot!
Mind if I take a raincheck?

243
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,920
- Now is not a good time.
- That's unacceptable.

244
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,400
If you want my business,
don't waste my time.

245
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,200
That's enough. Let's get going.

246
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,600
Where's Armand?

247
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,040
Cut it out!

248
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:17,080
- Armand? Armand?
- Roxana! Armand wants to go work out!

249
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,960
- Come on, man! Quit yelling.
- Are you mad, bro?

250
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,880
Come on, let's go.

251
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,880
For a measly pot of gold,
you're willing to go pretty far.

252
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,000
Why are you still complaining?

253
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,040
When it's your plan,
I always just go along with it.

254
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,480
When it's my plan,
something's always the matter.

255
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,760
Well, you know what?

256
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,120
For my entire life, I have never
had to go looking for a dead body!

257
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,760
Is that the witch doctor?

258
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,560
No wonder you're so eager.

259
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,000
That's not a witch doctor,
that's a model.

260
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,360
Cut it out, man.

261
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:06,000
She's been waiting for a while.
You want her to put a curse on you?

262
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:11,920
You're getting a little thin on top.
You should ask her for a potion for that.

263
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,560
Hey, Nap!

264
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,000
Don't make fun of my hair.
It's a sensitive subject.

265
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,360
At least I can reach the top shelf,
unlike you.

266
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,760
You want to flirt with the witch doctor,
don't you?

267
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,320
Says who? And so what?
You think you stand a chance?

268
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,400
Just you wait.

269
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,640
That's enough of that, it's about to rain.

270
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:45,320
<i>You turn me on</i>

271
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,760
Hey, Nap.

272
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,760
What are we going to do?

273
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,280
This guy is way too heavy.

274
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,920
Why are we doing this right now
in this godforsaken heat?

275
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,560
Why can't we do it at night,
when it's nice and cool?

276
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,960
- But no, we have to do this now!
- Come on, bro. Stop complaining.

277
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,840
Guys, look! A Beretta!

278
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,960
- What on earth? What's wrong with you?
- Here, take it.

279
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,000
- Are you trying to start a war?
- Why did you hand it to me?

280
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,560
- Why did you drop it?
- You want me to hold it?

281
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,960
Calm down! It's just a gun.

282
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,560
Better to have it and not need it.
Those guys are crazy.

283
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,280
Like…

284
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,600
I am going to explode! You see this?
It's about to explode in your face!

285
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,880
A gangster wannabe
who can't do it on his own.

286
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,560
He had to drag us along.
He had to bring Armand.

287
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,800
Why did you kill him?

288
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,440
Are you crazy?

289
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,000
Oh, my God!

290
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,640
- Why would you do something like that?
- It's not funny!

291
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,280
- It's not funny!
- You guys are boring.

292
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,360
You guys are boring.

293
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,640
What do you plan to do with this body?

294
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,240
Where's the gold you promised?

295
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,480
What? This isn't gold.

296
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,760
What the hell!

297
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,560
I'm sorry.

298
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,480
This is for filling up my tummy,
not my coffers.

299
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:20,920
Take this to Pak Walok.
Tell him it's from me.

300
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,120
You'll get what you want.

301
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,800
I see. All right, then.
I think it's time for us to go.

302
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:34,760
Hey, Nap. What's the hurry?
Are you trying to get between us?

303
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,640
Why don't you just stay for a bit?

304
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,600
Don't you want to wait for him to awaken?

305
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,240
I'll make you some food.

306
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,560
Deal?

307
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,480
Hello? Armand?

308
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,720
Where are you?

309
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,160
Hold on, babe.

310
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,040
Hurry! What's that over there?

311
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,480
Hey, how do I look?

312
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:53,200
I think my hair is all messed up.
Must be from last night.

313
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,800
You should come with me
when I go get it repaired.

314
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,200
Pak Walok.

315
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,400
I've done what you asked.
Now fulfill your promise.

316
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,640
Good.

317
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,720
Hey?

318
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,600
Stop messing around.

319
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,400
Hey!

320
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,400
Oh, shit!

321
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,200
Just kidding.

322
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,280
Little brother!

323
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,680
Great, we have a wannabe comedian here.

324
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,520
Give it to him.

325
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:42,840
Hey!

326
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:48,400
- You think this is Compton?
- Come on, Sosa, let's just go.

327
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,240
No, there's something's wrong
with that guy.

328
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:53,400
Hey, we've finished the deal.
No need to act all macho. Let's just go!

329
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:04,720
- Great! Just great! Sosa, come here!
- Who's that lady over there?

330
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,360
How long have you been sitting there?

331
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:16,000
I've been waiting for a while.
You just now combed your hair, right?

332
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,960
Now, why don't you do mine?

333
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:22,880
Me?

334
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,600
Why are you being so affectionate
right now? You're embarrassing me.

335
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,040
You were trying to scare me, weren't you?

336
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,840
Okay, and now?
You want your hair up or down?

337
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,840
Either is fine.

338
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,320
Run!

339
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:23,680
<i>Four maidens sit by the river</i>

340
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:30,160
<i>Trying to trap the crab on the rock</i>

341
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,000
Keep singing!

342
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,320
I think I got him!

343
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:47,880
But wait, isn't that the guy
I drove over last night?

344
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,720
- He's still alive?
- Let's get out of here!

345
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,080
What are you saying?

346
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,520
Grandpa!

347
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,440
You impudent demon!

348
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:51,520
Grandpa!

349
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,960
I couldn't find you earlier.
Where were you?

350
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,880
I was upstairs.

351
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,880
Roxana,
find Ustaz Asri in here and call him.

352
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,160
Call the number below as well.

353
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,120
Don't forget the rope.

354
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,240
You've crossed the line, Nyi.

355
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,040
So young.

356
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:36,480
Nowadays, even the young can be an <i>ustaz.</i>

357
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,640
Oh, no, this is bad.

358
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:43,600
How do you know?

359
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,720
No one who's been possessed,
has ever called me "sexy."

360
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:57,400
There is no god worthy of worship
except Him, Ever-Living, All-Sustaining.

361
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,960
Neither drowsiness
nor sleep overtakes Him.

362
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:03,160
To Him belongs whatever is in
the heavens and whatever is on the earth.

363
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:06,440
Who could possibly intercede
without His permission?

364
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:09,040
He fully knows what is ahead
and what is behind,

365
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:13,000
but no one can grasp His knowledge,
except what He wills them to know.

366
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:16,240
His seat encompasses
the heavens and the earth.

367
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:21,400
The preservation of neither tires Him.
For He is Most High, the Greatest.

368
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,840
Roxana, where's the water bottle?

369
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:11,080
<i>- Zayton has been possessed.</i>
- She's been possessed?

370
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,760
Mand, floor it! Mand, floor it!

371
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:27,520
In the name of Allah.

372
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:31,440
Oh, Devil! I remind you of your oath!

373
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,120
Oh, Devil! I remind you of--

374
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,120
[chanting]

375
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:16,080
Blood debts are paid in blood!

376
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,320
Descendant of murderers!

377
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:44,000
What else could go wrong today?

378
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:49,640
Faster, Mand.

379
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,520
Mand, what is that? What is it?

380
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,360
- It's that lady again!
- Watch out!

381
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,200
Now you're just asking for it!

382
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,640
So you're going to play rough, huh?

383
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,200
I need to change my strategy.

384
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,920
Peace be upon you. What is your name?

385
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:48,080
God, I saw my life flash before my eyes.

386
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,480
Thank God this car is built like a tank.

387
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,160
Did you see what I saw?

388
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,000
I think I broke my bones.

389
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,200
It's that old lady
I was telling you about earlier.

390
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,200
What are we going to do?

391
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,000
- Come on, let's go.
- What about the car?

392
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:35,880
Great, now we have to walk.

393
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,280
What?

394
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,600
Now it's going to explode?

395
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:51,560
It's an old Saga, bro.

396
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,720
Makes you feel like an action hero,
doesn't it?

397
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:00,920
Just like Will Smith.

398
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:20,640
What happened?

399
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:23,600
I'll tell you later, okay?

400
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,440
- Ustaz?
- Yes?

401
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,320
- Is she okay?
- Who is she to you?

402
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,800
We're just friends, Ustaz.

403
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:41,200
- I see. So, that means she's single?
- Oh, my God.

404
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:44,680
- I'm just trying to help her.
- No way.

405
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:47,720
- I helped her.
- But you're a religious teacher.

406
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:52,360
- We have needs too.
- What about me? I don't have needs?

407
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,040
I think…

408
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,240
- I think I know who's behind this.
- Who?

409
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:11,000
- Who is it, Ustaz?
- I'm very sorry.

410
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:12,840
I have to go somewhere.

411
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,200
Make sure you use this properly.

412
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,680
- Peace be upon you.
- Likewise.

413
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:19,960
Likewise.

414
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,440
How can he hit on my girl just like that?

415
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,280
He took his hat and his shotgun,
but he forgot the bullets.

416
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,160
He's such a pain in the ass.

417
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:01,840
A pain?

418
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,920
And he raised me.

419
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:13,520
You don't care about your family.

420
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,040
- You don't appreciate your family.
- Guys, calm down.

421
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,440
We're all stressed out.

422
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,760
We'll find a solution.
Just one step at a time, okay?

423
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,400
Stay here and keep an eye on Zayton,
I'll go after Roxana.

424
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,120
Be careful.
I have a bad feeling about this.

425
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:45,760
I'll see you later.

426
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:14,520
I didn't know
Pak Walok had such a beautiful house.

427
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:16,080
He must be filthy rich.

428
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:28,720
What do you want?

429
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,400
We need to see Pak Walok.

430
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,600
I'm also here to see Pak Walok.

431
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:41,720
Wait.

432
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,080
- I'll go first.
- What?

433
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,800
He's going to jump the queue
just like that?

434
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,960
- I ought to teach him a lesson.
- He's lucky he's an Ustaz.

435
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:00,520
Look, Mir, there's a live band.
Let's check it out.

436
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,920
What would you like to order, Ustaz?

437
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,480
Give me…

438
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,320
a cup of tea, please.

439
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:56,560
We don't serve tea here,
we only have coffee.

440
01:02:58,720 --> 01:02:59,960
Give him a cup of coffee.

441
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:15,480
Be my guest, Ustaz.

442
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:36,120
Do you have something to do with
what's going on tonight?

443
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:39,880
Stop it.

444
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,280
Otherwise, there'll be trouble.

445
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:50,320
That's just the way it is.

446
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:54,400
There is always war.

447
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:59,720
Whether between humans
or with the supernatural.

448
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:45,960
Grandpa!

449
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,840
Oh, my God!

450
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:36,600
That looks like a bat!

451
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:41,320
- What's with you?
- Bathroom break.

452
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,560
Hey, Nap!
Don't just leave me here by myself!

453
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:47,240
That's a bit over the top.
He must think he's Ozzy Osbourne.

454
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:54,480
Something smells delicious.

455
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,720
Grandpa. Grandpa.

456
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,240
Grandpa's gone.

457
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:43,360
He's gone.

458
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:49,280
Grandpa!

459
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:56,880
Grandpa!

460
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:06,640
Grandpa's gone.

461
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:19,640
What a stuck-up…

462
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:53,520
Are you tired?

463
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:56,720
Get some rest, okay?

464
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:12,440
- Hey, Nap, you know what I just saw?
- You know what I saw?

465
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:14,200
- What did you see?
- I have no idea.

466
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:01,600
Pak Walok,
this is the yellow, glutinous rice

467
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:03,320
you're supposed to turn into gold.

468
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:30,640
Nap, don't eat that.

469
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:35,360
We don't know what kind of meat that is.
You don't know what I saw earlier.

470
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,200
Eat! Eat!

471
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:53,520
We're done for, Nap!

472
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:58,720
- I don't want to get eaten!
- We're going to get raped, Mir!

473
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:17,000
Are you going to kill me, Roxana?

474
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:33,080
Babe…

475
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:40,640
Listen, babe…

476
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:54,840
Remember what you said to me once?

477
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:27,240
<i>Roxana, you are the woman of my dreams</i>

478
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:31,640
<i>The time will surely come</i>

479
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:39,000
<i>When we will be together in love</i>

480
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:25,800
Bring Roxana to me, Nyi.

481
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:29,160
Without a scratch on her.

482
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:35,880
Don't disobey him.

483
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,880
Pak Walok wants Roxana…

484
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:41,240
unharmed and intact.

485
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:35,160
Your friend is gone, Roxana!

486
01:20:57,160 --> 01:21:00,560
Do you want to kill me, Roxana?

487
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,360
No!

488
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:19,120
What's the matter?

489
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:22,240
You don't approve?

490
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:36,440
An eye for an eye, blood for blood.
This is your parents' fault.

491
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:38,440
For killing us…

492
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:41,480
the practitioners of the dark arts.

493
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:52,240
Trying to be heroes,
trying to save the world.

494
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:54,240
You know what?

495
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:59,000
The dark arts are the future.

496
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:02,720
It doesn't matter how many of us you kill.

497
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:05,920
There will always be more of us.

498
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:09,640
And we will conquer the world.

499
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:39,720
Tantari.

500
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:46,360
What do you want?

501
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:54,480
I've killed General Atuk.

502
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:57,720
Don't try to stop me, murderer!

503
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:01,560
Where's the thing that you stole?

504
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:04,680
You're not fit to hold it.

505
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,240
Tantari.

506
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:11,200
It will be mine once I've killed you.

507
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:15,680
Let's settle this once and for all
and see who reigns supreme!

508
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:31,360
Kill Roxana.

509
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:49,720
Hey! Wake up! Wake up!

510
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:58,400
I don't want to be in a stew!

511
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:09,520
It's all your fault
that we've turned into goats!

512
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:14,200
I'm sorry, Mir,
I didn't know it would turn out this way!

513
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:06,240
SIX MONTHS LATER

514
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:26,280
Do you know why I'm here, Pak Walok?

515
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:39,720
I want you to answer my question.

516
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:44,480
And then, you have my permission…

517
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:46,280
to die.

518
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:49,120
Die?

519
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:54,960
Shut up!

520
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:04,680
You should have accepted
my wedding proposal.

521
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:08,800
Now, look! Look what happened!

522
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:15,360
General Atuk and Zayton are both dead.
Armand…

523
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:18,560
dead.

524
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:22,640
I can't believe
you went so far as to ruin my life.

525
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:26,960
Not even God will forgive you, Walok.

526
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:32,360
I told you.
You shouldn't have turned me down!

527
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:36,280
The Almighty has decreed it.

528
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:41,120
Djinn… and humans can't be together.

529
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:44,040
An offer from a cursed Djinn…

530
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:38,240
You turned us into goats!
I've been eating grass for months!

531
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:02,640
<i>In the darkness,</i>
<i>we hope for a ray of truth.</i>

532
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:07,560
<i>In the dark abyss,</i>
<i>we ask for the gift of sight.</i>

533
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:11,760
<i>We sinners, we are naught but dust.</i>

534
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:16,680
<i>Without a soul, the body can't survive.</i>

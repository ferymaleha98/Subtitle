<i>They say that life
never ceases to be a mystery.</i>

00:27.708 --> 00:32.666
Please welcome the finalists
of Wajah Ayu Indonesia 2010!

00:35.375 --> 00:38.458
<i>Nor does it always provide answers.</i>

00:43.166 --> 00:45.833
<i>And time keeps passing.</i>

00:47.250 --> 00:48.458
<i>A moment.</i>

00:50.000 --> 00:51.458
<i>An hour.</i>

00:53.208 --> 00:54.625
<i>A day.</i>

00:56.208 --> 00:57.708
<i>A week.</i>

00:59.166 --> 01:00.458
<i>A month.</i>

01:02.083 --> 01:03.625
<i>And so on.</i>

01:08.291 --> 01:10.874
<i>That said, I found
my true calling as an actress</i>

01:10.875 --> 01:12.750
<i>during my teenage years.</i>

01:14.458 --> 01:18.208
<i>Moving from one role to another.</i>

01:19.416 --> 01:23.791
<i>Those roles made sense
of all the things about life</i>

01:24.333 --> 01:26.250
<i>that I didn't understand.</i>

01:57.833 --> 02:00.040
Let's give a round of applause
for our first finalist,

02:00.041 --> 02:02.500
Ava Alessandra.

02:10.833 --> 02:16.457
To further introduce each finalist
of Wajah Ayu Indonesia 2010,

02:16.458 --> 02:20.540
we will start by asking
finalist number eight a question.

02:20.541 --> 02:21.833
Who is your role model?

02:22.416 --> 02:23.708
My mother.

02:25.458 --> 02:28.000
A strong and inspiring woman

02:29.000 --> 02:30.708
who loves her family.

02:31.291 --> 02:32.208
Maya!

02:33.041 --> 02:36.207
Your daughter will win!

02:36.208 --> 02:40.375
She never complains
and has no regrets in life.

02:42.375 --> 02:44.582
- What kind of wife are you?
- Everyone

02:44.583 --> 02:47.290
- is also tired!
- I'm so tired of you!

02:47.291 --> 02:48.207
Do you know...

02:48.208 --> 02:49.874
I'm so done with you! I'm done!

02:49.875 --> 02:51.665
My heart is broken!

02:51.666 --> 02:52.832
Go away!

02:52.833 --> 02:53.749
Just so you know...

02:53.750 --> 02:54.874
- Go away!
- I'm tired!

02:54.875 --> 02:55.999
I'm so done!

02:56.000 --> 02:57.708
Go away!

03:00.791 --> 03:06.000
After my father left her,

03:08.791 --> 03:10.666
my mother had to work really hard.

03:13.541 --> 03:14.958
Day and night.

03:18.375 --> 03:20.916
As a housekeeping staff at a hotel,

03:23.625 --> 03:26.458
she worked tirelessly to raise me,

03:26.958 --> 03:28.416
educate me,

03:29.291 --> 03:34.208
and make sure that I could achieve
whatever dreams I wanted.

03:37.541 --> 03:42.833
Ava's previous movies have always been
featured in international festivals.

03:43.750 --> 03:46.499
And it's quite an honor for me

03:46.500 --> 03:50.040
to pair up a seasoned actor
like Reza Malik

03:50.041 --> 03:52.790
with the rising star Ava Alessandra

03:52.791 --> 03:55.791
as Ken Arok and Ken Dedes.

04:00.708 --> 04:02.332
Miss Ava!

04:02.333 --> 04:04.041
Please smile, miss!

04:05.000 --> 04:06.040
Look this way, miss!

04:06.041 --> 04:06.957
Okay, miss!

04:06.958 --> 04:08.333
One more time!

04:09.958 --> 04:11.416
Okay. One, two...

04:12.208 --> 04:16.082
Congratulations to the winner
of Wajah Ayu Indonesia 2010!

04:16.083 --> 04:18.999
SECOND RUNNER UP

04:19.000 --> 04:23.458
I hope she can always
inspire women in Indonesia.

04:24.125 --> 04:27.458
And thus...

04:41.375 --> 04:42.291
Who's there?

04:46.125 --> 04:47.125
Maya!

04:48.708 --> 04:50.083
What are you doing?

04:51.000 --> 04:52.458
You've been spacing out.

04:54.833 --> 04:57.083
Finish your work, quick.

04:58.666 --> 05:00.291
Don't forget to turn off the rest.

05:17.791 --> 05:21.791
ADAPTED FROM A NOVEL BY IKA NATASSA

05:32.625 --> 05:33.458
CONDOM

05:37.083 --> 05:38.250
I'll take this one, too.

05:42.166 --> 05:44.458
- How much?
- It's 50,000.

05:52.583 --> 05:53.583
Here's the change.

INDONESIAN IDENTITY CARD

07:41.416 --> 07:42.666
You're a coward!

07:45.291 --> 07:49.125
You wasted my time
listening to your grand speeches.

07:50.125 --> 07:51.875
About your dreams,

07:52.416 --> 07:53.750
your ambitions,

07:54.541 --> 07:56.083
your aspirations.

07:56.958 --> 07:58.708
All your grievances.

08:00.958 --> 08:04.750
Even your hatred towards my husband,
Tunggul Ametung.

08:05.333 --> 08:08.750
A hatred that infected me
like a deadly venom.

08:10.708 --> 08:14.958
And now that I ask you to take action,

08:16.375 --> 08:17.458
you have doubts,

08:18.541 --> 08:19.791
you're afraid!

08:30.041 --> 08:31.583
Cut! Malik?

08:37.708 --> 08:38.540
Is it my line?

08:38.541 --> 08:40.124
I'm really sorry.

08:40.125 --> 08:41.332
This part.

08:41.333 --> 08:42.625
One more line left.

09:14.875 --> 09:16.374
Any more feedback?

09:16.375 --> 09:17.291
Huh?

09:18.666 --> 09:20.375
What was wrong with my acting earlier?

09:22.916 --> 09:23.833
It's difficult.

09:25.041 --> 09:26.166
Me? Difficult?

09:34.333 --> 09:35.708
It's difficult for me.

09:36.625 --> 09:38.457
Difficult to talk to me? What do you mean?

09:38.458 --> 09:40.750
It's difficult to keep up with you.

09:52.916 --> 09:54.957
You were really great.

09:54.958 --> 09:55.916
For real.

10:15.291 --> 10:20.541
Let's proceed to scene 74.
Interior, Tunggul Ametung's room, day.

10:22.125 --> 10:25.207
Tunggul Ametung looks at Ken Dedes,
who is silent and angry

10:25.208 --> 10:28.208
after being humiliated by him
at the party.

10:34.458 --> 10:35.625
And action.

10:36.416 --> 10:40.833
I've turned you from
a mere commoner to a goddess!

10:41.375 --> 10:43.290
I elevated you

10:43.291 --> 10:47.708
from a Pandhita's child to a princess!

10:48.583 --> 10:50.291
I gave you everything!

10:51.291 --> 10:53.874
Gold, jewels,

10:53.875 --> 10:56.125
even a crown!

10:56.708 --> 10:58.541
I never asked for any of it.

10:59.500 --> 11:02.582
Ken Dedes gets up from the bed,
then walks towards the window.

11:02.583 --> 11:03.666
Over there.

11:08.125 --> 11:10.083
Let me remind you
where you came from, Dedes.

11:12.375 --> 11:15.875
The father you grew up remembering
is a fake Pandhita.

11:17.083 --> 11:20.833
I killed him not because I wanted you,

11:22.375 --> 11:25.415
but because he had molested
all the women in your village.

11:25.416 --> 11:27.541
- My father didn't do it!
- That's exactly what he did!

11:29.041 --> 11:31.500
You've been blinded all this time.

11:32.666 --> 11:34.625
You remember false memories.

11:36.583 --> 11:38.125
When I was about to end his life,

11:39.208 --> 11:40.291
he begged for mercy

11:42.291 --> 11:45.833
and offered you as his payout.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.790
But he loved me.

11:49.791 --> 11:51.291
What could you possibly know about love?

11:53.666 --> 11:56.583
You were born from the womb of a harlot.

11:59.875 --> 12:01.208
Your seed grew

12:02.458 --> 12:04.083
because of fortune!

12:05.625 --> 12:06.833
And you...

12:07.541 --> 12:09.500
were the child that no one wished for.

12:25.166 --> 12:27.250
Ava, look at me.

12:27.833 --> 12:31.707
Take a deep breath, slowly.

12:31.708 --> 12:33.957
Exhale.

12:33.958 --> 12:37.541
One... two...

12:38.750 --> 12:39.624
Two.

12:39.625 --> 12:41.000
Three...

12:45.500 --> 12:47.290
Would you like a break?

12:47.291 --> 12:48.666
Let me take care of it.

12:51.041 --> 12:53.290
I'm fine. It's okay.

12:53.291 --> 12:55.499
I just need some space.

12:55.500 --> 12:56.583
Okay.

13:18.750 --> 13:20.000
It happened to me, too.

13:21.083 --> 13:25.374
Especially when it comes
to scenes about mothers,

13:25.375 --> 13:26.875
it's quite rough.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.166
When it spoke about losses,

13:31.166 --> 13:36.290
my mind rushed back to times
where I had to take my mother

13:36.291 --> 13:38.208
for chemo every fortnight.

13:43.750 --> 13:46.791
Well, it wasn't so bad
that I had a panic attack,

13:49.166 --> 13:50.707
but still, it wasn't easy.

13:50.708 --> 13:51.791
I had to...

13:53.333 --> 13:55.665
catch my breath,

13:55.666 --> 13:59.416
distance myself from the situation,
and be alone for a while.

14:01.041 --> 14:03.416
Then, I get back. It's hard, I know.

14:08.166 --> 14:09.916
So, what's haunting you?

14:13.458 --> 14:16.208
I'm here if you need someone to talk to.

14:23.750 --> 14:28.583
Your father left us,
but we keep on living.

14:31.541 --> 14:33.291
As long as you understand.

14:33.791 --> 14:35.916
Disappointment is part of life, Ava.

14:53.583 --> 14:55.500
We did the discussion together!

14:59.291 --> 15:01.458
Then it's your fault
for not being thorough.

15:04.583 --> 15:05.708
Yes!

15:09.250 --> 15:11.207
Then check it properly!

15:11.208 --> 15:13.000
- Dinner's ready.
- I have to...

15:16.958 --> 15:18.000
Do you get it?

15:27.250 --> 15:28.541
This is a work matter.

15:29.166 --> 15:30.875
There's a problem with my contract.

15:32.625 --> 15:34.875
Sorry, but the food's getting cold.

15:43.208 --> 15:47.166
How many times do I have to tell you
not to interrupt my work?

15:48.666 --> 15:52.582
Do you think my work
is less important than your food?

15:52.583 --> 15:54.583
- I'm sorry.
- Look at me when you speak.

16:02.958 --> 16:03.916
Let's eat.

16:04.708 --> 16:06.125
It's getting cold.

16:23.791 --> 16:25.500
Your food is second to none.

16:32.291 --> 16:33.416
Just like you.

16:37.166 --> 16:38.958
You mean the world to me.

17:00.750 --> 17:01.875
Does it hurt?

17:06.291 --> 17:07.333
I'm sorry.

17:39.875 --> 17:43.499
No tips for trainees.

17:43.500 --> 17:44.416
Come.

18:02.541 --> 18:03.416
The towel.

18:04.958 --> 18:06.333
Can you also please fix up my room?

18:12.541 --> 18:13.833
Why aren't you going in?

18:15.416 --> 18:17.458
I think it's inappropriate. He's...

18:20.875 --> 18:22.250
You've never seen a naked man before?

18:24.041 --> 18:25.333
Don't get any ideas.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.083
No one's going to lust after you either.

18:28.666 --> 18:30.249
You reek of wet mop.

18:30.250 --> 18:31.208
Go.

18:45.500 --> 18:46.457
Miss!

18:46.458 --> 18:49.499
No need to change the bed sheet.

18:49.500 --> 18:51.166
Just fix it up!

18:54.916 --> 18:55.916
Pardon?

18:56.500 --> 18:58.540
No need to change the bed sheet.

18:58.541 --> 19:00.750
Just fix it up!

19:05.583 --> 19:06.583
Yes, sir.

19:25.500 --> 19:27.666
INDONESIAN IDENTITY CARD

19:43.708 --> 19:44.625
Are you done?

19:47.416 --> 19:48.708
Just do the rest later.

19:50.208 --> 19:51.125
Yes, sir.

20:05.041 --> 20:06.000
Miss.

20:06.791 --> 20:07.833
Wait.

20:14.458 --> 20:17.125
<i>There is not a single war challenge
that I run away from.</i>

20:20.791 --> 20:22.625
No enemies that I fear.

20:24.083 --> 20:29.875
No amount of pain enough
to make me avoid or defy death.

20:31.875 --> 20:33.375
Except for you.

20:42.750 --> 20:44.666
You are my battlefield.

20:46.041 --> 20:46.875
My enemy.

20:50.041 --> 20:51.416
My pain.

20:58.583 --> 21:00.583
My challenge of death.

21:13.750 --> 21:17.750
I am very grateful to have been given
this opportunity by Mr. Ranbir.

21:18.250 --> 21:23.499
Through this role of Ken Dedes, I was
introduced to some very talented people.

21:23.500 --> 21:26.332
I got to work with Cornelio Sunny,

21:26.333 --> 21:28.958
a director whose work
I have always admired.

21:29.625 --> 21:31.207
<i>Also, Reza Malik,</i>

21:31.208 --> 21:35.125
<i>a co-star who is always supportive
and open to share his experiences.</i>

21:38.208 --> 21:40.875
I should've done this long ago.

21:42.250 --> 21:44.458
You're nothing without me.

21:45.958 --> 21:49.916
Did you forget the one
who made you who you are today?

21:51.416 --> 21:55.875
Yet, I'm no more than just a shadow
and an accessory in your every ambition.

21:56.875 --> 21:59.749
When I first became an actor
at the age of 12,

21:59.750 --> 22:01.707
my father told me that

22:01.708 --> 22:06.166
a good actor is one who could bring out
the best in their co-stars.

22:06.791 --> 22:10.207
I hope that's what I did with Ava,

22:10.208 --> 22:12.500
supporting her performance in this movie.

22:14.375 --> 22:16.000
<i>You're not the one.</i>

22:17.000 --> 22:18.582
You wear a crown,

22:18.583 --> 22:20.250
but you remain a commoner at heart.

22:21.291 --> 22:22.374
You're a fake.

22:22.375 --> 22:23.457
I think

22:23.458 --> 22:29.500
Ava has extraordinary commitment
and dedication as Ken Dedes.

22:30.250 --> 22:32.665
And in her hand, I'm sure

22:32.666 --> 22:37.125
Ken Dedes will become an icon
of Indonesia's strong female figures.

23:14.291 --> 23:15.250
Cut!

23:16.083 --> 23:18.458
Ava, you nailed it in the beginning!
Why did you stop?

23:19.583 --> 23:21.040
I'm sorry.

23:21.041 --> 23:23.000
Ava! Hey.

23:23.958 --> 23:25.708
Let's wrap it up.

23:30.791 --> 23:32.916
Ava. Hey.

23:35.583 --> 23:36.500
It's okay.

23:38.791 --> 23:41.125
Breathe. Calm down.

23:41.916 --> 23:44.083
Take a deep breath.

23:47.625 --> 23:48.832
It's okay.

23:48.833 --> 23:51.041
Hey, look at me.

23:51.791 --> 23:53.375
Ken Arok deserves to die.

23:54.000 --> 23:54.875
Okay?

23:55.416 --> 23:59.916
- Those incidents flash before my eyes.
- I know. That's okay.

24:01.333 --> 24:02.666
It's okay. Come here.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.332
You're stronger than this, okay?

24:06.333 --> 24:08.374
You just need to act.

24:08.375 --> 24:10.375
That's it. Okay?

24:15.791 --> 24:16.625
Breathe.

24:20.250 --> 24:21.250
It's okay.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.499
Ava, are you dating Malik?

24:23.500 --> 24:24.624
What's your next project?

24:24.625 --> 24:26.249
Ava, how are you still single?

24:26.250 --> 24:27.374
Ava, what about your father?

24:27.375 --> 24:30.040
- Ava!
- Do you resent your father?

24:30.041 --> 24:31.249
Did it affect your career in any way?

24:31.250 --> 24:32.999
Ava, are you really dating Malik?

24:33.000 --> 24:34.624
- Ava!
- Please, one at a time.

24:34.625 --> 24:37.416
- What do you have to say, Ava?
- Sorry.

24:40.833 --> 24:43.582
- Are you two really dating?
- Ava! Malik!

24:43.583 --> 24:46.791
Ava! Ava!

24:47.916 --> 24:49.041
Ava!

24:50.250 --> 24:52.707
Slate 149, take three.

24:52.708 --> 24:53.875
Take!

25:03.666 --> 25:04.625
Cut!

25:12.125 --> 25:14.791
The one who just kissed you

25:15.291 --> 25:18.165
was not Ken Arok, it was Malik.

25:18.166 --> 25:19.541
I just want you to know.

25:21.958 --> 25:23.041
How was it?

25:40.583 --> 25:43.415
<i>My mom didn't get to watch my movies.</i>

25:43.416 --> 25:45.082
<i>She had bone tuberculosis</i>

25:45.083 --> 25:48.541
<i>when I got my first
soap opera contract from Mas Tito.</i>

25:49.541 --> 25:53.000
By the time it aired,
she had already passed away.

25:54.541 --> 25:55.875
What about your father?

25:56.625 --> 25:58.208
Ever looked for him?

25:59.375 --> 26:00.333
I have.

26:01.125 --> 26:02.250
No luck?

26:02.916 --> 26:03.750
Nope.

26:07.083 --> 26:09.375
I'm allowed to hate my own father, right?

26:19.750 --> 26:20.791
Meaning?

26:21.291 --> 26:28.290
Meaning, the more you try
to not see, hear, or feel anything,

26:28.291 --> 26:33.375
the more those feelings
will demand to be seen, heard, and felt.

26:36.083 --> 26:37.457
That's far too complicated.

26:37.458 --> 26:41.207
Look, the bottom line is

26:41.208 --> 26:45.625
that you don't actually hate your father,
you miss him.

26:51.791 --> 26:55.957
In movies, we have the script
to serve as a guide.

26:55.958 --> 26:59.500
It works as a compass for us to follow.

27:00.208 --> 27:03.375
Then, there's the director
that yells "Action!" and "Cut!".

27:04.083 --> 27:05.500
But we don't have that in real life.

27:08.125 --> 27:09.083
But...

27:10.125 --> 27:15.790
every actor has their own method
of getting in and out of their character.

27:15.791 --> 27:18.708
- You have your way as well.
- Yep.

27:19.291 --> 27:23.666
Let's say you're in a horror movie,
what would you do?

27:24.625 --> 27:28.165
I'm not sure.
I've never been offered to play in one.

27:28.166 --> 27:31.499
But if given the opportunity,
I'd love to do it.

27:31.500 --> 27:33.125
I think it would be exciting.

27:35.083 --> 27:39.415
It's a horror movie,
and you're playing the ghost.

27:39.416 --> 27:43.833
How are you going to go back to being Ava?

27:46.541 --> 27:50.000
I would hide in my kind of place.

27:50.666 --> 27:52.458
And where is that place?

27:55.541 --> 27:56.500
Can't tell you.

27:57.541 --> 27:58.583
It's a secret.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.874
<i>Maya, where are you?</i>

28:10.875 --> 28:12.791
<i>Don't forget to eat.</i>

29:15.916 --> 29:17.041
INDONESIAN IDENTITY CARD

29:47.000 --> 29:47.833
Who's there?

30:32.416 --> 30:34.165
- Miss.
- Stay away from me!

30:34.166 --> 30:37.249
Easy there, miss. Hey. I'm trying to help.

30:37.250 --> 30:40.499
I should be the one asking who you are
and why you are in my closet.

30:40.500 --> 30:42.290
You're the one who stalked me.

30:42.291 --> 30:44.416
I'm just taking back my wallet you stole.

30:45.750 --> 30:48.457
So, you're that
chicken onion cup noodle girl?

30:48.458 --> 30:50.541
So, it's true that you stalked me.

30:51.916 --> 30:53.541
Now, let me out

30:54.333 --> 30:56.790
- or I'll scream.
- Please stay calm.

30:56.791 --> 30:58.749
I admit that I followed you that night

30:58.750 --> 31:01.375
- to return your wallet that--
- Liar!

31:01.958 --> 31:05.040
Why didn't you just call out to me?
You think I'm that stupid?

31:05.041 --> 31:07.832
How? I don't even know your name.

31:07.833 --> 31:10.041
I haven't even seen inside your wallet.

31:17.791 --> 31:19.125
I'm not a bad person.

31:27.291 --> 31:28.666
I'm Raga.

31:31.583 --> 31:32.625
I'm Av...

31:34.291 --> 31:35.166
Maya.

31:48.750 --> 31:50.125
You left your wallet.

31:55.541 --> 31:56.875
Thank you, Raga.

31:57.666 --> 31:58.875
Your pen.

32:18.250 --> 32:19.166
Maya!

32:21.083 --> 32:21.916
Maya!

32:49.333 --> 32:50.333
May.

32:52.375 --> 32:54.957
You look like
you've been chased by a ghost.

32:54.958 --> 32:56.958
I've been calling you.

32:58.208 --> 32:59.125
I'm sorry.

33:02.666 --> 33:03.665
Iis is sick.

33:03.666 --> 33:06.082
We have to cover for her now.

33:06.083 --> 33:07.500
Get ready.

33:16.541 --> 33:17.500
This is good.

33:18.541 --> 33:19.541
You want some?

33:28.000 --> 33:30.208
Aren't you feeling lonely?

33:32.208 --> 33:35.000
No boyfriend. You hardly ever go out.

33:35.625 --> 33:37.875
On your days off,
you stay cooped up in the dorm.

33:39.208 --> 33:43.083
It makes one think
that you're a fugitive or something.

33:44.833 --> 33:45.958
You don't do drugs, do you?

33:47.166 --> 33:48.541
No.

33:51.000 --> 33:51.916
Deep in debts?

33:53.583 --> 33:54.415
No.

33:54.416 --> 34:01.000
ACTOR REZA MALIK IS SLOWLY RECOVERING

34:02.375 --> 34:04.874
Seriously, this is
all they're talking about.

34:04.875 --> 34:07.999
A single scratch is apparently worth
a whole media coverage.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.291
Don't they have anything else?

34:10.000 --> 34:11.999
GOSSIP

34:12.000 --> 34:14.665
Now this is what I'm talking about.

34:14.666 --> 34:17.832
<i>...in secret. It is said that the husband</i>

34:17.833 --> 34:20.499
<i>is the owner of the largest
coal mine in Kalimantan.</i>

34:20.500 --> 34:24.291
<i>I'm no more than just a shadow
and an accessory in your every ambition.</i>

34:27.916 --> 34:29.666
<i>You're not the one.</i>

34:30.583 --> 34:32.290
<i>You wear a crown,</i>

34:32.291 --> 34:34.707
<i>but you remain a commoner at heart.</i>

34:34.708 --> 34:35.958
<i>You're a fake!</i>

34:55.791 --> 34:57.625
What do you guys think?

34:58.416 --> 34:59.291
It's great.

34:59.833 --> 35:01.249
I love it.

35:01.250 --> 35:04.416
Your performances are top-notch.

35:06.916 --> 35:10.041
And I'm glad this movie
brought you two together.

35:12.875 --> 35:16.333
I wish you would no longer
hide your relationship from the public.

35:17.625 --> 35:21.624
Be open to the public.
Let the world know that you are a couple.

35:21.625 --> 35:25.375
A love story that came true.

35:30.708 --> 35:32.333
Let's go, Malik, Ava.

35:40.625 --> 35:42.415
Hello.

35:42.416 --> 35:44.457
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

35:44.458 --> 35:45.540
I'm good.

35:45.541 --> 35:48.875
Such an honor to have both of you here.

35:54.166 --> 35:58.957
But so many people
are against you two dating.

35:58.958 --> 36:01.582
Well, that's okay.

36:01.583 --> 36:05.707
They have the right to their opinion.

36:05.708 --> 36:08.874
<i>I think people say that</i>

36:08.875 --> 36:14.166
<i>because they don't know Ava like I do.</i>

36:15.541 --> 36:19.999
But over time,
I'm sure that they'll understand

36:20.000 --> 36:24.749
why I'd fall for this wonderful woman.

36:24.750 --> 36:26.875
<i>Yes, they're involved with each other.</i>

36:27.458 --> 36:31.249
<i>The chemistry continues off set
after filming</i> Arok & Dedes.

36:31.250 --> 36:34.000
<i>And remember, it's coming out in December.</i>

36:36.208 --> 36:40.749
One word to describe
your hope for this relationship.

36:40.750 --> 36:42.540
No copying each other's answer.

36:42.541 --> 36:45.665
- No giving any sort of code. Okay?
- Okay.

36:45.666 --> 36:48.166
Three, two, one.

36:51.875 --> 36:54.166
Eternal. Why, Ava?

36:54.750 --> 36:56.290
It's just my wish.

36:56.291 --> 36:58.916
It just scares me

36:59.500 --> 37:03.833
how something beautiful
could one day change and...

37:04.958 --> 37:07.375
well, just disappear.

37:09.125 --> 37:12.416
I bet most women feel the same way.
What do you think, Malik?

37:14.000 --> 37:17.750
For me, it's "happy".
Because every relationship

37:18.291 --> 37:20.540
is about finding happiness
with your partner.

37:20.541 --> 37:26.999
And I hope this relationship
will always bring us happiness.

37:27.000 --> 37:32.290
In response to Ava's answer,

37:32.291 --> 37:36.374
I think it's normal to have fear
and to hope for eternity.

37:36.375 --> 37:40.749
And this is my promise to not leave her.

37:40.750 --> 37:42.083
That's it.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.708
<i>A flower arrangement
gives you peace of mind.</i>

37:56.291 --> 37:58.041
<i>Every texture,</i>

37:59.708 --> 38:01.208
<i>composition,</i>

38:02.625 --> 38:04.166
<i>color combination,</i>

38:06.083 --> 38:10.208
is a reflection of harmony
within our lives.

38:11.708 --> 38:17.791
And the Citra Award
for Best Leading Actress goes to...

38:19.416 --> 38:23.000
Ava Alessandra in <i>Arok & Dedes</i>!

38:29.208 --> 38:34.083
<i>I would like to express my gratitude
to my late mother,</i>

38:34.666 --> 38:37.666
<i>who always pushed me to be the best.</i>

38:38.541 --> 38:43.082
A figure who instilled the belief in me
that a life without a father

38:43.083 --> 38:44.875
doesn't mean a life without a future.

38:46.583 --> 38:50.541
This evening, I would like
to dedicate this trophy

38:51.375 --> 38:52.875
to my father,

38:54.166 --> 38:56.416
wherever you are.

38:57.875 --> 39:00.833
Thank you to the jury as well,

39:01.416 --> 39:04.415
my director, Cornelio Sunny,

39:04.416 --> 39:06.790
my producer, Mr. Ranbir,

39:06.791 --> 39:08.250
Reza Malik,

39:08.750 --> 39:12.833
and the whole cast and crew because
I wouldn't be here without all of you.

39:18.083 --> 39:19.875
Any thoughts?

39:56.125 --> 39:58.582
<i>I told you you'd win!</i>

39:58.583 --> 40:00.833
<i>But you didn't believe me.</i>

40:04.458 --> 40:07.750
<i>What's with you? You just won an award.</i>

40:09.541 --> 40:11.750
Oh, dear.

40:15.291 --> 40:16.207
What's wrong?

40:16.208 --> 40:19.791
I've been calling Agus,
but he's not picking up.

40:20.500 --> 40:22.915
Something's bothering you. What's wrong?

40:22.916 --> 40:25.415
I can't believe I'm just
a part of the cast and crew.

40:25.416 --> 40:27.499
No special acknowledgement whatsoever.

40:27.500 --> 40:31.125
You didn't even mention
how you feel about me. Nothing.

40:33.375 --> 40:35.332
I was so nervous. I didn't expect to win.

40:35.333 --> 40:37.415
I was up against Christine Hakim.

40:37.416 --> 40:39.290
You know how I feel about you.

40:39.291 --> 40:41.166
No. Apparently not.

40:41.875 --> 40:43.915
Even Tito got a special mention.

40:43.916 --> 40:46.374
He and I go back a long way.
He discovered me.

40:46.375 --> 40:48.207
But he's rarely on set.

40:48.208 --> 40:49.790
He's not always there for you.

40:49.791 --> 40:53.165
He was not there when
you were struggling with Ken Dedes.

40:53.166 --> 40:54.290
He wasn't there, was he?

40:54.291 --> 40:55.624
- But I was.
- All right.

40:55.625 --> 40:58.333
- Later, at the after part--
- He's just a manager

40:58.916 --> 41:01.124
who's only in it for the money.
That's it. You understand?

41:01.125 --> 41:03.790
Look, at the after party,
I'll ask Mr. Ranbir

41:03.791 --> 41:05.332
- for another speech--
- Don't bother.

41:05.333 --> 41:06.915
Just go by yourself.

41:06.916 --> 41:09.249
I'm going home. I have a shoot tomorrow.

41:09.250 --> 41:10.874
If you're not going, then I'm not going.

41:10.875 --> 41:13.165
No, please go.
Everyone expects you to come.

41:13.166 --> 41:14.582
I can tell them I'm not feeling well.

41:14.583 --> 41:18.832
- So, you'll lie because of me?
- I lie because I don't want to be there.

41:18.833 --> 41:19.832
By yourself.

41:19.833 --> 41:22.207
- But you'll go if I go.
- Of course!

41:22.208 --> 41:23.999
Please don't make this complicated!

41:24.000 --> 41:25.457
What? No!

41:25.458 --> 41:27.250
I'm not making this complicated. You are.

41:30.291 --> 41:31.875
Good grief.

41:37.333 --> 41:38.499
Hey, you're asleep?

41:38.500 --> 41:40.165
- Do I pay you to sleep?
- No, sir.

41:40.166 --> 41:41.832
I've been calling you, for God's sake.
Open the door!

41:41.833 --> 41:43.083
Yes, sir.

41:44.208 --> 41:45.499
I'm sorry, sir.

41:45.500 --> 41:46.665
Ma'am, come in.

41:46.666 --> 41:49.665
- I've been trying to reach you.
- Yes, I'm sorry, sir.

41:49.666 --> 41:51.041
Idiot.

42:03.583 --> 42:04.583
Babe.

42:05.166 --> 42:08.000
I wouldn't have gotten this award
if it weren't for you.

42:08.833 --> 42:10.625
This is your win, too.

42:11.541 --> 42:13.957
The jury should think so too.

42:13.958 --> 42:15.708
I didn't even get nominated.

42:16.791 --> 42:20.082
I asked Garin when I ran into him.

42:20.083 --> 42:20.999
Why would you ask him?

42:21.000 --> 42:23.375
He's the head of the jury.

42:24.083 --> 42:25.040
I didn't ask you to.

42:25.041 --> 42:27.208
I was just wondering
why you weren't nominated.

42:30.208 --> 42:31.041
What did he say?

42:33.083 --> 42:35.665
Garin actually vouched for you,

42:35.666 --> 42:37.500
but the others disagreed.

42:38.958 --> 42:42.958
Really? How sad
that they have such low standards.

42:43.541 --> 42:44.624
Well, it can't be helped.

42:44.625 --> 42:48.166
It didn't even register to them
how hard it was to be Ken Arok.

42:48.666 --> 42:51.290
And to build chemistry with you
on top of that?

42:51.291 --> 42:53.750
They have no idea
how much I struggled on set.

42:54.875 --> 42:56.707
Stop snooping! Go!

42:56.708 --> 42:57.999
- Sorry, sir.
- Who are you waiting for?

42:58.000 --> 42:59.833
- Yes, sir.
- Idiot.

43:00.541 --> 43:01.957
Where to, sir?

43:01.958 --> 43:03.416
Wherever the hell you want!

43:04.083 --> 43:05.790
Just head home. I'll go home by myself.

43:05.791 --> 43:08.582
- Close the door! For God's sake!
- Yes, sir.

43:08.583 --> 43:10.333
Yes, sir. Closing the door, sir.

43:11.166 --> 43:13.208
- You want to sleep?
- No, sir. I want to work.

43:32.083 --> 43:33.083
May!

43:39.958 --> 43:41.624
We're in luck!

43:41.625 --> 43:43.125
You got one, too.

43:46.041 --> 43:49.374
I can't believe
such a generous person still exists.

43:49.375 --> 43:51.082
Not to mention handsome.

43:51.083 --> 43:52.708
Who gave you this?

43:53.208 --> 43:55.583
Mr. Raga. Room 718.

43:57.750 --> 43:59.041
None for me, thank you.

43:59.666 --> 44:01.999
Why not? I thought you liked nasi uduk.

44:02.000 --> 44:03.708
Mr. Raga said so.

44:04.708 --> 44:06.458
Look, it has your name on it.

44:09.833 --> 44:14.666
I'm still not really sure why
he walked up to me and gave us this.

44:15.541 --> 44:19.625
He said to thank you
for letting him know about this nasi uduk.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.041
You really aren't going to eat it?

44:30.458 --> 44:34.165
Oh, please, Maya. It's just nasi uduk.

44:34.166 --> 44:37.790
It’s not like he’s trying
to buy you or something.

44:37.791 --> 44:38.958
It's really good.

44:42.375 --> 44:45.208
I could've picked you up at the airport
if I knew it was your day off.

44:48.583 --> 44:52.583
It wasn't supposed to be.
That's why Tito agreed to this photoshoot.

44:55.291 --> 44:56.583
We're done. Thank you.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.416
He didn't tell me your flight schedule.

45:03.291 --> 45:05.207
Really? I asked him to.

45:05.208 --> 45:08.458
He did, but it was so last minute.
You've probably landed already.

45:09.208 --> 45:11.208
He seems quite possessive.

45:15.916 --> 45:17.708
I honestly don't get it.

45:18.291 --> 45:20.458
You're just imagining things.

45:21.500 --> 45:23.291
The photoshoot is starting soon, Ava.

45:24.166 --> 45:25.665
Give us a moment.

45:25.666 --> 45:28.582
- It's been delayed for 30 minutes.
- It shouldn't be a problem.

45:28.583 --> 45:31.291
Everyone will listen to Ava's manager.

45:32.541 --> 45:33.832
Just make it work.

45:33.833 --> 45:35.458
I'm ready, Tito. Let's go.

45:42.166 --> 45:43.416
I'll be right back.

45:59.791 --> 46:02.499
You have to deal with Malik.

46:02.500 --> 46:05.832
What you just did was very unprofessional.

46:05.833 --> 46:08.791
If only you gave him access, right, Tito?

46:09.750 --> 46:12.041
- Good day, everyone.
- Good day.

46:14.875 --> 46:16.916
<i>For me, acting is not pretending.</i>

46:17.958 --> 46:19.707
<i>Acting needs honesty,</i>

46:19.708 --> 46:23.583
<i>so that we can fully understand
the characters we try to portray.</i>

46:24.791 --> 46:29.375
<i>Wouldn't you get them mixed up?
Reality and imagination.</i>

46:30.083 --> 46:31.165
<i>Well, no.</i>

46:31.166 --> 46:34.290
Just like that time I played Ken Dedes,

46:34.291 --> 46:37.624
she was my reality when I was on set.

46:37.625 --> 46:40.707
I put away my life as Ava for a while.

46:40.708 --> 46:43.790
So, your relationship with Malik,

46:43.791 --> 46:46.208
was it a reality
or just a promotional gimmick?

46:48.625 --> 46:49.916
What do you think?

46:50.625 --> 46:53.457
It was pretty convincing.

46:53.458 --> 46:58.250
But you know Malik has a history
of dating his co-stars, right?

46:59.083 --> 47:00.416
Any other questions?

47:06.500 --> 47:09.041
Sorry, she's uncomfortable.

47:12.208 --> 47:13.083
Sorry.

47:37.250 --> 47:39.333
Is it always this hard to get to know you?

47:41.583 --> 47:42.499
Sorry.

47:42.500 --> 47:45.916
We're not allowed to interact
with hotel guests during working hours.

47:47.750 --> 47:49.333
What about after?

47:50.625 --> 47:51.500
Excuse me.

48:09.458 --> 48:11.499
- There she is. One moment, sir.
- Yes, go ahead.

48:11.500 --> 48:12.625
Maya!

48:13.666 --> 48:14.625
Maya!

48:20.666 --> 48:21.541
May!

48:22.916 --> 48:26.332
Mr. Raga asked you to show him
Mr. Zainal's nasi uduk place.

48:26.333 --> 48:27.791
The one in the alleyway.

48:32.250 --> 48:34.790
Can't you take him instead?
I'm going home.

48:34.791 --> 48:38.208
I can't. I'm going out with Dadang.

48:39.458 --> 48:41.582
Office hours are over.

48:41.583 --> 48:42.957
Just take it easy.

48:42.958 --> 48:43.875
Okay?

48:44.541 --> 48:45.790
Sir!

48:45.791 --> 48:47.957
She's ready to take you.

48:47.958 --> 48:50.290
- Thanks.
- Excuse me.

48:50.291 --> 48:51.333
Let's go, Dang.

49:11.958 --> 49:14.166
You look uncomfortable
eating here with me.

49:16.000 --> 49:17.291
I'm sorry.

49:17.833 --> 49:20.415
I really want to get to know you.

49:20.416 --> 49:21.916
I have no friends here.

49:24.625 --> 49:28.250
If you're looking for a friend,
it doesn't have to be me.

49:30.041 --> 49:34.833
Consider this an apology
for scaring you back then.

49:36.916 --> 49:38.458
- Enjoy, sir, miss.
- Thank you.

49:45.208 --> 49:46.041
You look familiar.

49:49.291 --> 49:51.333
Have we met before?

49:52.500 --> 49:54.832
You ordered chicken breast, didn't you?

49:54.833 --> 49:57.000
- Yes.
- They mixed it up.

49:59.916 --> 50:03.416
May I ask what you do for a living?

50:04.500 --> 50:05.749
I work in finance.

50:05.750 --> 50:09.333
I handle M&A, mergers and acquisitions.

50:10.666 --> 50:12.707
I used to be in risk management.

50:12.708 --> 50:16.166
I was a partner
in a private equity in Auckland.

50:16.708 --> 50:20.000
M&A is more about...

50:21.041 --> 50:22.375
buying and selling companies.

50:24.125 --> 50:25.000
Like now,

50:26.125 --> 50:30.040
we're in the process
of acquiring a mining company...

50:30.041 --> 50:32.083
Yes, I understand.

50:39.166 --> 50:41.250
<i>We've only been talking
about me all night.</i>

50:42.666 --> 50:45.208
My life story is nothing interesting.

50:47.500 --> 50:50.916
It's okay if you don't want
to talk about it.

50:52.083 --> 50:54.375
I'm glad to have someone
to "nguduk" together.

50:56.291 --> 50:57.541
What's "nguduk"?

50:58.291 --> 51:00.250
You know, eat some nasi uduk.

51:05.458 --> 51:07.624
Va! What?

51:07.625 --> 51:09.208
Maya!

51:17.500 --> 51:19.708
Sir, you can go ahead.
I have something else to do.

51:21.125 --> 51:22.291
Oh, okay.

51:28.750 --> 51:30.000
Maya?

51:39.375 --> 51:41.290
<i>Lives in New Zealand.</i>

51:41.291 --> 51:43.291
<i>Finance guy.</i>

51:45.500 --> 51:46.583
<i>Is he single?</i>

51:50.375 --> 51:51.665
It seems so.

51:51.666 --> 51:53.540
What do you mean "seems"?

51:53.541 --> 51:55.749
Hey! Is he single or not?

51:55.750 --> 51:57.915
- I really don't know.
- Is he?

51:57.916 --> 51:59.999
- I have no idea.
- Is he single?

52:00.000 --> 52:01.791
I'll ask him later.

52:10.208 --> 52:11.333
What about...

52:12.625 --> 52:13.833
the other problem?

52:16.958 --> 52:18.125
It's gone viral.

52:20.166 --> 52:22.916
This is not why I asked you to meet up.

52:23.875 --> 52:27.291
Okay. Sorry.

52:28.416 --> 52:30.083
I'm sorry, Ms. Maya.

52:34.875 --> 52:36.250
So, what's his name again?

52:37.750 --> 52:38.708
What is it?

52:39.625 --> 52:41.082
Ra... who?

52:41.083 --> 52:43.665
- Ra...
- Ra. Ga.

52:43.666 --> 52:45.124
- Who? Raja?
- Raga!

52:45.125 --> 52:46.375
Raga!

52:47.083 --> 52:48.915
I see. And his surname?

52:48.916 --> 52:50.041
You don't know?

52:50.958 --> 52:52.125
You don't?

52:55.375 --> 52:57.707
<i>Hi, guys. Welcome back to Z-Vlogs.</i>

52:57.708 --> 53:00.999
<i>As we know, Ava Alessandra's
latest movie,</i> Satu Kata,

53:01.000 --> 53:05.207
<i>is released back-to-back
with Reza Malik's</i> Operasi Samudera.

53:05.208 --> 53:07.624
- <i>Which means, this couple's movies</i>
- Do you really have to watch it now?

53:07.625 --> 53:08.999
<i>will compete with each other.</i>

53:09.000 --> 53:10.040
- <i>How do you think it will turn out?</i>
- Those things are the reason

53:10.041 --> 53:11.333
Indonesian movies flunk hard.

53:13.625 --> 53:15.749
I don't pay much attention to it.
I'm just curious.

53:15.750 --> 53:17.332
Because they're praising you, right?

53:17.333 --> 53:20.791
No. I've got my share of bad reviews.

53:21.666 --> 53:24.624
You're the one who told me
not to take harsh comments personally.

53:24.625 --> 53:27.915
But that's a personal attack.

53:27.916 --> 53:30.290
I don't know how those idiots think.

53:30.291 --> 53:32.499
They claim to be reviewers
while knowing nothing

53:32.500 --> 53:36.249
about how we worked ourselves to death
behind the scene.

53:36.250 --> 53:38.790
Do they think it's easy
to act in front of a green screen?

53:38.791 --> 53:40.540
I spent months
working on those fighting scenes.

53:40.541 --> 53:41.958
They'll never know how I exhausted myself.

53:42.625 --> 53:43.832
- They do nothing but comment.
- Hey.

53:43.833 --> 53:46.833
I know how you worked really hard.

53:47.541 --> 53:48.790
Don't be so snappy, okay?

53:48.791 --> 53:50.875
I'm not. I'm just saying.

53:52.583 --> 53:53.958
It's starting.

53:59.541 --> 54:00.791
Okay, the next look.

54:03.916 --> 54:05.207
- Right here?
- Yes.

54:05.208 --> 54:06.583
Good. Ready?

54:07.375 --> 54:09.165
Three, two, one.

54:09.166 --> 54:11.625
Good. One more. Three, two, one.

54:16.416 --> 54:17.583
Good.

54:20.916 --> 54:22.416
More of that. Good.

54:23.708 --> 54:26.332
Babe. You're quite tense.

54:26.333 --> 54:28.750
Be more relaxed.

54:29.375 --> 54:30.708
Okay? Smile.

54:31.708 --> 54:32.583
Keep going.

54:33.166 --> 54:34.583
There you go.

54:35.125 --> 54:37.833
Hey, sorry. This side of her hair.

54:39.375 --> 54:40.666
- Hair!
- Fix it.

54:42.958 --> 54:43.791
Miss.

54:44.791 --> 54:45.750
Just a touch.

54:47.041 --> 54:48.333
- Try...
- Malik...

54:49.291 --> 54:50.665
He's the photographer.

54:50.666 --> 54:55.458
We have the creative agency
and the client here.

54:56.416 --> 54:58.415
They know what they're doing.

54:58.416 --> 55:00.041
Please give them some space.

55:01.250 --> 55:02.290
For Ava.

55:02.291 --> 55:03.915
I know what I'm doing, too.

55:03.916 --> 55:05.041
Please wait outside.

56:03.958 --> 56:04.833
Open the door.

56:05.875 --> 56:07.750
What are you doing? Open up!

56:09.375 --> 56:10.250
Open the door.

56:12.833 --> 56:14.790
Hey! Open it. Open the door!

56:14.791 --> 56:17.291
Hey, open it! Open the door!

56:45.708 --> 56:47.415
- Housekeeping!
- Yes. Just a second.

56:47.416 --> 56:48.500
Come in!

56:53.250 --> 56:54.499
<i>Just go...</i>

56:54.500 --> 56:55.500
Come in.

56:58.041 --> 56:58.875
Wait there for a bit.

57:09.083 --> 57:09.916
Yeah...

57:10.791 --> 57:13.666
<i>May, wait a bit.
I'll talk to you after this.</i>

57:16.541 --> 57:18.333
<i>May, we need to talk.</i>

57:19.916 --> 57:20.957
May! Wait.

57:20.958 --> 57:22.791
Yes, wait.

57:24.000 --> 57:24.916
Maya, hold on.

57:35.583 --> 57:36.541
Maya?

57:37.666 --> 57:38.500
May?

57:42.416 --> 57:43.250
May?

57:44.416 --> 57:45.250
May!

57:46.000 --> 57:46.875
Maya!

57:48.958 --> 57:49.833
Maya!

58:15.291 --> 58:16.291
Which room?

58:17.666 --> 58:18.666
There it is!

58:20.166 --> 58:21.000
Hang on.

58:23.625 --> 58:24.708
Mr. Raga.

58:25.791 --> 58:26.999
Why are you here?

58:27.000 --> 58:28.665
I'm looking for Maya.

58:28.666 --> 58:31.124
She's in the laundry room.

58:31.125 --> 58:33.707
You can't be here, sir. It's staff only.

58:33.708 --> 58:35.165
Oh, sorry.

58:35.166 --> 58:36.083
Okay.

58:42.166 --> 58:44.790
How badly have you been hurt, Maya,

58:44.791 --> 58:46.416
for you to be this traumatized?

58:47.625 --> 58:48.874
What do you mean?

58:48.875 --> 58:51.833
I'm talking about Mr. Raga.

58:52.416 --> 58:53.875
He keeps asking about you.

58:54.375 --> 58:57.000
He's wondering what he did wrong.

58:57.708 --> 58:59.166
Because you keep avoiding him.

59:00.916 --> 59:03.707
I just want to work here.

59:03.708 --> 59:04.915
Listen, Maya.

59:04.916 --> 59:08.999
People like us will mostly
end up with people like Dadang,

59:09.000 --> 59:10.041
who buys motorbikes in installments.

59:10.666 --> 59:13.250
Who can't even afford
to spend a night here.

59:14.291 --> 59:18.582
Now, someone manly and well-off
shows an interest in you,

59:18.583 --> 59:20.499
but you turn him down.

59:20.500 --> 59:22.999
I don't want it messing up my job.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.583
You can't be serious.

59:26.958 --> 59:29.749
We're in housekeeping.

59:29.750 --> 59:32.375
We deal with messes,
whether we like it or not.

59:33.166 --> 59:34.250
Don't be stupid, Maya.

59:37.000 --> 59:38.540
If you really end up with him,

59:38.541 --> 59:41.832
your job here will be
the last thing you worry about.

59:41.833 --> 59:46.082
Your life will turn upside down.

59:46.083 --> 59:47.624
The next time you're here,

59:47.625 --> 59:50.750
you'll be welcomed from every direction.

59:52.125 --> 59:57.875
Who knows, I'll probably
be the one cleaning your room.

59:59.666 --> 01:00:00.875
I don't mind at all.

01:00:01.708 --> 01:00:03.000
As long as you leave me a huge tip.

01:00:09.291 --> 01:00:13.125
I just can't stand
seeing you sad all the time.

01:00:14.541 --> 01:00:16.041
But I'm happy.

01:00:17.208 --> 01:00:20.333
You seriously think
that face screams happy?

01:00:23.416 --> 01:00:27.750
You're going to regret it once he leaves.

01:01:13.875 --> 01:01:15.458
Unlock the door. I'm getting out.

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:19.625
Come on, now. Why are you so angry?

01:01:20.291 --> 01:01:22.999
I just miss the old us.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.583
The talking, the sharing.

01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:29.083
I love you. Really.

01:01:31.125 --> 01:01:32.874
Instagram live? Are you out of your mind?

01:01:32.875 --> 01:01:33.874
It's just a joke.

01:01:33.875 --> 01:01:36.624
No need to act like this!
Stop being dramatic.

01:01:36.625 --> 01:01:37.582
Ava, stop!

01:01:37.583 --> 01:01:38.749
If you keep this up,

01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:41.082
- Shut up!
- I get why your father left you!

01:01:41.083 --> 01:01:42.957
- Out of the way!
- Try some patience, moron!

01:01:42.958 --> 01:01:44.250
Out of the way!

01:01:51.625 --> 01:01:54.790
- Hello.
- <i>Ava, where are you?</i>

01:01:54.791 --> 01:01:56.125
<i>Are you okay?</i>

01:01:56.791 --> 01:01:59.333
I'm okay, Tito. Lara will pick me up.

01:02:00.041 --> 01:02:03.250
<i>The reporters won’t stop hounding us!</i>

01:02:04.375 --> 01:02:06.250
Please handle it for me.

01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:08.375
Thank you.

01:02:09.375 --> 01:02:10.750
<i>Alright then.</i>

01:02:25.541 --> 01:02:27.333
<i>It's going viral already, Va.</i>

01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:32.583
<i>You see now?</i>

01:02:33.708 --> 01:02:36.208
<i>I've told you he's a jerk.</i>

01:02:38.666 --> 01:02:40.541
He's toxic for you.

01:02:54.291 --> 01:02:55.791
Where will you go now?

01:04:50.458 --> 01:04:52.291
It's the promise to ourselves

01:04:53.083 --> 01:04:54.916
that we tend to break.

01:06:41.125 --> 01:06:43.083
Are you seriously gonna wear that?

01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:50.915
You're not going to the store
for some noodles, Maya.

01:06:50.916 --> 01:06:53.249
You're going on a date with Mr. Raga.

01:06:53.250 --> 01:06:54.625
No one's going on a date.

01:06:56.125 --> 01:06:58.750
Two people going out at night...
That's a date.

01:07:02.083 --> 01:07:04.541
Wait here. Let me get my clothes.

01:07:12.708 --> 01:07:16.207
That looks so much better.

01:07:16.208 --> 01:07:18.332
It fits you.

01:07:18.333 --> 01:07:19.833
Don't you think so?

01:07:22.791 --> 01:07:24.208
Whose clothes are these?

01:07:26.208 --> 01:07:28.041
A guest left it in her room.

01:07:28.625 --> 01:07:29.791
Zip it.

01:07:31.875 --> 01:07:34.124
Should I just rent this out?

01:07:34.125 --> 01:07:37.457
Just 100,000 for the laundry.

01:07:37.458 --> 01:07:38.541
Okay?

01:07:40.833 --> 01:07:43.249
Your face is flawless.

01:07:43.250 --> 01:07:45.250
- Do you get facials?
- No.

01:07:45.791 --> 01:07:49.041
- Look at that smudge. Let me clean it.
- No. It's okay.

01:07:52.166 --> 01:07:53.208
I should get going.

01:08:10.708 --> 01:08:11.540
Okay.

01:08:11.541 --> 01:08:12.875
One more try.

01:08:51.541 --> 01:08:52.958
You're pretty good at bowling.

01:08:56.375 --> 01:08:58.707
Do you play often, or...

01:08:58.708 --> 01:09:00.291
Sometimes.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.958
I've never met a girl like you before.

01:09:16.875 --> 01:09:18.875
What kind of girl do you mean?

01:09:23.708 --> 01:09:24.666
Just different.

01:09:30.458 --> 01:09:31.791
You're true to yourself.

01:09:37.291 --> 01:09:38.541
Authentic.

01:09:41.958 --> 01:09:44.333
And so hard to be taken out on a date.

01:10:15.916 --> 01:10:18.875
<i>Despite the variety of shapes and colors,</i>

01:10:20.125 --> 01:10:23.541
<i>they are there to compliment each other.</i>

01:10:24.666 --> 01:10:27.000
Harmony will come to life

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.541
once each element finds its place.

01:10:32.125 --> 01:10:34.375
When it's the right time to move forward

01:10:36.041 --> 01:10:38.166
and when it's the right time to step back.

01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:48.000
<i>When all parts fulfill
each of their purpose,</i>

01:10:50.083 --> 01:10:52.583
<i>we shall experience its beauty.</i>

01:10:53.958 --> 01:10:56.583
<i>We will find inner peace.</i>

01:10:57.833 --> 01:10:59.125
<i>Tranquility.</i>

01:11:01.583 --> 01:11:05.333
<i>Happiness will flow all over us
like water.</i>

01:11:07.375 --> 01:11:09.875
<i>This is the purpose of our work.</i>

01:11:38.875 --> 01:11:40.500
Happy anniversary, my dear.

01:11:45.875 --> 01:11:47.375
Happy anniversary, love.

01:11:52.375 --> 01:11:54.125
To our marriage.

01:11:55.166 --> 01:11:56.541
May it last forever.

01:11:58.041 --> 01:12:00.458
To a harmonious and happy life forever.

01:12:15.375 --> 01:12:16.500
Five years.

01:12:18.291 --> 01:12:21.083
Five things I've learned about you.

01:12:23.666 --> 01:12:26.541
Five things that drive you up the wall.

01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:32.083
Your late mother.

01:12:34.375 --> 01:12:35.625
Your job.

01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:39.583
Your favorite meal.

01:12:41.916 --> 01:12:43.375
Your infertility.

01:12:49.166 --> 01:12:50.375
And the fifth one?

01:12:52.625 --> 01:12:54.708
The last one is my love for Ikebana.

01:12:57.291 --> 01:13:00.541
The profession you refer to as "florist".

01:13:02.916 --> 01:13:04.500
You got it wrong on the last one.

01:13:06.458 --> 01:13:07.958
If I hated it,

01:13:10.375 --> 01:13:12.250
your workshop would've been long gone.

01:13:19.250 --> 01:13:20.375
Maybe not yet.

01:13:32.666 --> 01:13:33.625
Ava.

01:13:34.291 --> 01:13:36.415
I'm really sorry. I was wrong.

01:13:36.416 --> 01:13:38.000
Please listen to me.

01:13:39.625 --> 01:13:43.249
I was harsh to you.
I was tasteless. I was childish.

01:13:43.250 --> 01:13:45.874
But I was in no way trying to hurt you.

01:13:45.875 --> 01:13:48.124
Look at me. I need to say this.

01:13:48.125 --> 01:13:49.291
Just for a moment.

01:13:54.708 --> 01:13:56.375
When you walked away, I panicked.

01:13:58.375 --> 01:14:00.625
I can't lose you, Ava.

01:14:01.541 --> 01:14:02.500
I love you so much.

01:14:04.791 --> 01:14:07.041
Please don't leave me.

01:14:07.541 --> 01:14:08.375
Please.

01:14:21.583 --> 01:14:24.583
I'm not your mother
who left you at the orphanage.

01:14:25.666 --> 01:14:27.582
I'm not her.

01:14:27.583 --> 01:14:28.791
Shut up!

01:14:32.916 --> 01:14:34.625
You turned me into a monster.

01:14:35.458 --> 01:14:39.166
You're the sick one, Raisa. Not me.

01:15:02.416 --> 01:15:03.791
You missed a line.

01:15:15.583 --> 01:15:17.208
Should we break,
or can we do another take?

01:15:18.208 --> 01:15:19.708
I need some time.

01:15:23.625 --> 01:15:24.582
Let's take a break.

01:15:24.583 --> 01:15:26.290
We'll reset in a moment.

01:15:26.291 --> 01:15:27.458
Okay.

01:16:32.166 --> 01:16:33.166
What was that?

01:16:34.083 --> 01:16:35.083
What happened?

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.333
Now, calm down.

01:16:43.625 --> 01:16:45.375
Wipe your tears.

01:16:47.166 --> 01:16:49.999
Go back to set and finish the shoot.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.041
That's it.

01:16:53.625 --> 01:16:56.582
- See how Raisa breaks free from Iman?
- We're not Raisa...

01:16:56.583 --> 01:16:58.874
- Three years, I've been such a naive fool!
- We're not Raisa and Iman.

01:16:58.875 --> 01:17:00.290
- I didn't learn from my mother.
- This isn't about the roles we play!

01:17:00.291 --> 01:17:02.166
Stop with that pointless
method acting of yours!

01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:04.791
It's so pretentious.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.208
You've been living
in your own fictional world.

01:17:09.083 --> 01:17:10.916
This isn't the first time
you act this way.

01:17:12.333 --> 01:17:14.582
- You're here because of me!
- I don't care!

01:17:14.583 --> 01:17:17.457
This Ava wouldn't exist
if it weren't for you.

01:17:17.458 --> 01:17:19.665
But I refuse to live with the same trauma!

01:17:19.666 --> 01:17:22.583
You're not Raisa, and I'm not Iman.
Do you understand?

01:17:26.458 --> 01:17:27.916
- Malik, we're starting.
- Okay.

01:17:28.416 --> 01:17:29.291
I got it.

01:17:35.791 --> 01:17:37.291
I think there's a problem.

01:17:38.958 --> 01:17:39.958
Right?

01:17:41.458 --> 01:17:42.708
Okay.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.082
Okay, should we start now?

01:17:50.083 --> 01:17:51.500
- Okay.
- You're okay?

01:17:53.291 --> 01:17:56.249
Okay. So, we're using the take
from earlier,

01:17:56.250 --> 01:17:59.207
but we're starting with the scene
before Iman stabs Raisa.

01:17:59.208 --> 01:18:00.624
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:18:00.625 --> 01:18:03.749
Shall I do the same move?

01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:05.125
Whatever suits you.

01:18:06.458 --> 01:18:07.957
Art department!

01:18:07.958 --> 01:18:09.083
The knife, please.

01:18:09.958 --> 01:18:12.124
- It's a dummy, right?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:18:12.125 --> 01:18:14.082
- All right.
- Okay.

01:18:14.083 --> 01:18:15.665
Okay. Ready?

01:18:15.666 --> 01:18:17.208
All set!

01:18:27.958 --> 01:18:29.416
Slate 948, take three.

01:18:50.250 --> 01:18:51.082
- Cut.
- Medic!

01:18:51.083 --> 01:18:52.875
- Get the medic! Hurry!
- Hey!

01:18:53.375 --> 01:18:54.875
Wait...

01:18:56.583 --> 01:18:57.915
Hey, stop rolling!

01:18:57.916 --> 01:18:59.791
Why are you filming this?

01:19:27.416 --> 01:19:29.416
What's the name?

01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:48.874
Ms. Ava, the penthouse
is on the 18th floor, as usual.

01:19:48.875 --> 01:19:51.540
Booked for you until the end of the month.

Please make sure I'm incognito.

01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:55.874
Yes, ma'am. Incognito.

01:19:55.875 --> 01:19:56.958

you have another panic attack.

01:25:23.083 --> 01:25:24.666
Okay, let's try it.

01:25:27.041 --> 01:25:29.208
What is your favorite city?

01:25:30.375 --> 01:25:31.291
Bandung.

01:25:33.291 --> 01:25:35.791
What is your unfulfilled wish?

01:25:40.166 --> 01:25:41.083
To be happy.

01:25:44.166 --> 01:25:46.166
What do you enjoy most?

01:25:48.583 --> 01:25:50.124
Acting in front of...

01:25:50.125 --> 01:25:51.541
I mean bowling.

01:25:56.083 --> 01:25:58.583
When was the last time you fell in love?

01:26:02.791 --> 01:26:03.875
Sorry.

01:26:05.416 --> 01:26:06.583
I shouldn't have asked that.

01:26:08.041 --> 01:26:09.208
No problem.

01:26:22.916 --> 01:26:24.708
But if you want to talk, I'll listen.

01:26:27.291 --> 01:26:28.583
It's not important.

01:26:30.708 --> 01:26:31.666
It is important.

01:26:35.958 --> 01:26:37.500
It reminds me of my childhood.

01:26:40.250 --> 01:26:44.375
<i>As kids, there were
a gazillion things we didn't know.</i>

01:26:47.375 --> 01:26:49.791
<i>How planes stay afloat
despite their weight.</i>

01:26:52.041 --> 01:26:53.291
<i>Why don't clouds fall to the earth?</i>

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.415
<i>Why it rains.</i>

01:26:57.416 --> 01:26:58.625
Sir, hold on.

01:27:00.916 --> 01:27:05.916
<i>But as we get older, it seems like
those questions lose their importance</i>

01:27:08.375 --> 01:27:10.833
<i>and turn into complicated ones.</i>

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:12.958
<i>Like what?</i>

01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:17.916
Like...

01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:21.708
Why am I here with you?

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:50.708
I'm always happy when I'm with you.

01:27:53.291 --> 01:27:54.833
<i>You make things different.</i>

01:28:05.666 --> 01:28:06.583
Come here!

01:28:14.625 --> 01:28:16.958
<i>Thanks for being there for me
when I'm lonely.</i>

01:28:30.083 --> 01:28:32.040
Excuse me. Good evening.

01:28:32.041 --> 01:28:33.540
Oh, hello.

01:28:33.541 --> 01:28:34.875
May I help you, sir?

01:28:35.875 --> 01:28:37.040
I'm a guest at the hotel.

01:28:37.041 --> 01:28:39.582
For guests,
please use the front gate, sir.

01:28:39.583 --> 01:28:40.500
Sorry.

01:28:41.291 --> 01:28:42.916
It's okay. I'll be fine from here.

01:30:07.791 --> 01:30:08.999
Do you know why

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:13.415
they never let us clean
the Presidential Suite

01:30:13.416 --> 01:30:15.291
ever since you started working here?

01:30:16.791 --> 01:30:20.166
You said someone is renting it monthly.

01:30:21.916 --> 01:30:22.833
Guess who.

01:30:24.416 --> 01:30:26.000
No, who?

01:30:26.875 --> 01:30:28.333
- Thank you, sir.
- Sure.

01:30:32.833 --> 01:30:34.208
Sir, just drop me off right here.

01:30:36.666 --> 01:30:38.707
Hold on. I left something.

01:30:38.708 --> 01:30:39.708
Sir!

01:30:43.416 --> 01:30:45.291
I left something inside.

01:30:57.458 --> 01:31:00.916
Apparently, she's hiding there.

01:31:01.541 --> 01:31:05.375
She got involved in a case
of assault against her boyfriend.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:07.916
I see.

01:31:10.250 --> 01:31:12.833
Is that all you want to say?

01:31:14.166 --> 01:31:17.707
Some people came here,
including her boyfriend,

01:31:17.708 --> 01:31:19.457
looking for her.

01:31:19.458 --> 01:31:21.250
When they checked her room,

01:31:21.833 --> 01:31:22.790
she wasn't there.

01:31:22.791 --> 01:31:25.250
She's gone. Everyone was at a loss.

01:31:30.166 --> 01:31:31.957
It's late. Aren't you sleepy?

01:31:31.958 --> 01:31:32.875
I am.

01:31:33.375 --> 01:31:34.791
But I'm not done.

01:31:35.791 --> 01:31:38.291
Then I looked up the news about her.

01:31:39.583 --> 01:31:41.958
Turns out, her mother used to work here.

01:31:43.125 --> 01:31:44.666
As a housekeeping staff, too, no less.

01:31:54.041 --> 01:31:54.916
You...

01:31:56.500 --> 01:31:58.041
must be Ava Alessandra.

01:32:03.541 --> 01:32:04.708
Trust me,

01:32:05.625 --> 01:32:08.000
I'm your only friend here.

01:32:21.583 --> 01:32:24.915
Holy crap! You really are Ava Alessandra!

01:32:24.916 --> 01:32:26.124
This is insane!

01:32:26.125 --> 01:32:28.582
All this time I’ve been working
with a movie star!

01:32:28.583 --> 01:32:31.374
Cleaning the bathroom,
scrubbing the toilet.

01:32:31.375 --> 01:32:32.874
Freaking unbelievable.

01:32:32.875 --> 01:32:35.499
Man! You're such a good actress!

01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:37.915
You fooled us all!

01:32:37.916 --> 01:32:40.415
The HR department, me, Mr. Raga!

01:32:40.416 --> 01:32:41.875
Dang!

01:32:50.833 --> 01:32:51.833
May.

01:33:11.833 --> 01:33:14.791
- Raga, I can explain.
- It's not your fault.

01:33:20.666 --> 01:33:23.041
It's my fault to think
that you were different.

01:33:31.458 --> 01:33:32.875
I'm here to get my jacket.

01:33:58.458 --> 01:34:01.000
<i>...just in case
you have another panic attack.</i>

01:34:15.666 --> 01:34:17.083
<i>Acting in front of...</i>

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:19.208
<i>I mean bowling.</i>

01:34:20.375 --> 01:34:22.375
<i>When was the last time you fell in love?</i>

01:34:23.875 --> 01:34:26.000
<i>What is your unfulfilled wish?</i>

01:34:27.458 --> 01:34:28.666
<i>To be happy.</i>

01:34:29.250 --> 01:34:31.291
<i>What is your unfulfilled wish?</i>

01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:34.000
<i>To be happy.</i>

01:34:34.583 --> 01:34:36.625
<i>What is your unfulfilled wish?</i>

01:34:38.166 --> 01:34:39.208
<i>To be happy.</i>

01:34:39.958 --> 01:34:41.750
<i>What is your unfulfilled wish?</i>

01:34:43.458 --> 01:34:44.500
<i>To be happy.</i>

01:34:53.541 --> 01:34:57.166
RAGA ASSAD: MAYA, THANK YOU
FOR ACCOMPANYING ME TO DINNER

01:35:06.166 --> 01:35:08.958
You need to be fair
to your own feelings, Va.

01:35:09.875 --> 01:35:10.958
What do you mean?

01:35:16.541 --> 01:35:19.165
Ever since we started being friends,

01:35:19.166 --> 01:35:22.250
and I've always been
your faithful listener,

01:35:25.833 --> 01:35:28.166
I've always wanted to say something.

01:35:30.625 --> 01:35:32.624
But I've been keeping it to myself

01:35:32.625 --> 01:35:35.875
because I didn't want you
to feel like you're being judged

01:35:36.458 --> 01:35:37.916
by your best friend.

01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:45.166
You're being too harsh on yourself.

01:35:49.166 --> 01:35:54.083
You have this unresolved childhood wound
that you've been clutching on to,

01:35:54.583 --> 01:35:56.207
but never try to resolve.

01:35:56.208 --> 01:35:58.207
I don't know how to resolve it.
I've tried therapy, but...

01:35:58.208 --> 01:36:01.708
Have you tried
actually meeting your father?

01:36:02.666 --> 01:36:04.541
Find him. Confront him.

01:36:08.083 --> 01:36:10.000
If the therapy didn't work...

01:36:12.125 --> 01:36:15.957
that's because all you did
was to write letters to your younger self.

01:36:15.958 --> 01:36:17.458
To your past self.

01:36:18.583 --> 01:36:21.083
But then, what?

01:36:21.958 --> 01:36:25.500
They didn't ask you to find the truth.

01:36:29.833 --> 01:36:32.291
Well, I'm no therapist.

01:36:33.333 --> 01:36:35.041
I'm just using my simple logic.

01:36:36.125 --> 01:36:37.875
We don't see each other that much, Ra.

01:36:38.625 --> 01:36:42.665
But every time we do,
I always demanded to be listened to.

01:36:42.666 --> 01:36:44.333
- Look--
- Let me finish.

01:36:46.791 --> 01:36:47.625
Okay.

01:36:48.375 --> 01:36:49.708
This time, I'll listen to you.

01:36:54.583 --> 01:36:56.041
What should I do?

01:37:07.625 --> 01:37:08.458
Hi, Va.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:25.458
<i>Find your father.</i>

01:37:26.166 --> 01:37:27.291
<i>Meet him.</i>

01:37:28.583 --> 01:37:31.541
<i>Be mad at him. Scream at him.</i>

01:37:32.333 --> 01:37:35.166
<i>Do whatever it takes
to heal those wounds inside you.</i>

01:37:58.541 --> 01:37:59.375
Okay.

01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:09.332
<i>This week, Reza Malik's attorney
will file a report against Ava Alessandra</i>

01:38:09.333 --> 01:38:14.999
<i>to the police over assault allegations
made by Ava towards Malik</i>

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.333
<i>during the filming of their latest movie.</i>

01:38:19.375 --> 01:38:21.249
<i>Everyone,</i>

01:38:21.250 --> 01:38:26.124
<i>we, as the legal counsel of Reza Malik,
would like to address</i>

01:38:26.125 --> 01:38:29.916
<i>how our client is in good faith
to consider reconciling with Ms. Ava.</i>

01:38:30.583 --> 01:38:33.957
<i>But we're finding it hard to see Ms. Ava.</i>

01:38:33.958 --> 01:38:36.083
<i>Settle everything with Reza Malik.</i>

01:38:36.750 --> 01:38:39.083
<i>You can't keep running away.</i>

01:38:40.708 --> 01:38:42.666
<i>Clean up all the mess</i>

01:38:43.250 --> 01:38:45.500
<i>before you plunge yourself
into another relationship.</i>

01:38:46.666 --> 01:38:48.666
<i>This is what I meant by "fair".</i>

01:38:49.708 --> 01:38:53.874
<i>For you and for anyone
that's coming into your life.</i>

01:38:53.875 --> 01:38:55.874
Did you think of Luna's feelings?

01:38:55.875 --> 01:38:57.540
This is her debut movie.

01:38:57.541 --> 01:38:59.957
Everything's ruined
just because you're being dramatic!

01:38:59.958 --> 01:39:01.540
Care for a drink?

01:39:01.541 --> 01:39:02.500
Coffee? Tea?

01:39:10.916 --> 01:39:14.041
I invited you here to talk about us.

01:39:15.458 --> 01:39:16.375
Can we try?

01:39:18.083 --> 01:39:20.000
Okay. What do you want?

01:39:23.166 --> 01:39:26.000
I think I've had enough of us.

01:39:31.375 --> 01:39:32.833
I think we should break up.

01:39:35.833 --> 01:39:36.666
No.

01:39:38.041 --> 01:39:38.916
We're not gonna break up.

01:39:47.083 --> 01:39:48.083
Mr. Raga.

01:39:49.541 --> 01:39:50.790
If you please,

01:39:50.791 --> 01:39:53.875
Miss Ava Alessandra
is waiting for you at the restaurant.

01:40:33.708 --> 01:40:35.207
<i>Miss Ava. Can you please give
your comments on the news?</i>

01:40:35.208 --> 01:40:40.457
Okay, settle down, everyone.
I will provide further details regarding

01:40:40.458 --> 01:40:43.665
the progress of this movie.

01:40:43.666 --> 01:40:46.957
So, the problem now is time...

01:40:46.958 --> 01:40:47.957
I will give...

01:40:47.958 --> 01:40:50.666
<i>I've invested a lot in this relationship.
I created you.</i>

01:40:51.250 --> 01:40:53.250
<i>Now, you're just gonna spit me out?</i>

01:40:54.333 --> 01:40:56.165
<i>I have nothing left for you anymore.</i>

01:40:56.166 --> 01:40:57.916
<i>That seems easy for you to say.</i>

01:40:58.916 --> 01:41:00.124
Tito, I know Ava is here.

01:41:00.125 --> 01:41:02.290
- I have to see her.
- Let's calm down a bit.

01:41:02.291 --> 01:41:05.582
<i>Ava actually asked me to come get you.</i>

01:41:05.583 --> 01:41:06.499
I NEED TO ESCAPE MALIK

01:41:06.500 --> 01:41:07.415
<i>Come.</i>

01:41:07.416 --> 01:41:08.332
AND TELL EVERYONE WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON

01:41:08.333 --> 01:41:10.041
What the hell, Ava?

01:41:10.708 --> 01:41:14.665
You're just gonna disappear without
an explanation after what happened?

01:41:14.666 --> 01:41:16.040
This is her debut movie.

01:41:16.041 --> 01:41:18.041
Everything's ruined
just because you're being dramatic!

01:41:20.375 --> 01:41:21.332
I think we should break up.

01:41:21.333 --> 01:41:22.375
No.

01:41:23.291 --> 01:41:24.458
We're not gonna break up.

01:41:25.041 --> 01:41:26.415
Have you gone mad?

01:41:26.416 --> 01:41:30.041
I've invested a lot in this relationship.
I created you.

01:41:31.208 --> 01:41:33.458
Now, you're just gonna spit me out?

01:41:34.625 --> 01:41:37.083
I have nothing left for you anymore.

01:41:37.583 --> 01:41:39.415
That seems easy for you to say.
Say it again.

01:41:39.416 --> 01:41:40.790
- Say it.
- It hurts.

01:41:40.791 --> 01:41:42.124
Say it.

01:41:42.125 --> 01:41:44.458
I've had enough of what
you've done to me all this time.

01:41:46.333 --> 01:41:48.165
You always manage
to push me into a corner, Va.

01:41:48.166 --> 01:41:49.125
It's you.

01:41:51.541 --> 01:41:54.666
Let me go... or I'll scream!

01:42:03.625 --> 01:42:04.708
Go ahead. Scream.

01:42:06.083 --> 01:42:06.958
Go on.

01:42:08.833 --> 01:42:10.833
You have no proof.

01:42:11.541 --> 01:42:14.375
Everyone on set knows what you did to me.

01:42:16.083 --> 01:42:17.041
Did you forget?

01:42:20.250 --> 01:42:21.125
Did you?

01:42:25.125 --> 01:42:25.958
All right.

01:42:26.666 --> 01:42:29.165
Call Mr. Ranbir and Luna.

01:42:29.166 --> 01:42:31.500
Set up a meeting with them.

01:42:32.916 --> 01:42:36.041
Tell them that you're committed
to finish the filming.

01:42:36.791 --> 01:42:37.625
All right?

01:42:38.375 --> 01:42:40.416
Okay? Or else,

01:42:41.125 --> 01:42:43.250
I'll file a report to the police tomorrow.

01:42:43.958 --> 01:42:45.207
Got it?

01:42:45.208 --> 01:42:46.375
Pack your bags.

01:42:47.666 --> 01:42:48.583
I'll be waiting.

01:43:03.958 --> 01:43:04.790
Okay, I said...

01:43:04.791 --> 01:43:06.749
- What do you say about this video, sir?
- Be patient...

01:43:06.750 --> 01:43:08.207
Yes, sir. What do you say?

01:43:08.208 --> 01:43:11.207
I'll take full responsibility
for all the losses I’ve caused you.

01:43:11.208 --> 01:43:13.916
We can continue this movie
with another cast.

01:43:17.041 --> 01:43:19.124
Lun, I'm so sorry that
your first movie ended up like this.

01:43:19.125 --> 01:43:20.416
I understand.

01:43:21.166 --> 01:43:22.291
It's okay.

01:43:26.458 --> 01:43:28.166
- Malik!
- Malik!

01:44:07.833 --> 01:44:10.249
Thank you so much, Dahlia.

01:44:10.250 --> 01:44:11.999
You're welcome.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:13.749
Why are you thanking me?

01:44:13.750 --> 01:44:16.583
All I did was scold you all the time.

01:44:21.208 --> 01:44:22.875
Thank you for that.

01:44:24.083 --> 01:44:26.333
It reminds me of what it felt like
to be scolded.

01:44:38.125 --> 01:44:40.958
Here? You can't find
another place to meet?

01:44:41.833 --> 01:44:44.000
Everyone's too scared
to scold a penthouse guest.

01:44:44.500 --> 01:44:45.625
You're such a pain!

01:44:59.833 --> 01:45:02.166
I think I'm gonna miss these moments.

01:45:05.833 --> 01:45:08.458
Getting inside the service area
with a hotel staff.

01:45:09.791 --> 01:45:11.833
Who turned out to be in disguise.

01:45:17.208 --> 01:45:19.041
I don't think being "in disguise"
is the right term.

01:45:21.750 --> 01:45:22.875
What, then?

01:45:25.708 --> 01:45:26.791
Incognito?

01:45:47.125 --> 01:45:47.958
Va.

01:45:49.958 --> 01:45:51.375
I'm flying home tomorrow.

01:45:52.291 --> 01:45:55.500
I don't want to miss the chance
to say this to you.

01:46:00.708 --> 01:46:02.041
Can we start over?

01:46:35.791 --> 01:46:37.458
I want to know more about you.

01:46:41.791 --> 01:46:42.833
As Ava.

01:47:01.041 --> 01:47:01.875
Well...

01:47:07.041 --> 01:47:09.832
We might be worlds apart,

01:47:09.833 --> 01:47:12.666
but I'll try to manage.

01:47:14.458 --> 01:47:19.124
Maybe I could find
other opportunities in Jakarta,

01:47:19.125 --> 01:47:20.666
or maybe we could

01:47:22.416 --> 01:47:25.165
try a long distance relationship

01:47:25.166 --> 01:47:28.500
while trying to see
if there's a real connection?

01:48:02.375 --> 01:48:03.208
Well...

01:48:06.958 --> 01:48:08.541
Let's give it a try.

01:48:18.083 --> 01:48:18.916
Ava.

01:48:20.916 --> 01:48:22.833
Ava Alessandra.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:28.208
Raga Assad.

01:48:30.416 --> 01:48:32.625
- Hi, Raga.
- Hi.

01:49:39.375 --> 01:49:40.333
Good evening.

01:49:52.125 --> 01:49:54.625
Your father is waiting over there.

01:49:57.041 --> 01:49:58.875
- Thanks, Tito.
- Ava.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:02.333
If anything happens,

01:50:03.333 --> 01:50:06.416
you know I'm right here.

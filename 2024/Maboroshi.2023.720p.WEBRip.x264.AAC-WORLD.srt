3
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:50,759
The director is glaring, so let's move on.

4
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:53,386
This one is about
high school entrance exams.

5
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,346
From our listener, "Sleeping Lamb."

6
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,973
"DJ Naoto, good evening."

7
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:57,974
Good evening.

8
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,602
"I hate studying for entrance exams."

9
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:02,896
"I feel like dying."

10
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:05,857
Uh-oh. That's not good.

11
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,568
"It's not that I hate studying, it's…"

12
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,487
Masamune, do you know this one?

13
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,738
Hm? Not a clue.

14
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:14,074
Happy Turn's so good!

15
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,367
Hey, Senba, let me see that.

16
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,828
Hey, you've got powder on your fingers!

17
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,247
How tragic that you do not know happiness.

18
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,542
-I don't care about your happiness.
-Sorry, I know it doesn't matter…

19
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:28,797
If they can admit that it doesn't matter,
why'd they bother sending it to the radio?

20
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,090
Happy Turn!

21
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,636
Why did you fart under the blanket?!

22
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,097
-It stinks like the end of the world!
-You're rotten!

23
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,934
-My brain is rotten.
-It smells like pickles.

24
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,227
Oh, geez…

25
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,066
What is that?

26
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,789
The steel factory…

27
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:31,442
"There's nothing I want to do
and I don't care about the future."

28
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,529
"So why do I have to try so hard?"

29
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:37,198
"It feels like it's always dark
no matter how far I go."

30
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,868
At that moment, we knew.

31
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,205
Even without anyone explaining it to us.

32
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,791
For some reason, we knew.

33
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,210
That this place

34
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:52,547
was different from where we were before.

35
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:57,010
"If I do that, I think I can become
a better version of myself."

36
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,595
"If I get into high school…"

37
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,305
Masamune, are you going?

38
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,225
Hurry up, Masamune!

39
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:07,812
"I'll read one book a week
and even help my parents sometimes."

40
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,607
"So please let me pass the exams."

41
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,067
"Please, god!"

42
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,281
The sky is shattered!

43
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,158
Hey, that's…!

44
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:23,077
There's smoke
coming from the steel factory.

45
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,455
Is that really smoke?

46
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,357
The smoke is biting onto them…

47
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,193
The cracks…

48
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,612
are closing.

49
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:31,980
MABOROSHI

50
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,985
Ready, go!

51
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:49,080
Masamune Kikuiri, age 14.

52
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:51,791
He's out. He's unconscious.

53
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:54,252
Masamune, hey, hey, hey!

54
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,379
He made such a weird sound.

55
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,551
Masamune, how was it?

56
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,767
I saw it.

57
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:13,021
Masamune Kikuiri has long hair.

58
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,277
Stop it!

59
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,779
Sasakura, stop getting horny
just like that.

60
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:25,950
I can't help it,
Masamune looks like a girl from behind.

61
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,244
You're the one who's chubby and has boobs.

62
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,913
Oh, erotic!

63
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,418
I don't really mind
people saying I look like a girl.

64
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,046
It doesn't mean that I like boys.

65
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,339
I like girls,

66
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:42,133
but it's not like there's a girl I like.

67
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,051
But still…

68
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,761
Masamune, take a look.

69
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,764
It's Mutsumi Sagami.

70
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,140
I'm sorry!

71
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:53,144
Oh, they're just amazing.

72
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,063
The backs of their knees…

73
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,440
are so erotic.

74
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,108
That's a little too niche.

75
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,611
Many thanks for the compliment.

76
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,280
Stop talking like an old geezer.

77
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:06,449
She's an old bag too.

78
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:10,203
Masamune Kikuiri hates Mutsumi Sagami.

79
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:13,456
Those who haven't turned in
their Self-Monitoring Form,

80
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,125
make sure to finish it before the weekend.

81
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,628
Kikuiri, I'm talking about you.

82
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,926
But it's so boring.

83
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,845
Writing the same thing
over and over to avoid change.

84
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,765
Just write something and get it over with.

85
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,433
They don't read it anyway.

86
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,684
That's not true.

87
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:38,106
They got mad at me for
changing my dreams for the future.

88
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,440
What did you write?

89
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,983
"Mutsumi Sagami's boy toy!"

90
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,235
Of course.

91
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,570
What do you see in her? She's so plain.

92
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:48,449
I just love how she seems
quick to give in to pushy men.

93
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,827
Here's a push! And again!

94
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,411
That hurts!

95
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,789
-Another push!
-I said that hurts!

96
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:57,500
For some reason, whenever we hung out

97
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:03,047
we went out of our way to do things
that were difficult or painful.

98
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,884
-Want to go again?
-What?

99
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,970
Give me a break.

100
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:15,726
Again…

101
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,687
Masamune, hurry up.

102
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,038
I'm home.

103
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,208
Masamune, food's almost ready.

104
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:40,960
Hey. Welcome home.

105
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,254
Uncle, you came over?

106
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:45,131
Here's some ginger pork.

107
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:48,050
It doesn't have ginger in it though.
It's just garlic pork.

108
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,721
It looks the same.
It's close enough to the real thing.

109
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,307
Yeah, you got that right.

110
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,978
Tokimune, if you're coming over
you have to let me know in advance.

111
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,731
I only made two cups of rice.

112
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,609
It's alright,
I'm good as long as I have this.

113
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,321
I want to know everything!

114
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,407
"Want to know everything"?

115
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,909
That's right!

116
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,746
Grandpa, you left the water running
in the garden again.

117
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,539
Hmm.

118
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:19,749
Oh, geez!

119
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,251
All you men in this family…

120
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,213
SELF-MONITORING FORM

121
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:28,382
Masamune Kikuiri is…

122
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:46,526
Aren't you supposed to abstain
from alcohol and cigarettes?

123
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,696
That's unacceptable for
someone who works under gods.

124
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,157
The steel factory is
running on its own now.

125
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,452
All we do now is pretend to work.

126
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,376
We have a morning assembly
and then we do some checkups.

127
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:08,506
Maybe check where the smoke is going.
That's about it.

128
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,300
Were you drawing just now?

129
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,846
Want to draw illustrations
for the factory's monthly report?

130
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:22,061
No thanks. I'd feel awkward
if you go out of your way like that.

131
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:24,355
Come on, a child shouldn't worry about--

132
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,898
But I'm not a child.

133
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,776
Though I'll never be an adult.

134
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,535
That's the second time today…

135
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,954
It's getting more frequent.

136
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,840
That's horrible! Poor Sonobe!

137
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,217
-What happened?
-They were gone this morning.

138
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,427
Huh?

139
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,721
It was one of the boys, wasn't it?

140
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,973
-Hell no.
-Hey!

141
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:01,684
Don't put your butt on Hara's desk!

142
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,394
-What?
-That's horrible.

143
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:06,063
-Cheer up, Sonobe.
-I'll infuse my fart into it.

144
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,815
-You're the worst!
-You're the worst!

145
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,827
Sorry, you go ahead.

146
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,330
I knew it…

147
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,498
Pervert.

148
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,334
Give those back.

149
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,002
They're mine.

150
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,296
MUTSUMI SAGAMI

151
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:14,840
Thank goodness!

152
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,469
These are too big to walk in.

153
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:24,975
YUKO SONOBE

154
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,435
Sonobe?

155
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,895
Sonobe started it.

156
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,857
Sonobe stole my indoor shoes first.

157
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:35,528
And since my mine were gone,
I put on hers.

158
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,863
Huh? I don't understand.

159
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,450
So you guys take each other's shoes
back and forth?

160
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:46,080
It's like that passing-out game
that you guys play.

161
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:52,044
It's all out of boredom, isn't it?

162
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:57,133
Do you want me to
show you something that will…

163
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,718
blow away the boredom?

164
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:11,105
In this town,
there are signs of it everywhere.

165
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,900
Signs that
those without lives are breathing.

166
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,819
AUTO SNACK MIFUSE

167
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,532
Hey, wait up!

168
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,079
We can't go anywhere.

169
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:29,999
It all started…

170
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,378
on that night with that explosion.

171
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:38,257
The survey results are now available.

172
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:43,012
The tunnel is now impassable
due to the landslide.

173
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,515
And we cannot leave by sea
due to the ocean current.

174
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:51,061
Regarding this matter,
we'd like to hear from Mamoru Sagami,

175
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,272
an employee at Mifuse Steel Factory

176
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:58,736
who is from Mifuse Shrine's
hereditary Shinto priesthood.

177
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,284
Mr. Mayor, th-thank you…

178
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,870
Huh? Isn't that Mutsumi Sagami's dad?

179
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:08,787
What?

180
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,707
Mr. Akimune, I'm going up there now.

181
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,917
Yes, please do.

182
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,502
Mr. Sagami, please hurry.

183
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,010
Umm…

184
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:26,138
S-Since the age of
the Industrial Revolution,

185
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,140
we, the people of Mifuse,

186
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:32,353
h-have lived relying on the blessings of
the metals we obtained from Mt. Kanzari.

187
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:35,773
However, please consider this.

188
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:39,568
Mifuse Shrine
worships the mountain itself.

189
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:43,113
In other words, this town has been
chiseling at the god all this time.

190
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:46,033
That's right, I believe we are now…

191
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,953
being presented with divine punishment!

192
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,080
-I don't understand.
-We're getting a present?

193
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,373
Who is this?

194
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:53,541
Don't you know?

195
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,794
Sagami's only son
is famous for being eccentric.

196
00:13:56,877 --> 00:14:00,297
How blissful ignorance truly is!

197
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:07,763
What you see there now
is no longer the same steel factory!

198
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,267
In the wake of the explosion,
it has changed!

199
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:15,312
It has changed into a machine of the gods,
a Sacred Machine!

200
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:19,441
And this Sacred Machine
has trapped us in Mifuse!

201
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,288
This is crazy!

202
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,623
What will we do if the grownups catch us?

203
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,511
Hey, do you hear a voice?

204
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:59,607
It wasn’t long after the speech by
Sagami’s dad that we would come to know…

205
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:06,530
We weren't just trapped in this place.

206
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:12,745
We had also been separated from
the seasons by this Sacred Machine.

207
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,046
DANGER

208
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,257
Masamune Kikuiri.

209
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,552
In a never-ending winter at 14 years old.

210
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,405
THE 5TH BLAST FURNACE

211
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:06,006
I was guided by the hand
of the person I hate, Mutsumi Sagami.

212
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,866
Hey, stop…

213
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,627
Guided to a girl in captivity.

214
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,436
Hey, wait a second!

215
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,781
Ugh, it stinks.

216
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,159
It’s a shocking stench, isn’t it?

217
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,911
But you weren't as surprised
as I thought you'd be.

218
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,831
I was too stunned to react.

219
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,709
So what's with that girl?

220
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,210
She kinda looks like you.

221
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,546
Stop it. That’s gross.

222
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:28,714
Then what is she?

223
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,966
What does she look like?

224
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,011
A monkey? A gorilla? Or a chimpanzee?

225
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,306
If I had to pick, I guess a wolf.

226
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,726
Is that good?

227
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:41,643
Yeah.

228
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,522
Anyway, they say
we can't let that girl outside.

229
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:48,817
So they put me in charge
of taking care of her.

230
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,903
Oh, did your dad put you up to this?

231
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:55,324
But with how big she is,
it's hard to get her to take a bath.

232
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:02,915
I wanted the help of a boy,
but that also comes with its own problems.

233
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:05,667
So I brought you here
because you're like a girl.

234
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,710
Huh?

235
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,379
You even liked it
when Sasakura felt up your chest.

236
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,715
I didn't like it!

237
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,008
Screw you!

238
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,845
It really doesn't suit you
when you talk all tough like that.

239
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,681
I'm going home!

240
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:27,022
Come by on Mondays, Wednesdays,
and Fridays, Masamune.

241
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,774
We're on a first-name basis?

242
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:31,235
You can call me Mutsumi too.

243
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,361
Huh?

244
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:36,615
Do you know what characters
are used to write my name?

245
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,618
"Mu" meaning "six"
and "tsumi" meaning "sins."

246
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,036
Don't make up dumb lies.

247
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:45,415
It was something like
"harmonious" and "reality."

248
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:50,504
Hmm, so you are interested in me.

249
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,969
A wolf.

250
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:59,930
The girl is not the wolf, I am.

251
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,517
The wolf girl who’s full of lies.

252
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,163
Masamune, come get your grandpa.

253
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,874
The disaster prevention meeting
starts at 8 o'clock!

254
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,466
Masamune?!

255
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,927
Yeah! Just wait a second!

256
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:45,976
Get in.

257
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,980
Masamune Kikuiri has a driver's license.

258
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:55,652
I can’t believe the only adult right
I have is being able to drive a car.

259
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:59,531
You can't do anything
in the countryside without a car.

260
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,160
But it's not like
we can do anything with it now.

261
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,079
My name is Soji Kikuiri.

262
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,457
I'm 74 years old.

263
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,834
I have no wife. I have no hobbies.

264
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,419
I do have back pain.

265
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,923
You can stay seated.

266
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:19,968
Umm… Hitoshi Tachibana.

267
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:24,181
-I'm 80… No, was it 90?
-Has he lost it?

268
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,099
No, that's how he's always been.

269
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,392
Listen.

270
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,603
When the world returns
to its original form

271
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:32,898
and you've changed from
your previous selves, there may be issues.

272
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:37,444
This is why we check to see if you have
changed from your previous selves.

273
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:41,406
If you do find that you've changed
even the slightest, we must correct it.

274
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,743
Masamune, do you listen to the radio?

275
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:49,623
No, it's always the same show,
and the guy that writes in is annoying.

276
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:53,669
You know how the DJ doesn’t reply
and puts on a song instead?

277
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:58,173
I kept listening to it over and over,
wondering what it meant.

278
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,344
And I found myself
wanting to become a DJ too.

279
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:06,765
I thought you preferred jobs
where you could be in the background.

280
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,100
Yeah.

281
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:12,187
I guess if none of this had happened,
I wouldn't have ever wanted to do it.

282
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,148
We're not allowed to change,

283
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:19,152
so on my Self-Monitoring Form,
I say I'll take over the family business.

284
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,165
That's the wife of Mr. Yamazaki.

285
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,502
She was so happy
she had finally gotten pregnant.

286
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,922
But all this happened
before the baby was born.

287
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,216
While the baby's still in her womb.

288
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:45,095
I'm sure she'll see her baby
when we all get out of here.

289
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,014
Yeah.

290
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:01,486
"Philosophical Secret Technique,
Energeia"? That's so bad.

291
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:05,532
Uncle even came to pick you up.
How long are you going to skip work?

292
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:09,286
You know, Energeia is a behavior
unique to humans.

293
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,497
It's when you disregard
how much time an action takes

294
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:15,959
and the action and purpose are
aligned to simply live in the moment.

295
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,420
You can't just keep running away.

296
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:22,007
I've always run away.

297
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:26,428
Back in the day,
I ran from university and dropped out.

298
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,974
I also ran away from your mom,
but she followed me to Mifuse.

299
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,809
Then we had you.

300
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,603
You make it sound bad.

301
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,147
I don't regret that.

302
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:41,860
It's been easy being with your mom
and you're an interesting guy, Masamune.

303
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:43,570
But…

304
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:46,073
it's impossible now.

305
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,659
I can't run away anymore.

306
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,580
Remember what that Sagami guy said?

307
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,582
If the anger of
the Sacred Machine subsides,

308
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,584
the world might go back to normal.

309
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,089
For the first time in a while…

310
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,634
my dad went to work the night shift.

311
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:09,221
And he never came home after that.

312
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,597
FAMILY: MOTHER, GRANDFATHER

313
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:15,852
SAFETY FIRST

314
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,773
Man, such a bummer.

315
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:23,193
It's literally hell
working under that guy.

316
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:27,489
He even said he knows
about the gods of Mifuse the most.

317
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:30,742
He used to be just some weird loser.

318
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,746
Hey, you're being summoned, Kikuiri.

319
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,082
Hey, over there!

320
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:41,545
THE 5TH BLAST FURNACE

321
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:54,641
5TH FURNACE

322
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,986
You want to eat this?

323
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:07,154
Eat!

324
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:19,833
So you can speak, huh?

325
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:23,545
Spea… Speak?

326
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,755
Hey, who are you?

327
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,174
Hm?

328
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,884
You look like Mutsumi Sagami.

329
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,220
Are you guys twins?

330
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,680
Mitsumi?

331
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,559
The girl who always comes
to look after you.

332
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:40,520
Girl! Tsumi!

333
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,189
Mitsumi!

334
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:46,067
Mitsumi!

335
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,652
Do you want a name too?

336
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,739
THE 5TH BLAST FURNACE

337
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,158
Like Itsumi?

338
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:55,577
Mitsu?

339
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,578
Mitsumi!

340
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,455
No, not that.

341
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,540
Itsumi!

342
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,375
I'm Masamune.

343
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,252
Masamine! Girl!

344
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,962
I'm a boy!

345
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:09,049
A boy!

346
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,011
Girl!

347
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,891
Hey, Itsumi!

348
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:19,643
Can I call her that?

349
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,284
A train?

350
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:39,829
Hey, Mitsumi!

351
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:42,624
Is this your playground?

352
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,420
Careful!

353
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:23,540
Hey! Where are you?

354
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:25,959
Hello?

355
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:28,003
We're on patrol.

356
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,255
Where did you go?

357
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:34,426
Wow, you've gotten so big again!

358
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:37,721
Look how she's grown!

359
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:41,683
Just look at her, almost complete.
A complete woman!

360
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,977
What? Is Mutsumi not here?

361
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,982
You can't come any closer.

362
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:51,401
It’ll be a problem
if you fall in love with me.

363
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:54,738
I guess Mutsumi has been
taking good care of you.

364
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:57,532
Mr. Sagami, can't we look for another way

365
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,493
instead of keeping her locked up here?

366
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:01,661
What?!

367
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:05,790
The Sacred Machine went through a lot
to call her here.

368
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,209
The girl destined to be
a woman of the gods!

369
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,253
As long as we have this girl,

370
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:13,590
we might one day be forgiven
by the Sacred Machine!

371
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:16,634
-And yet!
-What would my late brother think?

372
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,933
Mr. Akimune lost his ability
to make the correct decisions.

373
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:26,603
Such a waste,
even after I made him my right-hand man.

374
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:27,520
Mr. Sagami--

375
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:28,646
In this world…

376
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:32,275
you should do as I say.

377
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:36,488
Don't disappoint me, Tokimune.

378
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:39,991
What was that about?

379
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,632
Oh. Isn't this egg coffee? How nostalgic.

380
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,509
I had this often when I was a student.

381
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,262
Tastes great!

382
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:04,766
Did you and my mom
go to the same university?

383
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:08,436
Yeah, when Misato came to visit my dorm,
she met my brother.

384
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:12,565
I had unknowingly become Cupid.

385
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:16,528
Uncle, you working in
the 5th Blast Furnace…

386
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:17,487
Hm?

387
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,782
Are you going after my mom?

388
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:31,126
Is there anyone
who can take this to Sagami's house?

389
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,044
I'll go.

390
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,213
Oh, thanks Sonobe.

391
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,882
Should I go with you?

392
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,301
I don't have anything to do today.

393
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,511
No thanks.

394
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:42,595
Huh?

395
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:49,602
Did you know that unpopular girls
tend to hang out with the cute girls?

396
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,313
Hoping they can get some scraps.

397
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,023
He keeps barking and barking.

398
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:01,990
I brought my old books.

399
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:05,160
Spooky, spooky ghosts!

400
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,038
Ghosts…

401
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,001
SLEEPY SLEEPY GHOST

402
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:17,255
Are you cold?

403
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:20,008
You're so weird.

404
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:20,925
Here.

405
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,136
Oh, this is hand-knit.

406
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,055
Mitsumi gave to me!

407
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:28,099
No wonder I thought it looked weird.

408
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:37,567
I thought you hated Mutsumi Sagami.

409
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,779
You don't really talk when she's around.

410
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:45,617
Hey…

411
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:48,244
Don't you ever want to get out of here?

412
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,749
Though I guess even if you left…

413
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,169
you couldn't get much farther.

414
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,139
Sonobe?

415
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,186
Why are you here?

416
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,231
She wasn't home. She skipped class.

417
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,190
Huh?

418
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:18,942
That's Mutsumi's house.

419
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,486
Huh? Why?

420
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,364
The Sagami house is at Mifuse Shrine.

421
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:27,200
Mutsumi is a stepchild.

422
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:28,284
What?

423
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:31,788
Her mother died a little before
the world changed.

424
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,540
She's living by herself now.

425
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,750
Sonobe, you--

426
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,461
The Sagami family wanted an heir.

427
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:41,881
But that old man has no interest in women.

428
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:46,010
So the Sagami family chose my mom,
who already came with a child.

429
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:51,391
But in this world,
there's no longer a need for an heir.

430
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:52,892
So I was kicked out.

431
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,562
That's horrible, Mutsumi…

432
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:56,479
"Mutsumi"?

433
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:57,605
Huh?

434
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,191
You called her by her first name…

435
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,694
So you two really are a thing?

436
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:05,071
What do you mean?

437
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:07,407
Aw…

438
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,075
What did I even do wrong?

439
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:11,870
If you have a car, give her a ride.

440
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,955
It's your fault after all.

441
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,625
CEDAR INCENSE

442
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,543
Hey.

443
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:22,922
Y-You and the steel factory woman
are related, right?

444
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:24,966
We aren't related.

445
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:27,886
Liar.

446
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,306
It's not that I hate her.

447
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:38,062
It's just that whenever I'm with her…

448
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,149
I feel so anxious.

449
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,655
What?! A test of courage?

450
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,366
That's right,
I heard they haunt that place.

451
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,035
The Kanzari Tunnel.

452
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:56,164
The ghosts of the workers
who were killed by the smoke monsters.

453
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,498
Huh?

454
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,251
But if we go to the tunnel,
the adults will be angry.

455
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,669
We just won't get caught.

456
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:05,214
It sounds fun,
but hanging out with boys at night?

457
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,716
Everyone's going to tease us.

458
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,052
Whatever. I don't care if you come.

459
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:09,969
Huh?!

460
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,930
-Come on, man.
-I didn't mean it!

461
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:15,475
-The devil in me just took over.
-That's no excuse!

462
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,226
You are the real devil!

463
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,980
-Nitta, help me out with your powers.
-I… I think I'll go.

464
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:24,025
No way, Sonobe! Why?!

465
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:26,319
I thought you didn't like
this kind of thing.

466
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:28,029
If Sonobe's going, I will too.

467
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,280
Seriously?!

468
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:30,782
Now there's two girls.

469
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:31,950
Yay!

470
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,535
What? Yasumi?

471
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,162
Are you serious?

472
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,801
-It's perfectly creepy.
-I haven't been to the station in forever.

473
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:52,971
The tunnel is a dead end now
from the landslide.

474
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:56,641
Let's write something on the wall
once we get pretty far in.

475
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:59,227
Write something? That's too vague.

476
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,562
Something that proves we were there.

477
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,525
Alright, the first pair!

478
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:06,442
What?

479
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,028
Who's next?

480
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,869
It's wet here.

481
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:27,964
Should we do it here?

482
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,716
I can keep going.

483
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,426
But even if we keep going…

484
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,262
Okay, I'll write first.

485
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:58,953
Done.

486
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,371
YUKO / MASAMUNE

487
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,873
Who's Yuko?

488
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:03,791
Me.

489
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,711
You can't just write that.

490
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,964
Do you hate me?

491
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,175
Well, why do you--

492
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:15,011
I think I like you…

493
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:16,137
Why though?

494
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:21,768
I think I like you. You even let me sit
in the passenger seat the other night.

495
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:25,271
Wait, I don't think that's how
liking someone works.

496
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:27,523
So you do like Mutsumi…

497
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,117
Guys?

498
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:41,329
Um, Sasakura said that
he heard a weird sound.

499
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:44,123
Y-Yeah! We were worried
so we came to find you.

500
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,041
Huh?

501
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:47,043
Hey, what's this?

502
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:48,211
No, it's…

503
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:50,171
-A couple's umbrella?
-It's not!

504
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:53,132
Huh? You don't have to hide it.

505
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,550
Idiot! Stop it!

506
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,469
Why?

507
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,931
-Sonobe!
-Wait, Sonobe!

508
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,360
Sonobe!

509
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,278
The sky!

510
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,239
It's just like that day!

511
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,616
-Mutsumi.
-Huh?

512
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:22,912
We've played our games
to escape the boredom, right?

513
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:27,458
Games to make ourselves think
that we don't want to run away.

514
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,545
Right now, I…

515
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:34,715
I'm so embarrassed, I want to run away.

516
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,093
My feelings for someone…

517
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,929
have become a spectacle.

518
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:42,723
Huh?

519
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:47,103
Hey, that’s…

520
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:55,027
The smoke…

521
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,704
It looks like a wolf!

522
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,737
Get down, Sonobe!

523
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,155
Hey!

524
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:40,406
Sonobe!

525
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,581
-No way.
-This is crazy!

526
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,210
-What should we do?
-I don’t know.

527
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:36,712
What…

528
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:38,798
Sonobe…

529
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,299
What's the meaning of this?

530
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:43,135
Everyone, please don't panic
and calm down.

531
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,720
How can we be calm?!

532
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:48,224
They're saying she was eaten
by a wolf made of smoke.

533
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:49,976
Somebody explain!

534
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,894
Are you going to say
we're being punished--

535
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,646
Chomp!

536
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,857
Was she really eaten?

537
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:00,069
By a wolf with its mouth open like this?

538
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,697
I'm not sure.

539
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,241
It… kinda looked like

540
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:09,036
she disappeared as soon as she got hit.

541
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:09,996
That's it!

542
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:15,126
I'm sure you've all seen this before.

543
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:21,924
The smoke from the steel factory flies
right into the cracks throughout the sky.

544
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:28,055
That is the smoke wolf
created by the Sacred Machine.

545
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,308
The Sacred Wolf!

546
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,729
The Sacred… Wolf.

547
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:37,606
The Sacred Machine
tries to close all cracks in this world.

548
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:41,277
If you want to stay alive,
don't let your emotions overpower you.

549
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:45,865
There must have been something
that caused a crack in her soul.

550
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,076
Relax!

551
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:53,080
We all share a common destiny.

552
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:57,168
We all experience
the same pain in the same world.

553
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:04,550
That is why we must not even dream
of escaping this world.

554
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:09,680
Where's Masamune?

555
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,812
A large amount of smoke has appeared.

556
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:21,901
Please return to your homes immediately
and make sure your doors are shut.

557
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:27,448
Until we are able to confirm safety,
please avoid traveling outside…

558
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,539
What are you doing, Masamune?

559
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:37,750
Uncle…

560
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,380
Hurry up and come home.

561
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,590
All of your friends went home.

562
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:45,800
I don't want to!

563
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:51,222
Why do we have to stay locked up at home?

564
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,933
We're already locked up in Mifuse.

565
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,017
Calm down, Masamune.

566
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:55,935
No.

567
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:57,812
I don't want to be here.

568
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:01,565
I want to go to a city
with a big bookstore and a theater!

569
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:06,320
And I want to study a lot
and see a bunch of things.

570
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,280
I want to be an illustrator.

571
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,573
It's okay.

572
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,325
What's okay about this?!

573
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,494
I can't trust you, Uncle!

574
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,538
You knew all about Itsumi!

575
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,623
Itsumi?

576
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:21,544
Why? Dad knew about her too, right?

577
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:26,465
You guys locked Itsumi in that place
and you were both okay with it?!

578
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:28,968
Why won't you answer me?

579
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,928
Why won't you say anything?!

580
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:32,930
That child…

581
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,851
She shouldn't be here.

582
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,104
That's enough. Let's go.

583
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,567
I'll protect you on my brother's behalf.

584
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,026
You and…

585
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:47,987
everyone.

586
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:52,158
I didn't ask you to do that.

587
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,535
SHE SAID SHE LIKED ME

588
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,454
Masamune Kikuiri

589
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:59,999
was told by a girl that she liked him
for the first time.

590
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,546
SONOBE DISAPPEARED

591
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:06,714
IT WAS MY FAULT

592
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:07,882
IT’S ALL BECAUSE

593
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:10,634
I LIKE MUTSUMI SAGAMI

594
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,254
Did I wake you up? Sorry.

595
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:01,519
You smell, but somehow I feel at ease.

596
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:05,856
Do you understand?

597
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:08,025
The feeling of love?

598
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:09,360
Love?

599
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:10,945
I don't understand.

600
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,615
Sonobe said being in the passenger seat
made her fall in love.

601
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,201
I know it's not like that.

602
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,661
I know that much.

603
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:23,207
But, I'm also strange.

604
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:29,213
My feeling of love is so similar to hate.

605
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:33,884
It hurts and it just doesn't feel right.

606
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:39,807
Huh?

607
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,560
Why am I…

608
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:44,895
Masamine…

609
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:46,480
I'm sorry.

610
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:49,984
I…

611
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:55,739
Masamine.

612
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,116
Itsumi.

613
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:06,083
My heart wasn't pounding.

614
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:10,129
It just felt warm and nostalgic.

615
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:12,381
Love really is so warm.

616
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:15,092
But Sonobe didn't know.

617
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,553
She doesn't know either.

618
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:25,352
What are you doing?

619
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,105
What are you doing?!

620
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:31,650
I guess you're male after all!

621
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:33,068
Wait…

622
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:35,487
What's "Itsumi"?! Her name?!

623
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:38,407
That's right!

624
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:42,620
I gave her that name
because she has one less sin than you!

625
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:46,457
Itsumi, come here.

626
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:49,460
I'll get you out of here.

627
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:51,295
Out of here?

628
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:53,756
I'll show you so many things!

629
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:59,428
Why are you crying?

630
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:03,307
What are you doing there?!

631
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:04,725
Masamune!

632
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,435
Itsumi, run!

633
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:08,896
Mutsumi, I'm sorry.

634
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:11,440
-Come with me!
-Wait there! Hey!

635
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:15,069
You dare bare your fangs at the gods?!
You are a sinner!

636
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,407
It’s a huge platform.

637
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:28,874
Why is there a train back at the furnace
when this platform is here?

638
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:32,544
That's because…

639
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:50,187
Itsumi…

640
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:30,519
What is this?

641
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,980
On the other side of the cracks…

642
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:34,898
is a different world.

643
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:37,359
Itsumi!

644
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:47,578
Itsumi, stop! It's dangerous!

645
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:49,204
Look!

646
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:55,043
Look! Look!

647
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:58,046
Masamune, where are you?!

648
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,715
Where is the woman of the gods?

649
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:02,092
-If I don't get her back, the world--
-No way!

650
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,135
You're…

651
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,512
Don't move, Masamune!

652
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,681
Why can't I move?!

653
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:08,807
Look!

654
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:13,312
They dare resist the gods?

655
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,606
I want to see too!

656
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:18,066
I want to see so many more things!

657
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:20,527
Look more! More!

658
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:23,113
Just maybe that girl can…

659
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:30,037
No… No!

660
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:34,124
You want to see more, right? Much more!

661
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,793
More! More!

662
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,879
More! More!

663
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:43,717
More!

664
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:03,195
Itsumi, this is…

665
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:06,698
No…

666
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:32,933
Would you look at that?

667
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,978
Even that girl cannot leave
through the cracks.

668
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:37,938
She had me worried.

669
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,106
Oh, it's coming out!

670
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:40,983
Sacred Wolf!

671
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:45,153
Close the cracks of this world!

672
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:50,325
Uncle!

673
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:52,494
The place on the other side of the light.

674
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:54,830
-It's reality.
-Hey, shh!

675
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:58,750
H-Hey, Tokimune,
that's supposed to be a secret.

676
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,669
We can't hide it anymore.

677
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:05,674
We've been locked in Mifuse as punishment.

678
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:09,303
But someday,
we will be able to leave this place.

679
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,220
That was…

680
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:13,724
a lie we told you all
so you wouldn't lose hope.

681
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:20,731
It may have been a lie,
but it was a very small one.

682
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:22,482
To be precise, this world

683
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:26,445
is an anti-reality dimension
created by the Sacred Machine.

684
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:28,488
So it's not really a big difference--

685
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,324
It's a huge difference!

686
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:34,369
If this isn't reality then what are we?

687
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,288
Are we dead?

688
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:37,789
Are we made up?

689
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:39,750
Like, we're immaterial?

690
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:43,170
So Mifuse and all of us here are fake?
Sounds good to me.

691
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:44,546
Why did you keep quiet?!

692
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:47,924
-Explain everything!
-So we can't ever leave Mifuse?

693
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:54,097
Why does it matter
if this world is not reality?

694
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:59,061
As long as you don't get a crack
in your soul, it doesn’t matter at all!

695
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:02,939
Are we fake? Nay!
We are a fleeting illusion!

696
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:06,610
That is why our lives
can continue for eternity!

697
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:09,154
I don't need your eternity!

698
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:10,572
Huh?

699
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:14,284
I don't want to be stuck
in this town forever.

700
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,411
We can't ever grow up.

701
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,413
I can't take it!

702
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:26,755
Okay, I think we're done
listening to the boy's opinion.

703
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:31,051
The eternal existence of this world
is of utmost importance!

704
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:34,638
To accomplish this, that girl must be
returned to the Sacred Machine!

705
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:36,556
Not that again!

706
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,058
Let's stop this, Mr. Sagami.

707
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:38,975
Huh?

708
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:43,689
Even when we had her locked up,
the cracks continued to grow every year.

709
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:47,442
No matter how much
the Sacred Machine closes cracks,

710
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,736
the end of this world is near.

711
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:52,489
It will end?

712
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:53,990
-"End"?
-It's going to end?

713
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:55,992
-What does he mean?
-What happens when it ends?

714
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,370
-Wait a minute!
-Will we disappear?

715
00:49:58,453 --> 00:50:01,248
-We're going to die?
-We aren't alive anyway.

716
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:04,209
Tokimune… What have you done…

717
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:08,880
We did what you said

718
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:12,676
because we had no idea
what this world was and we felt lost.

719
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:14,970
But, I ask everyone.

720
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:18,223
Do we need rules
that deceive an ending world?

721
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:19,766
That's a good point.

722
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:23,145
If it's going to end anyway,
there's no need to listen to Sagami.

723
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:27,023
-That's right!
-Let's just do what we want.

724
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:36,241
That doesn't make sense!

725
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:40,203
He's gone crazy! What?!
You're not making any sense!

726
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,121
Mr. Sagami.

727
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:48,253
You all don't care
what happens to this world?!

728
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:51,339
Is there nobody here
who can think straight?

729
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:53,258
Am I the only one making sense?

730
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:55,177
That's enough, old man.

731
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:57,012
Mutsumi.

732
00:50:57,679 --> 00:50:58,597
Y-You…

733
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:07,731
This world may be an illusion,
but you need to get a grip on reality!

734
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:10,233
If the world is ending, let's eat!

735
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:13,904
I can't believe we followed that guy.

736
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:26,917
She sure has energy.

737
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,002
How was reality?

738
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:32,339
It looked like a ruin.

739
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:33,965
Because of the accident?

740
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:36,510
There must have been a lot of deaths.

741
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:40,347
If the steel factory is gone
then Mifuse must be done for.

742
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,683
Mifuse?

743
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:51,024
The truth is, everyone had already
realized what had happened.

744
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:55,779
Every time we hung out,
we always did things that hurt.

745
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:57,405
Because…

746
00:51:57,989 --> 00:52:00,367
we never really felt pain.

747
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:03,286
As existence that cannot be erased.

748
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:07,707
Never feeling cold
while living in a winter.

749
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:16,508
While holding onto
all of these vague sensations,

750
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:20,929
we had come to realize early on…

751
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:24,182
We are all an illusion.

752
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:29,563
It's okay! You might as well go
and confess your feelings now.

753
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:31,064
But I…

754
00:52:31,147 --> 00:52:32,983
It's not that easy.

755
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:34,526
I mean…

756
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:38,446
You said it'd be awkward
if you went to the same high school,

757
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:41,867
but you can no longer
go to the same high school.

758
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:44,494
You like him, right?

759
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:46,913
I do.

760
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:49,082
I do like him, but…

761
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:51,334
It hurts?

762
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:59,259
Love hurts?

763
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:05,932
It hurts, but how should I say…

764
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:08,310
It's a sweet pain.

765
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:16,234
Hara, I’m sorry, but that’s hilarious.

766
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:17,861
W-What's so funny?!

767
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:18,904
"Sweet"?

768
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:21,197
She means it hurts but it's also sweet.

769
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:23,992
It hurts but you like that,
don't you, Hara?

770
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:27,704
I'm going to shut you up forever!

771
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:29,539
Stop it!

772
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,625
Hey, the bus is coming!

773
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,752
You sure are close. Are you two a thing?

774
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:35,045
Huh?!

775
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:39,007
No, no. It's not me
that Hara has a crush on…

776
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,510
You sure have a lot of energy, Hara.

777
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:44,095
Of course!

778
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:48,266
If your name is called, come pick it up.

779
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:50,226
Aoyama!

780
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:51,186
Here.

781
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:52,979
-Ueda.
-Here.

782
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,607
There's no point in getting them back now.

783
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:56,775
-Let's burn it.
-Kikuiri.

784
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:58,109
Oh, here.

785
00:53:58,193 --> 00:53:59,486
SELF-MONITORING FORM

786
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:04,574
You were able to
avoid turning them in after all.

787
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:05,659
I apologize.

788
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:08,954
Guess you were right this entire time.

789
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:15,293
Is there anything that is right…

790
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,339
in this world?

791
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:49,786
Senba?!

792
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:52,497
Hey, don't look!

793
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,708
You'll get a crack in your soul!

794
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:58,378
The gods must be testing us!

795
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:00,797
By creating this difficult situation,

796
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:05,635
the true heroes to lead the fools
of this land shall be revealed!

797
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,721
Nice! That's exactly right!

798
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:10,974
Yeah! Am I the hero? Amazing!

799
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:12,600
I’m trembling with excitement!

800
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:14,561
They sure are energetic.

801
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:24,696
Senba's dad's eyebrows
look exactly like Senba's.

802
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:26,322
Yeah.

803
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:30,076
Why do people have to go and disappear?

804
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:33,580
Senba had a dream…

805
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:35,415
A dream?

806
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:38,501
Damn it, I can't take it.

807
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:40,211
It's all a pile of shit.

808
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:43,423
That's enough. The wolf's going to come.

809
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,301
Are you sure it's okay?

810
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:47,677
Of course!

811
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:50,472
I'll look after her when you're at school.

812
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:54,184
It's so rare for Masamune
to ask for something.

813
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:57,228
Hey!

814
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:59,647
I'm so sorry, sir.

815
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:02,567
It's okay, she doesn't know any better.

816
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:05,320
Sweet… I like this!

817
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:07,739
Oh, that's good! Eat some more.

818
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:11,993
But it doesn't hurt.

819
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:15,789
Masamine!

820
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:18,083
-Look, look!
-Oh, my jacket.

821
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:19,626
It looks good on you.

822
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:26,549
I used the bath.

823
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:27,842
Okay.

824
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,303
Were there enough towels?

825
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:31,679
Yes.

826
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:56,204
What?

827
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:59,290
Look. It's done, Mutsumi.

828
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:03,878
My father and grandfather
will come riding on this.

829
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:05,713
It's kinda cute.

830
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:07,048
The evening paper came.

831
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:11,427
Originally, they said there might not be
fireworks at this year's Obon Festival.

832
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:14,055
They're running
the steel factory train too?

833
00:57:14,722 --> 00:57:16,933
But I guess this will be the last time.

834
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:19,352
Right. It'll be the last time.

835
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:21,813
I'll make some coffee.

836
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:48,339
Don't!

837
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:57,640
You can see reality even indoors now…

838
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:13,239
The Sacred Wolf.

839
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,533
Why aren't you surprised?

840
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:21,164
The girl had a backpack on.

841
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:23,625
And there was a name tag.

842
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:26,044
Saki Kikuiri.

843
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:28,755
So Itsumi is our--

844
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:30,215
She's not my child.

845
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:33,593
But that woman was you!

846
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:35,887
That's the me in reality.

847
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:38,890
She's a completely different person
from the me in this world.

848
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:43,478
But when we were eating,
you acted like you were Itsumi’s mother…

849
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:47,315
If I were her mother,

850
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:50,735
I wouldn't have locked her up like that.

851
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:55,406
I wouldn't have let her suffer
for all of those years.

852
00:58:57,075 --> 00:59:00,745
But that person
must have been a kind mother.

853
00:59:01,412 --> 00:59:02,497
Even now…

854
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:05,458
she continues to wait
for her lost daughter.

855
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:10,338
But there's no way
for Itsumi to return to reality.

856
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:28,439
Are you serious?

857
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:31,734
I'm serious.

858
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:35,029
Really? That's unexpected.

859
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:36,614
I never realized.

860
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:40,243
I didn't plan on telling you.

861
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:41,160
But…

862
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:43,955
There's nothing left to be scared of.

863
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:46,082
I wanted to know how you felt, Nitta.

864
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:49,502
Why don't we date?

865
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:52,422
Really?

866
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:54,340
Really.

867
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:58,803
Does that mean you've liked me too?

868
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:02,932
Well, yeah, a little…

869
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,979
Hara, congratulations!

870
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:11,316
Kiss! Come on and kiss!

871
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:13,985
Love wins in the end!

872
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:35,840
Come on, you should have
gone home with Hara.

873
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:37,342
No.

874
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:41,554
I figured hanging out with
my pathetic friend would be more fun.

875
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:46,809
I think something is happening
between Masamune and Mutsumi, too.

876
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:47,727
I'm sure of it.

877
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,229
Yeah, definitely.

878
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:55,068
He's definitely touched her boobs.

879
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:59,072
MIFUSE

880
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:05,995
GAMES
AUTO SNACK MIFUSE

881
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:22,136
I turned on the heater.
We might be able to dry off.

882
01:01:30,978 --> 01:01:34,482
That was my first time
seeing someone confess their feelings.

883
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:35,900
What?

884
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:38,945
I thought Hara was more confident.

885
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:41,864
She was shaking, kind of weak.

886
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:43,616
Hara is a girly girl.

887
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,326
On her Self-Monitoring Form,

888
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:48,204
she said she wanted to be
the wife of someone she loved.

889
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:50,248
What did you write?

890
01:01:50,748 --> 01:01:51,582
A daycare worker.

891
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,669
You always lie about
things that don't matter.

892
01:01:54,752 --> 01:01:57,296
It's better than mulling over
things that don't matter

893
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:00,258
and not writing anything at all, isn't it?

894
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:04,303
You could have at least written down
"art teacher" or something.

895
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:06,723
Since you're good at drawing.

896
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:09,225
How do you know I like to draw?

897
01:02:09,308 --> 01:02:13,813
I don't know if you like it,
but I know you are good.

898
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:16,899
We’ve been in
the same class for years, you know?

899
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:18,901
I see…

900
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,821
Yeah, I’m sure of it now.

901
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:24,490
What is it?

902
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,661
I have feelings for you.

903
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:47,346
That's not fair.

904
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:57,398
You think because you have me in reality
that you can do the same with me here?

905
01:02:57,482 --> 01:02:58,775
You've known, right?

906
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:01,444
That from the beginning, I've liked you.

907
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:04,447
You knew from the very start!

908
01:03:05,072 --> 01:03:08,534
-That's why you used my feelings--
-I knew.

909
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:10,453
Mutsumi.

910
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:13,456
But I…

911
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:22,924
I don't like you.

912
01:03:28,095 --> 01:03:29,138
Hey!

913
01:03:31,557 --> 01:03:33,726
-Wait up!
-I'm not waiting!

914
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:36,312
You're such an idiot, Masamune!

915
01:03:36,395 --> 01:03:37,230
Hey, I--

916
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:40,525
We are not the same people
that are in reality!

917
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:42,193
We aren't even alive!

918
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:44,153
None of this matters!

919
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:57,416
I-I'm sorry.

920
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:02,213
See?

921
01:04:04,048 --> 01:04:05,550
I don't smell, right?

922
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:10,513
Because I'm an illusion.

923
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:11,806
It's the snow.

924
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:16,018
The smell is absorbed and disappears.

925
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:19,564
I don't smell because I'm not alive.

926
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:21,315
But I…

927
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:24,777
I can hear your heartbeat, it's fast.

928
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:27,738
That has nothing to do with being alive.

929
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:28,739
Then…

930
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:31,951
that means you do love me.

931
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:33,578
I don't.

932
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:34,787
Liar.

933
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:35,997
You're an idiot.

934
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:40,167
Being with Itsumi,

935
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:44,589
I feel like I finally have the answer
to why I've been feeling so hazy.

936
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:49,510
She tries to see everything
with her eyes wide open.

937
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:51,512
She is moved deeply

938
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,432
by everything she feels.

939
01:04:57,143 --> 01:05:00,354
I realized that's what it means to live.

940
01:05:00,938 --> 01:05:02,481
I learned that from Itsumi.

941
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:04,525
But,

942
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:07,695
you taught me what comes after.

943
01:05:07,778 --> 01:05:08,613
Huh?

944
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:13,242
I get annoyed just looking at you.

945
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:15,995
I get interested in everything you say.

946
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:19,832
You get on my nerves
and then you excite me.

947
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:21,792
It's not just Itsumi.

948
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:26,422
I'm also really alive, even here.

949
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:31,469
When I'm with you, I feel it so strongly.

950
01:05:39,977 --> 01:05:42,021
Your heartbeat is fast too, Masamune.

951
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:49,028
If we do this,

952
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:51,822
it'll beat even faster.

953
01:06:49,714 --> 01:06:53,009
It's turning into rain.

954
01:06:55,469 --> 01:06:57,638
It… It's summer…

955
01:07:00,307 --> 01:07:01,225
I'm sorry.

956
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:05,146
I don't want to stop.

957
01:07:14,488 --> 01:07:15,948
My chest might explode.

958
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:19,994
My heart…

959
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:22,747
feels so tight.

960
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:43,184
It hurts…

961
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:48,522
It hurts…

962
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:52,902
It hurts!

963
01:07:56,906 --> 01:08:00,242
-Hurry up!
-Let's go!

964
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:12,088
The smoke…

965
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:14,507
It stopped.

966
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:25,059
So many cracks.

967
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:34,735
Nitta! Run!

968
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:50,042
It's not only in the sky?

969
01:09:00,761 --> 01:09:01,762
What happened?

970
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:05,307
Itsumi!

971
01:09:11,188 --> 01:09:13,065
Itsumi, why are you out here?

972
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:14,608
Left out!

973
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:16,777
I'm left out!

974
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:18,612
What are you saying Itsumi?

975
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:21,490
Calm down!

976
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,168
Emergency announcement.

977
01:09:32,251 --> 01:09:35,838
The Sacred Wolf has stopped.
Please evacuate immediately.

978
01:09:35,921 --> 01:09:37,673
Prepare for the evacuation!

979
01:09:37,756 --> 01:09:42,344
If you are in the Momose Area
or the Ashina Area, please evacuate to…

980
01:09:46,098 --> 01:09:50,102
After learning the truth,
many people wished to disappear.

981
01:09:50,936 --> 01:09:55,107
The Sacred Machine worked incessantly
to close the cracks in our hearts.

982
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:57,651
It continued to produce the Sacred Wolf.

983
01:09:58,694 --> 01:10:01,530
So we think
the blast furnace was overloaded.

984
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:03,073
Incorrect.

985
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:05,993
It's obviously because
you let the woman of the gods leave!

986
01:10:06,076 --> 01:10:06,952
That's right!

987
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:08,412
You understand now, you fools?

988
01:10:08,495 --> 01:10:09,330
What?!

989
01:10:09,413 --> 01:10:11,332
There you go again, spouting nonsense.

990
01:10:11,415 --> 01:10:13,500
Without the Sacred Wolf,

991
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:17,338
it won't be long until
reality floods in through the cracks.

992
01:10:18,672 --> 01:10:22,509
Unfortunately, our world
has come to an end.

993
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:36,607
-Mr. Sagami!
-Mr. Sagami!

994
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:38,734
What's his problem?

995
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:55,668
Masamune, can you come here?

996
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:57,461
We found this.

997
01:10:58,170 --> 01:11:00,089
A notebook your dad left behind.

998
01:11:00,172 --> 01:11:02,383
He kept writing in it
even after the event.

999
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:05,844
Dad's diary?

1000
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:12,059
A landslide occurred at Mt. Kanzari.

1001
01:11:12,142 --> 01:11:13,811
The cracks are severe.

1002
01:11:14,478 --> 01:11:17,314
It’s the first time
since the day of the explosion.

1003
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:25,948
Since I worked the night shift that day,
I must have died in reality.

1004
01:11:29,576 --> 01:11:32,496
We found a small girl
on the freight train.

1005
01:11:33,664 --> 01:11:35,291
She had a unique odor.

1006
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,461
This girl rode in
on the train from reality.

1007
01:11:41,046 --> 01:11:44,883
If the machine that carves
the god mountain is a sacred machine,

1008
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:47,845
then so must be
the machine that carries it.

1009
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:52,057
So if she rides on the train,
Itsumi can go home?

1010
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:53,809
I don't know.

1011
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:59,648
The laws of physics are
different in reality and in this world.

1012
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:02,401
We had no idea what effect it might have

1013
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:08,282
for a girl from reality
to exist in an immaterial illusion.

1014
01:12:09,908 --> 01:12:12,244
Return that girl to reality?

1015
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:15,706
Yes, for example, if she gets older

1016
01:12:15,789 --> 01:12:21,295
and begins to lose control of her feelings
it's possible it could affect this world.

1017
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:25,382
Itsumi's feelings
have an effect on this world?

1018
01:12:25,466 --> 01:12:28,093
Yes, that's what your father told me.

1019
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:29,470
But Sagami…

1020
01:12:31,472 --> 01:12:34,808
I was thinking the same thing,
Mr. Akimune!

1021
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:39,980
The girl chosen by the gods
must not lose control of her feelings.

1022
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:43,400
How impure that would be!

1023
01:12:45,944 --> 01:12:49,156
So then, we should lock her
in the Sacred Machine.

1024
01:12:49,239 --> 01:12:52,242
It's to protect this world!

1025
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:55,329
A philosopher once said,

1026
01:12:55,412 --> 01:12:59,541
"Hope is a dream
seen by those who are awake."

1027
01:13:05,839 --> 01:13:07,299
Saki Kikuiri.

1028
01:13:10,177 --> 01:13:11,595
It's ironic.

1029
01:13:12,513 --> 01:13:16,767
It was because of this world
that I was able to meet her.

1030
01:13:17,434 --> 01:13:22,606
She was born after I died
and brought hope to my family.

1031
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:24,441
My granddaughter.

1032
01:13:26,151 --> 01:13:27,361
So he knew.

1033
01:13:32,282 --> 01:13:35,702
In a hopeless world
that continues at her expense,

1034
01:13:36,453 --> 01:13:38,664
Masamune is drawing yet again today.

1035
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:44,294
No matter how good he gets at drawing,
he will never be an adult.

1036
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:46,755
It will never lead him to his future.

1037
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:49,258
But…

1038
01:13:51,343 --> 01:13:52,678
Stop it!

1039
01:13:53,303 --> 01:13:55,013
…he's getting better and better.

1040
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:59,226
Even in this abnormal world,
people can change as much as they want.

1041
01:13:59,309 --> 01:14:01,895
That's what I think
when I look at Masamune.

1042
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:02,813
Yeah…

1043
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:05,107
That's right.

1044
01:14:06,024 --> 01:14:07,151
I…

1045
01:14:08,026 --> 01:14:09,236
I've gotten good.

1046
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:14,241
Even if I get good at drawing,
it doesn't mean I can leave this place.

1047
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:16,702
Even if none of this matters…

1048
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:20,789
I've gotten better
after drawing every day.

1049
01:14:22,082 --> 01:14:23,750
I'm really happy.

1050
01:14:23,834 --> 01:14:26,712
That I got better and got praised for it.

1051
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:30,215
It doesn't matter
that it won't lead to a future.

1052
01:14:30,924 --> 01:14:34,136
It's been fun and exciting.

1053
01:14:34,219 --> 01:14:38,015
I've been alive here.

1054
01:14:38,098 --> 01:14:43,061
Despite this,
we stole that child's chance to change.

1055
01:14:46,064 --> 01:14:49,318
I want to change, just like Masamune.

1056
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:53,989
But it just wasn't possible for me.

1057
01:15:13,091 --> 01:15:14,551
Masamune.

1058
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:16,345
I want you to forgive your father.

1059
01:15:16,428 --> 01:15:18,847
There's no forgiving or not forgiving.

1060
01:15:20,265 --> 01:15:23,477
I'm just happy to be praised by him.

1061
01:15:28,398 --> 01:15:31,235
Uncle, I want to take her back.

1062
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:34,238
I want to take back Itsumi to reality.

1063
01:15:35,447 --> 01:15:36,657
Masamune.

1064
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:40,661
Phew! Masamune, take care of Grandpa!

1065
01:15:44,581 --> 01:15:47,000
Alright, now for us…

1066
01:15:50,128 --> 01:15:50,963
What is it?

1067
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:52,923
You see…

1068
01:15:53,882 --> 01:15:56,843
There's something I want to tell you.
Is that okay?

1069
01:15:57,719 --> 01:15:59,888
No, I don't want to hear it.

1070
01:16:01,473 --> 01:16:07,563
If everything is going to end,
I want it to end while being a good mom.

1071
01:16:23,203 --> 01:16:24,871
I see it's Obon there.

1072
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:28,083
The Obon Festival was always fun.

1073
01:16:28,166 --> 01:16:31,336
There were tons of fireworks
and food stalls.

1074
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:34,089
Yakisoba, candied apples…

1075
01:16:38,176 --> 01:16:43,515
I don't think
this world was created as a punishment.

1076
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:44,433
Grandpa?

1077
01:16:45,392 --> 01:16:47,936
I'm here with you.

1078
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:52,649
The gods of Mifuse

1079
01:16:52,733 --> 01:16:57,654
must have known this land would end
with the explosion of the factory.

1080
01:16:57,738 --> 01:17:02,951
So they must have wanted to preserve
the best days we ever had.

1081
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:07,873
When everyone praised the town.
The happiest of times.

1082
01:17:15,797 --> 01:17:17,633
I ask for your understanding.

1083
01:17:18,383 --> 01:17:22,554
Just like in reality,
we can operate the factory.

1084
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:25,474
Then we can
create the Sacred Wolf ourselves.

1085
01:17:25,557 --> 01:17:30,020
-You said the world was ending anyway!
-There's no point in struggling.

1086
01:17:30,103 --> 01:17:31,188
You're right!

1087
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:36,360
It may be pointless
even if we make the Sacred Wolf appear.

1088
01:17:37,527 --> 01:17:40,238
Even so,
if we had one more year or half a year…

1089
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:45,369
No, if this world can continue
even for just one more day…

1090
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:48,330
we won't give up!

1091
01:17:49,122 --> 01:17:53,168
-That's what I'm talking about!
-Good job, Kikuiri! You've got guts!

1092
01:17:53,251 --> 01:17:56,588
Are you serious?!
You said you'd wait until Itsumi escaped!

1093
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:59,216
-Sorry, but I am serious.
-Huh?

1094
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:03,804
Just as you want to save that girl,
there's someone I want to save.

1095
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:10,602
I don't plan on letting Misato end
as a good mom.

1096
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:19,236
What the hell is his problem?

1097
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:24,449
The cracks in the tunnel should be
connected to the outside of Mifuse.

1098
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:27,160
If we can get her there
on the train from reality…

1099
01:18:27,244 --> 01:18:28,620
Who's going to be driving it?

1100
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:29,830
Well…

1101
01:18:29,913 --> 01:18:32,249
We just have to give it a shot!

1102
01:18:32,332 --> 01:18:35,877
Before that lovesick geezer
revives the Sacred Wolf!

1103
01:18:37,003 --> 01:18:38,296
Lovesick?

1104
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:40,424
Itsumi!

1105
01:18:40,507 --> 01:18:42,008
I said stop it!

1106
01:18:42,092 --> 01:18:43,677
Itsumi's not going!

1107
01:18:44,344 --> 01:18:46,888
Wait, she doesn't want to
go back to reality?

1108
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:49,433
Of course she doesn't.

1109
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:53,103
I bet she doesn't even remember
what it was like.

1110
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:56,356
Hey, if she doesn't want to go

1111
01:18:57,065 --> 01:18:59,901
wouldn't it be better to not force her?

1112
01:18:59,985 --> 01:19:02,863
Hey, this world is coming to an end.

1113
01:19:03,447 --> 01:19:06,408
Man, she's just like an animal.

1114
01:19:06,491 --> 01:19:08,452
We have a chance to save Itsumi.

1115
01:19:08,535 --> 01:19:12,289
But it might speed up
the end of this world, you know?

1116
01:19:12,372 --> 01:19:13,832
That's too ominous!

1117
01:19:13,915 --> 01:19:15,667
It's not impossible.

1118
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:17,169
Stop it.

1119
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:19,504
Just when things are going well…

1120
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:23,967
Mutsumi.

1121
01:19:24,468 --> 01:19:25,802
What do you…

1122
01:19:26,970 --> 01:19:28,722
Hey, Mutsumi!

1123
01:19:30,724 --> 01:19:31,475
Hey!

1124
01:19:34,227 --> 01:19:38,732
Don't get cocky just because we kissed.

1125
01:19:40,317 --> 01:19:41,651
Itsumi saw us.

1126
01:19:41,735 --> 01:19:42,611
Huh?

1127
01:19:42,694 --> 01:19:46,990
It makes sense
why the cracks suddenly grew.

1128
01:19:48,742 --> 01:19:52,496
They had me looking after Itsumi

1129
01:19:52,996 --> 01:19:57,417
because the woman of the gods
must not fall in love with a boy.

1130
01:19:58,251 --> 01:20:01,671
But Itsumi fell in love with you.

1131
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:11,014
Hey, Masamune! It's Itsumi!

1132
01:20:16,436 --> 01:20:20,565
Will it be okay using raw fuel
for the first time after 10 years?

1133
01:20:21,566 --> 01:20:24,152
Don't worry, it'll work.

1134
01:20:24,236 --> 01:20:26,863
I forgot how this feels.

1135
01:20:26,947 --> 01:20:28,156
Mr. Kikuiri.

1136
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:31,201
Sagami is doing something weird
at the 5th Blast Furnace.

1137
01:20:31,284 --> 01:20:32,118
Leave him be.

1138
01:20:32,202 --> 01:20:33,453
Are you sure?

1139
01:20:33,537 --> 01:20:34,955
Sagami is amazing.

1140
01:20:35,038 --> 01:20:38,250
From the very beginning,
he just wanted to have fun in this world.

1141
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:39,334
That's right.

1142
01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:45,257
We all could have changed our future with
a single thought, anywhere at any time.

1143
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:47,801
We were just too late to realize.

1144
01:20:48,593 --> 01:20:49,511
Let's do it.

1145
01:20:57,894 --> 01:21:04,901
We are undeserving to utter your name
Great god of Izanagi

1146
01:21:04,985 --> 01:21:07,571
-Where's Itsumi?
-She's not here.

1147
01:21:08,989 --> 01:21:15,328
In Tsukushi near Himuka-no-Tachibana…

1148
01:21:15,412 --> 01:21:17,789
There's a staircase ahead.
She might be up there.

1149
01:21:41,146 --> 01:21:42,147
She's beautiful.

1150
01:21:45,483 --> 01:21:47,193
We've come for you, Itsumi!

1151
01:21:49,821 --> 01:21:51,698
It was really a hassle.

1152
01:21:51,781 --> 01:21:54,534
She didn't want to take off
that dirty jacket.

1153
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:59,915
But she is the one
who chose to remain here.

1154
01:21:59,998 --> 01:22:05,170
Why are you trying to interfere when she
is willingly becoming a woman of the gods?

1155
01:22:05,253 --> 01:22:07,005
You know nothing! Itsumi is--

1156
01:22:07,088 --> 01:22:08,840
Itsumi stays here!

1157
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:12,844
She's quite beautiful.

1158
01:22:13,428 --> 01:22:16,306
Your mother must have been
beautiful as well.

1159
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:19,059
However…

1160
01:22:19,643 --> 01:22:24,356
like you, she has those eyes
that seem to mock me.

1161
01:22:24,439 --> 01:22:26,358
Not that it matters now.

1162
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:31,196
I've never heard Mom
say anything bad about you.

1163
01:22:33,156 --> 01:22:35,367
Th-That doesn't matter either.

1164
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:39,579
Why the hell was my dad
friends with this guy?

1165
01:22:40,288 --> 01:22:41,122
"Friends"?

1166
01:22:41,206 --> 01:22:45,043
D-Did Mr. Akimune
really say that about me?

1167
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:47,295
It doesn't matter now, right?

1168
01:22:47,837 --> 01:22:50,090
That does matter!

1169
01:22:51,091 --> 01:22:52,050
Let's go!

1170
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:53,551
No!

1171
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:54,844
Answer me!

1172
01:23:02,018 --> 01:23:03,645
Hurry up and chase them!

1173
01:23:03,728 --> 01:23:06,648
No! I won't go!

1174
01:23:06,731 --> 01:23:08,608
Itsumi doesn't want to!

1175
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:10,402
I don't want to!

1176
01:23:12,278 --> 01:23:14,197
Itsumi, calm down.

1177
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:16,032
Why is the train here?

1178
01:23:16,741 --> 01:23:18,493
Wait, it's dangerous!

1179
01:23:20,537 --> 01:23:21,871
Grandpa?!

1180
01:23:39,723 --> 01:23:42,392
Man, that's so reckless!

1181
01:23:42,475 --> 01:23:43,518
She's just assertive.

1182
01:23:43,601 --> 01:23:45,812
No, she's a crazy driver.

1183
01:23:49,816 --> 01:23:52,736
Alright, let's take this
all the way to the tunnel.

1184
01:24:07,751 --> 01:24:09,502
I-I'm sorry!

1185
01:24:09,586 --> 01:24:11,171
What happened?

1186
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:16,134
Kikuiri!

1187
01:24:16,634 --> 01:24:17,719
Get Itsumi in here!

1188
01:24:17,802 --> 01:24:20,638
Masamune! Don't trust Hara!

1189
01:24:25,018 --> 01:24:27,479
They took Itsumi…

1190
01:24:30,607 --> 01:24:32,317
You drive so aggressively!

1191
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:33,318
Shut up, I'm sorry!

1192
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:36,237
Itsumi!

1193
01:24:36,321 --> 01:24:40,283
Love hurts, but the meaning is different.

1194
01:24:40,867 --> 01:24:45,371
Love is the feeling of
wanting to be with a person

1195
01:24:45,455 --> 01:24:50,710
today and tomorrow,
and even when you become an old grandma!

1196
01:24:55,924 --> 01:24:58,176
Kikuiri and the others are here!

1197
01:24:58,259 --> 01:24:59,594
-Go faster!
-Hey wait!

1198
01:24:59,677 --> 01:25:04,224
-Go faster! More, more!
-Itsumi!

1199
01:25:06,226 --> 01:25:07,811
I'm sorry about her.

1200
01:25:07,894 --> 01:25:10,146
Nitta, call out to the criminal.

1201
01:25:10,230 --> 01:25:11,064
Okay!

1202
01:25:13,483 --> 01:25:15,026
Hara, please reconsider!

1203
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:15,944
No!

1204
01:25:16,027 --> 01:25:18,863
Itsumi, Itsumi!

1205
01:25:18,947 --> 01:25:20,156
What's that?

1206
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:21,950
Is that festival music?

1207
01:25:22,033 --> 01:25:23,868
Reality is just on the other side.

1208
01:25:24,869 --> 01:25:26,955
I'm starting to get pumped!

1209
01:25:31,835 --> 01:25:33,086
Get away, you pervert!

1210
01:25:34,003 --> 01:25:35,213
Get back, pervert!

1211
01:25:35,296 --> 01:25:36,548
Not you, Nitta!

1212
01:25:36,631 --> 01:25:37,966
Shut up, you…

1213
01:25:45,306 --> 01:25:46,349
Wh-What do I do?

1214
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:56,067
Nitta! No, no, no!

1215
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:57,402
Don't die!

1216
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:03,032
Gotcha!

1217
01:26:03,616 --> 01:26:05,702
Turns out you still have a heart!

1218
01:26:06,703 --> 01:26:08,121
You tricked me.

1219
01:26:08,204 --> 01:26:12,959
If you do not return the woman of the gods
there will be divine punishment!

1220
01:26:13,042 --> 01:26:14,127
It's Sagami!

1221
01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:19,507
The more you resist,
the more your spirit will be cursed

1222
01:26:19,591 --> 01:26:24,470
leading to your ultimate destruction!

1223
01:26:24,554 --> 01:26:26,890
Ah, the gods are angry!

1224
01:26:28,266 --> 01:26:32,228
We're out of time!
She's going to disappear along with us.

1225
01:26:32,312 --> 01:26:34,814
We can't let that happen.
She's our daughter!

1226
01:26:35,481 --> 01:26:36,482
She isn't though.

1227
01:26:39,611 --> 01:26:40,486
Huh?

1228
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:41,654
Don't rush it.

1229
01:26:41,738 --> 01:26:44,407
Damn it! Push the car!

1230
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:49,829
Mutsumi!

1231
01:27:13,895 --> 01:27:16,856
I see… That's right.

1232
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:21,027
We can laugh and we can cry.

1233
01:27:21,861 --> 01:27:25,865
Even in this world,
we could have been as free as we wanted.

1234
01:27:26,783 --> 01:27:30,578
But, it's different for us in reality.

1235
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:32,455
Please! I want this!

1236
01:27:36,668 --> 01:27:38,253
Mama!

1237
01:27:38,336 --> 01:27:39,837
Look at this!

1238
01:27:41,130 --> 01:27:42,507
I want this!

1239
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:46,094
Don't touch it, it's for sale.

1240
01:27:48,304 --> 01:27:50,640
I won't move until you buy me it.

1241
01:27:50,723 --> 01:27:53,059
Okay, then go ahead.

1242
01:27:53,142 --> 01:27:56,646
We're going to go now. Let's go, Masamune.

1243
01:27:57,230 --> 01:27:58,064
Are you sure?

1244
01:27:58,648 --> 01:28:00,108
It's okay.

1245
01:28:00,191 --> 01:28:01,985
She'll give up and come after us.

1246
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:09,867
Saki?

1247
01:28:10,868 --> 01:28:12,287
Saki?

1248
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:15,873
Excuse me, did you see
a girl that was just there?

1249
01:28:15,957 --> 01:28:17,959
She's five and she…

1250
01:28:18,042 --> 01:28:20,420
Here's your change.

1251
01:28:20,503 --> 01:28:22,422
They can go anywhere they want…

1252
01:28:24,507 --> 01:28:28,303
but they're stuck with feelings
that can't go anywhere.

1253
01:28:30,888 --> 01:28:33,558
It's not that I want to free just Itsumi!

1254
01:28:34,726 --> 01:28:37,979
I also want to free us in reality.

1255
01:28:39,897 --> 01:28:41,316
"Us"?

1256
01:28:43,985 --> 01:28:45,987
If you fully enter reality,
you'll disappear.

1257
01:28:46,696 --> 01:28:48,448
It's no use Mr. Kikuiri!

1258
01:28:48,531 --> 01:28:49,991
-It's all over!
-It's not over!

1259
01:28:56,914 --> 01:28:59,292
It's not over. It can't be over!

1260
01:29:11,637 --> 01:29:12,972
The Sacred Wolf!

1261
01:29:18,394 --> 01:29:19,771
Stop!

1262
01:29:23,066 --> 01:29:24,942
Our prayers have been answered!

1263
01:29:26,736 --> 01:29:27,862
Alright, get in!

1264
01:29:28,696 --> 01:29:30,323
The Sacred Wolf is back.

1265
01:29:30,406 --> 01:29:33,284
We have to return Itsumi
before the tunnel closes.

1266
01:29:33,868 --> 01:29:34,702
Back to reality.

1267
01:29:34,786 --> 01:29:37,580
-A commemorative train will be arriving.
-Um, excuse me.

1268
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:39,999
Could you take our picture?

1269
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:41,959
Sure.

1270
01:29:51,844 --> 01:29:54,388
That's right! The train from reality!

1271
01:29:54,472 --> 01:29:56,265
If we get her on that train…

1272
01:29:56,349 --> 01:29:57,725
How?

1273
01:29:57,809 --> 01:29:59,560
It's on the other side.

1274
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:01,104
I'll figure it out.

1275
01:30:10,738 --> 01:30:12,073
We're in the crack!

1276
01:30:12,156 --> 01:30:14,325
At this rate, we'll disappear!

1277
01:30:14,408 --> 01:30:15,243
I know!

1278
01:30:15,827 --> 01:30:19,664
But the only way to
get her on that train was to dive in.

1279
01:30:25,837 --> 01:30:28,214
From our listener, "Sleeping Lamb."

1280
01:30:28,297 --> 01:30:30,133
-What?
-"DJ Naoto, good evening."

1281
01:30:30,216 --> 01:30:32,009
Senba liked this program.

1282
01:30:32,093 --> 01:30:34,220
"I hate studying for entrance exams."

1283
01:30:34,303 --> 01:30:36,931
"I feel like dying."

1284
01:30:37,974 --> 01:30:40,351
Really? If that's the case, then die!

1285
01:30:40,434 --> 01:30:41,310
Die!

1286
01:30:41,894 --> 01:30:43,312
Hey, don't say that!

1287
01:30:44,981 --> 01:30:48,025
You don't even know what it means to die.

1288
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:49,944
Don't make light of it!

1289
01:30:50,528 --> 01:30:52,530
We don't know what it means either!

1290
01:30:53,072 --> 01:30:54,740
And I don't want to know!

1291
01:30:59,412 --> 01:31:01,247
"I don't like feeling I've nowhere to go."

1292
01:31:01,330 --> 01:31:03,082
If you look, you'll find somewhere.

1293
01:31:05,668 --> 01:31:07,879
"It feels like it's always dark
no matter how far I go."

1294
01:31:07,962 --> 01:31:11,007
There are shining lights if you look!

1295
01:31:17,597 --> 01:31:20,975
"A new environment might help me find
what I want to become."

1296
01:31:21,058 --> 01:31:24,645
"Then, I think I can become
a better version of myself."

1297
01:31:24,729 --> 01:31:28,316
"If I get into high school,
I'll dye my hair and go on a diet."

1298
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:29,775
You can change even if you don't!

1299
01:31:29,859 --> 01:31:31,152
"I'll get a part-time job."

1300
01:31:31,235 --> 01:31:35,740
"I'll read one book a week
and even help my parents sometimes."

1301
01:31:35,823 --> 01:31:38,993
"So please let me pass the exams."

1302
01:31:39,785 --> 01:31:42,413
"Please, god!"

1303
01:31:52,715 --> 01:31:53,799
What happened?

1304
01:31:53,883 --> 01:31:56,677
I thought a car flew onto the tracks.

1305
01:31:56,761 --> 01:32:01,057
What? We're on the overpass,
is that even possible?

1306
01:32:04,477 --> 01:32:06,604
No, I don't want to.

1307
01:32:06,687 --> 01:32:08,564
Please Itsumi, we have to--

1308
01:32:08,648 --> 01:32:10,399
I'm not going!

1309
01:32:10,483 --> 01:32:13,527
Itsumi isn't going. Staying here.

1310
01:32:13,611 --> 01:32:16,697
I'm staying with Masamune and Mutsumi.

1311
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:18,157
Itsumi…

1312
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:21,410
When we first met…

1313
01:32:26,582 --> 01:32:27,583
Back then…

1314
01:32:31,128 --> 01:32:34,006
I thought I shouldn't get too close.

1315
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:36,676
Hey!

1316
01:32:38,678 --> 01:32:40,012
If I got close…

1317
01:32:41,013 --> 01:32:42,431
I knew…

1318
01:32:49,939 --> 01:32:51,899
I'd start to love.

1319
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:57,071
So you can say "Mutsumi" now?

1320
01:32:58,489 --> 01:33:00,491
I'll be with you, Itsumi.

1321
01:33:01,534 --> 01:33:02,410
Let's go together.

1322
01:33:13,921 --> 01:33:15,840
Let's go. You get on first.

1323
01:33:15,923 --> 01:33:18,509
Wait, if you go together, you'll…

1324
01:33:26,142 --> 01:33:27,601
Mutsumi!

1325
01:33:27,685 --> 01:33:28,936
I'm coming too.

1326
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:30,771
No, wait!

1327
01:33:30,855 --> 01:33:32,106
Masamune…

1328
01:33:36,610 --> 01:33:40,573
No! I don't want things to end like this!

1329
01:33:43,868 --> 01:33:46,620
Meeting the both of you…

1330
01:33:50,666 --> 01:33:53,919
has been so much fun.

1331
01:34:05,139 --> 01:34:06,849
Masamune!

1332
01:34:07,475 --> 01:34:09,310
Come down here!

1333
01:34:12,188 --> 01:34:14,065
Obon Festival fireworks.

1334
01:34:14,648 --> 01:34:18,527
I guess you can't see
the Sacred Wolf from this side.

1335
01:34:18,611 --> 01:34:20,196
And soon, I'll also be…

1336
01:34:20,738 --> 01:34:23,491
Get off. Mutsumi needs to get off.

1337
01:34:28,287 --> 01:34:30,039
A peppermint pipe?

1338
01:34:30,122 --> 01:34:31,665
I know what that is.

1339
01:34:34,251 --> 01:34:36,462
I used to like these.

1340
01:34:38,214 --> 01:34:40,216
The Obon Festival is fun.

1341
01:34:40,841 --> 01:34:45,513
You wear a yukata and you dance.
And there are so many shops.

1342
01:34:46,847 --> 01:34:50,434
But in my world, it's always winter.

1343
01:34:50,518 --> 01:34:52,520
Obon will never come.

1344
01:34:53,104 --> 01:34:53,938
Huh?

1345
01:34:55,398 --> 01:34:56,732
Hey, Itsumi.

1346
01:34:57,274 --> 01:35:00,277
It's not only Obon
that's waiting at the end of the tunnel.

1347
01:35:00,361 --> 01:35:02,613
There will be lots of different things.

1348
01:35:02,696 --> 01:35:06,867
Fun things, difficult things, sad things…

1349
01:35:06,951 --> 01:35:10,955
Things that are strong,
intense, and moving.

1350
01:35:11,956 --> 01:35:13,791
You can make friends.

1351
01:35:13,874 --> 01:35:15,418
You can even have dreams.

1352
01:35:15,501 --> 01:35:17,628
You might even get frustrated.

1353
01:35:18,546 --> 01:35:21,549
But if you get depressed
and you feel like it's all over,

1354
01:35:21,632 --> 01:35:24,969
you can always find a new dream.

1355
01:35:25,553 --> 01:35:26,887
I'm so jealous.

1356
01:35:27,471 --> 01:35:31,475
These are all things I will never have.

1357
01:35:35,396 --> 01:35:39,900
That's why I want you
to give me just one thing.

1358
01:35:42,862 --> 01:35:43,904
Look.

1359
01:35:50,536 --> 01:35:53,539
I'm taking Masamune's heart.

1360
01:35:53,622 --> 01:35:54,832
Huh?

1361
01:35:54,915 --> 01:35:56,584
The future is yours,

1362
01:35:56,667 --> 01:36:00,045
but Masamune's heart is mine.

1363
01:36:01,589 --> 01:36:04,049
Even if I disappear in reality,

1364
01:36:04,133 --> 01:36:09,722
I'll be the one Masamune thinks of
at the moment this world ends.

1365
01:36:09,805 --> 01:36:11,015
No!

1366
01:36:11,098 --> 01:36:14,935
And I'll also be thinking of
Masamune in that final moment.

1367
01:36:15,019 --> 01:36:16,937
No, no!

1368
01:36:17,021 --> 01:36:21,317
Masamune loves me
and I also love Masamune.

1369
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:23,235
I'm left behind!

1370
01:36:25,321 --> 01:36:26,655
That's right.

1371
01:36:27,615 --> 01:36:28,449
But…

1372
01:36:29,366 --> 01:36:31,619
there are people waiting for you.

1373
01:36:31,702 --> 01:36:35,289
People who will think of you all the time.

1374
01:37:08,656 --> 01:37:10,115
I hate you.

1375
01:37:12,785 --> 01:37:14,245
I hate you.

1376
01:37:15,412 --> 01:37:17,623
That's why I won't go with you.

1377
01:37:20,167 --> 01:37:21,919
I hate you!

1378
01:37:22,002 --> 01:37:23,170
Yeah…

1379
01:37:34,807 --> 01:37:36,392
We're almost at the tunnel!

1380
01:37:36,475 --> 01:37:38,519
The Sacred Wolf is swarming!

1381
01:37:38,602 --> 01:37:39,562
Hey, that's…

1382
01:37:40,354 --> 01:37:41,313
Mutsumi!

1383
01:38:05,588 --> 01:38:07,423
Masamune Kikuiri knew.

1384
01:38:19,393 --> 01:38:20,978
Ow…

1385
01:38:22,062 --> 01:38:24,565
What were you thinking?! You're bleeding!

1386
01:38:25,733 --> 01:38:28,152
Masamune! This is amazing!

1387
01:38:30,487 --> 01:38:32,031
It really hurts!

1388
01:38:34,116 --> 01:38:36,076
It's because you're here, Masamune.

1389
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:39,788
I can feel it in the cells in my body
that I am alive.

1390
01:38:40,414 --> 01:38:43,167
I don't care if this world ends today.

1391
01:38:43,250 --> 01:38:45,419
It doesn't matter
how much time we have left.

1392
01:38:46,003 --> 01:38:48,797
Right now, I am alive.

1393
01:38:48,881 --> 01:38:50,090
Mutsumi.

1394
01:39:38,722 --> 01:39:40,057
Itsumi.

1395
01:39:52,361 --> 01:39:54,655
Did we make it?

1396
01:39:57,658 --> 01:39:59,493
CLOSED

1397
01:39:59,576 --> 01:40:01,745
Alright, she made it!

1398
01:40:04,289 --> 01:40:05,416
Ow!

1399
01:40:06,166 --> 01:40:07,251
It hurts?

1400
01:40:07,334 --> 01:40:09,586
Don't copy Itsumi.

1401
01:40:15,884 --> 01:40:18,887
We are alive.

1402
01:40:50,753 --> 01:40:52,755
Go on your way, Itsumi.

1403
01:40:54,715 --> 01:40:57,092
Go and see the things we can't.

1404
01:40:57,801 --> 01:41:01,972
Go and smell every new smell.

1405
01:41:03,015 --> 01:41:05,768
You two, stop being so lovey-dovey!

1406
01:41:05,851 --> 01:41:11,356
As for us,
we don't know how long we have here.

1407
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:14,777
MASAMUNE KIKUIRI WILL LIVE
ALONGSIDE MUTSUMI SAGAMI

1408
01:41:20,365 --> 01:41:21,617
Do you hear that?

1409
01:41:23,619 --> 01:41:24,661
What is it?

1410
01:41:25,370 --> 01:41:27,623
I can hear a voice.

1411
01:41:28,373 --> 01:41:32,669
It's a voice like… a newborn baby.

1412
01:41:34,671 --> 01:41:35,964
It hurts.

1413
01:41:36,757 --> 01:41:39,134
It hurts…

1414
01:41:42,346 --> 01:41:45,307
It hurts!

1415
01:42:19,716 --> 01:42:22,845
Hello? Yeah. I arrived at Mifuse.

1416
01:42:24,429 --> 01:42:27,182
I was asleep since there was nobody else.

1417
01:42:27,850 --> 01:42:29,601
Yes, I know.

1418
01:42:30,185 --> 01:42:33,021
You're always worrying.
I told you it'll be okay.

1419
01:42:34,189 --> 01:42:37,234
The taxi is here. Tell mom I said hi.

1420
01:42:37,317 --> 01:42:38,193
Bye.

1421
01:42:38,694 --> 01:42:40,153
RESERVED

1422
01:42:40,237 --> 01:42:42,531
Please take me to the steel factory.

1423
01:42:43,198 --> 01:42:46,743
It's been a while
since I took someone to the factory.

1424
01:42:46,827 --> 01:42:51,415
A while ago there were a number of people
who liked looking at ruins.

1425
01:42:51,498 --> 01:42:54,209
But now, it's almost all demolished.

1426
01:42:54,793 --> 01:42:56,044
Here's a candy for you.

1427
01:42:56,128 --> 01:42:57,713
Oh, thank you.

1428
01:42:58,213 --> 01:43:01,216
It is creepy to just leave it though.

1429
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:05,137
A long time ago, there were
talks of people being spirited away.

1430
01:43:06,138 --> 01:43:08,223
Just rumors though.

1431
01:43:08,807 --> 01:43:10,642
Ah, I see.

1432
01:43:17,566 --> 01:43:19,610
MIFUSE STEEL FACTORY RUINS

1433
01:43:30,495 --> 01:43:34,333
THANK YOU

1434
01:43:34,416 --> 01:43:38,253
WE WON'T FORGET

1435
01:44:18,543 --> 01:44:22,547
GOODBYE MIFUSE STEEL FACTORY

1436
01:44:39,439 --> 01:44:41,316
This is where it happened.

1437
01:44:54,413 --> 01:44:55,664
My first…

1438
01:44:57,207 --> 01:44:59,126
heartbreak.

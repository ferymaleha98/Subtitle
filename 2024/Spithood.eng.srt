3
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:11,448
(suspenseful music)

4
00:00:38,167 --> 00:00:42,009
(suspenseful music continues)

5
00:01:08,353 --> 00:01:12,194
(suspenseful music continues)

6
00:01:38,204 --> 00:01:42,045
(suspenseful music continues)

7
00:02:08,306 --> 00:02:12,147
(suspenseful music continues)

8
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,036
(people chattering)

9
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,841
- It's bullshit.

10
00:03:07,842 --> 00:03:10,137
Straight up government crap.

11
00:03:10,138 --> 00:03:11,683
- I'm just happy to have a job.

12
00:03:13,186 --> 00:03:15,648
- This place is a piece of shit anyway.

13
00:03:15,649 --> 00:03:17,611
I'm glad it's getting shut down.

14
00:03:17,612 --> 00:03:19,238
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Andy.

15
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:21,075
- I'm on my last round today.

16
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,494
- Oh.
- Gosh, I'm gonna

17
00:03:22,495 --> 00:03:23,497
miss this place.

18
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:25,375
- How you doing, Andy?

19
00:03:25,376 --> 00:03:26,921
- I'm okay.

20
00:03:26,922 --> 00:03:27,964
- Good.
- I've been here

21
00:03:27,965 --> 00:03:29,593
30 years now.

22
00:03:29,594 --> 00:03:30,803
Made a lot of memories.

23
00:03:30,804 --> 00:03:32,056
- Yeah.

24
00:03:32,057 --> 00:03:33,266
- See you guys.

25
00:03:33,267 --> 00:03:34,267
- See you, bud.

26
00:03:35,689 --> 00:03:37,859
- 30 years. Fuck.

27
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,364
- Nothing to miss about this place.

28
00:03:40,365 --> 00:03:42,953
- Well, I'm looking forward
to a new work group.

29
00:03:42,954 --> 00:03:44,413
- Wish I could say the same.

30
00:03:44,414 --> 00:03:45,500
- What are you saying?

31
00:03:46,586 --> 00:03:48,632
- I'm saying I didn't get a new position.

32
00:03:49,884 --> 00:03:51,720
New technology. Pay cuts.

33
00:03:51,721 --> 00:03:52,721
I'm done.

34
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:55,604
Retirement won't be so bad.

35
00:03:56,731 --> 00:03:58,777
Drinking, fishing,

36
00:04:00,113 --> 00:04:01,030
banging Mrs. Jeeves.

37
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:02,952
- Ugh.
- Nice.

38
00:04:12,763 --> 00:04:14,308
- You ready for our last shift?

39
00:04:15,268 --> 00:04:17,272
- Yeah, there's just a lot of paperwork.

40
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:20,485
It's okay.
- It's our last shift, so.

41
00:04:20,486 --> 00:04:22,323
- I know, I know. You're right.

42
00:04:22,324 --> 00:04:25,955
Last shift.
- [Mason] So it is.

43
00:04:25,956 --> 00:04:27,668
- Can I ask you a question?

44
00:04:30,548 --> 00:04:33,054
(cup tapping)

45
00:04:34,014 --> 00:04:37,562
Is it time we told everyone about us?

46
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,275
- Mm, go for it.

47
00:04:40,276 --> 00:04:41,904
- Really?

48
00:04:41,905 --> 00:04:43,074
- Everyone knows anyway.

49
00:04:49,252 --> 00:04:50,254
- Who knows?

50
00:04:53,052 --> 00:04:54,889
- You're not gonna believe it.

51
00:05:00,859 --> 00:05:02,111
Hang on.

52
00:05:02,112 --> 00:05:04,365
Mason, do you copy?

53
00:05:04,366 --> 00:05:05,366
Mason, you there?

54
00:05:08,332 --> 00:05:10,378
- Answer it. We'll chat later.

55
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,091
- Go ahead, Maise. What's up?

56
00:05:13,092 --> 00:05:15,053
- [Maise] We need you in the office.

57
00:05:15,054 --> 00:05:16,348
And bring Ashley with you.

58
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,857
- Why don't you call her?

59
00:05:20,858 --> 00:05:22,861
- Mason, it's the worst kept secret

60
00:05:22,862 --> 00:05:24,572
since Jeeves tried to sneak a joint

61
00:05:24,573 --> 00:05:26,243
into the building in 1969.

62
00:05:28,915 --> 00:05:30,585
- It was actually the '70s.

63
00:05:32,213 --> 00:05:33,548
(Noob laughing)

64
00:05:33,549 --> 00:05:36,554
- We're getting a new prisoner
for Ashley to evaluate.

65
00:05:36,555 --> 00:05:38,391
Something about a trial.

66
00:05:38,392 --> 00:05:40,856
They need to know how to
treat his insanity plea.

67
00:05:41,858 --> 00:05:44,112
This demand's coming
straight from the state.

68
00:05:45,824 --> 00:05:47,785
- Your kidding me?

69
00:05:47,786 --> 00:05:50,792
- We don't make the rules,
we just follow them.

70
00:05:52,045 --> 00:05:53,045
- What's the ETA?

71
00:05:53,924 --> 00:05:56,344
- [Maise] The email just
came into the office,

72
00:05:56,345 --> 00:05:57,179
but I think the bus is
already out the front.

73
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,265
- Fuck's sake.

74
00:05:59,685 --> 00:06:00,685
Righto.

75
00:06:01,438 --> 00:06:02,606
- I don't understand.

76
00:06:02,607 --> 00:06:04,819
We're shutting down tomorrow.

77
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,698
I mean, I don't even
have all the resources

78
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,244
to do an accurate evaluation.

79
00:06:14,256 --> 00:06:15,968
- All right, I better go meet them.

80
00:06:19,224 --> 00:06:21,980
(Ashley sighing)

81
00:06:23,065 --> 00:06:24,819
- Love you.
- [Mason] Love you too.

82
00:06:37,552 --> 00:06:39,138
- Who is this guy anyway?

83
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:40,975
Some kind of perv?

84
00:06:40,976 --> 00:06:41,893
- I don't know, eh.

85
00:06:41,894 --> 00:06:43,646
- Probably some psycho
with nothing on his mind

86
00:06:43,647 --> 00:06:45,609
but murder, mayhem.

87
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,947
- Let's keep it professional, shall we?

88
00:06:47,948 --> 00:06:49,074
(bell ringing)

89
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,285
- Well, here he is.

90
00:06:50,286 --> 00:06:51,998
- All right, everyone get ready.

91
00:06:56,298 --> 00:06:57,507
(bell dings)

92
00:06:57,508 --> 00:07:00,514
(suspenseful music)

93
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:11,243
- [Mel] Looks like something

94
00:07:11,244 --> 00:07:12,454
out of a fucking horror movie.

95
00:07:12,455 --> 00:07:14,041
- Time to move, big fella.

96
00:07:14,042 --> 00:07:17,048
(suspenseful music)

97
00:07:20,096 --> 00:07:21,639
(bell ringing)

98
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,017
- [Elevator] Doors closing.

99
00:07:23,018 --> 00:07:26,024
(suspenseful music)

100
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,740
- You mob take him to accommodation.

101
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:31,953
I'll sign the paperwork.

102
00:07:33,664 --> 00:07:34,664
- This way, mate.

103
00:07:37,046 --> 00:07:38,046
You gonna play ball

104
00:07:38,967 --> 00:07:40,385
or do you wanna get dragged?

105
00:07:40,386 --> 00:07:43,392
(suspenseful music)

106
00:07:46,606 --> 00:07:48,234
Play ball.

107
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:49,235
Good choice.

108
00:07:51,658 --> 00:07:53,454
- Hickey, come back.

109
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,335
- And before you ask,

110
00:07:57,336 --> 00:07:59,340
that thing oh his head doesn't come off.

111
00:08:00,176 --> 00:08:01,636
Ever.
- [Mason] Why is that?

112
00:08:02,555 --> 00:08:03,975
- Well, don't ask me, mate.

113
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:06,898
- Run this up to Ashley.

114
00:08:14,621 --> 00:08:17,125
(keys tapping)

115
00:08:17,126 --> 00:08:19,046
(Hickey knocking)

116
00:08:19,047 --> 00:08:19,881
- Come in.

117
00:08:19,882 --> 00:08:21,258
- Anyone home?

118
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:22,259
- Hey.

119
00:08:23,222 --> 00:08:25,058
- Ash, what's going on?

120
00:08:25,059 --> 00:08:26,059
- Nothing.

121
00:08:27,146 --> 00:08:28,231
- Mason got this from the driver.

122
00:08:28,232 --> 00:08:29,066
He asked me to bring it to you.

123
00:08:29,067 --> 00:08:30,276
- Yeah.

124
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:31,446
Thanks, Hickey.

125
00:08:35,746 --> 00:08:36,746
Okay.

126
00:08:39,128 --> 00:08:40,589
What are you doing here then?

127
00:08:48,313 --> 00:08:50,818
(light music)

128
00:08:53,615 --> 00:08:55,159
And the trigger was?

129
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,665
(light music)

130
00:09:04,429 --> 00:09:07,101
(door shutting)

131
00:09:08,645 --> 00:09:10,482
- What's wrong with you?

132
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,621
- Um, this patient that's just come in,

133
00:09:17,622 --> 00:09:18,790
he, um,

134
00:09:21,796 --> 00:09:23,633
he killed five women.

135
00:09:23,634 --> 00:09:25,470
- [Maise] Mm. Yeah.

136
00:09:25,471 --> 00:09:27,976
(light music)

137
00:09:31,232 --> 00:09:32,986
- It just shocked me.

138
00:09:39,874 --> 00:09:40,874
It's fine.

139
00:09:46,638 --> 00:09:49,394
(dramatic music)

140
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,456
- Who's that?

141
00:10:00,457 --> 00:10:03,754
Why has he got that
fucking thing on his head?

142
00:10:03,755 --> 00:10:05,842
Hi, I know something.

143
00:10:05,843 --> 00:10:06,845
I'm not fit.

144
00:10:11,312 --> 00:10:12,731
(Klara laughing)

145
00:10:12,732 --> 00:10:14,235
Come play with me.

146
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,586
You gotta go in.

147
00:10:23,587 --> 00:10:25,674
Won't make no difference.

148
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:34,232
- This will be your new
hotel for the next 10 hours.

149
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,233
Enjoy.

150
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,204
I'm heading back to the camera room.

151
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,963
(door shutting)

152
00:10:50,057 --> 00:10:51,392
- [Elevator] Doors closing.

153
00:10:56,486 --> 00:10:58,573
- [Ashley] Ashley to Mason. Do you copy?

154
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,544
- Yeah, Ashley, go ahead.

155
00:11:05,629 --> 00:11:07,383
- [Ashley] I can't review this guy.

156
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,474
- All right, I'll come up and chat.

157
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,486
(suspenseful music)

158
00:11:50,093 --> 00:11:51,093
Why not?

159
00:11:51,888 --> 00:11:54,184
- I just can't. I can't explain it.

160
00:11:54,185 --> 00:11:56,813
- Can't explain what?

161
00:11:56,814 --> 00:11:58,150
You can't say no. It's your job.

162
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:00,030
- [Mel] The new guy's losing his shit.

163
00:12:02,326 --> 00:12:04,413
- Can someone check on
the new guy, please?

164
00:12:06,751 --> 00:12:08,796
I can't do this right now.

165
00:12:08,797 --> 00:12:09,923
But you should know by now,

166
00:12:09,924 --> 00:12:12,011
you can trust me with anything.

167
00:12:12,888 --> 00:12:14,516
- I do.

168
00:12:14,517 --> 00:12:15,351
- So then do what you're good at

169
00:12:15,352 --> 00:12:18,316
and get it over and done with, okay?

170
00:12:28,169 --> 00:12:30,924
(keypad beeping)

171
00:12:40,944 --> 00:12:42,197
- Hey, you dog.

172
00:12:43,491 --> 00:12:44,660
You all right?

173
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:51,757
(intercom beeping)

174
00:12:51,758 --> 00:12:52,758

(intercom beeping)

178
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,046
- Gotta take a shit. Fuck.

179
00:13:40,856 --> 00:13:43,486
(keys jingling)

180
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:57,931

181
00:13:58,892 --> 00:14:01,146

00:14:01,147 --> 00:14:03,400
No signups, no worries.

183
00:14:03,401 --> 00:14:05,446
Just text and ask to fuck.

00:14:05,447 --> 00:14:07,367
View pictures of horny moms now.

00:15:01,182 --> 00:15:06,192
(fists thudding)
(dramatic music)

190
00:15:37,381 --> 00:15:40,052
(water running)

191
00:16:06,814 --> 00:16:08,525
(suspenseful music)

192
00:16:08,526 --> 00:16:09,526
- Shit.

193
00:16:10,363 --> 00:16:11,990
Attention. Attention.

194
00:16:11,991 --> 00:16:12,825
This is not a drill.

195
00:16:12,826 --> 00:16:14,537
We have a code Black.

196
00:16:14,538 --> 00:16:16,624
The patient is out confinement.

197
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,043
This is not a drill.

198
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:19,672
We have a code Black.

199
00:16:19,673 --> 00:16:21,843
The patient is out of confinement.

200
00:16:21,844 --> 00:16:24,850
(suspenseful music)

201
00:16:43,554 --> 00:16:46,310
(radio thudding)

202
00:16:47,562 --> 00:16:49,482
- [Mason] Team, let's
limit the chat on comms

203
00:16:49,483 --> 00:16:51,402
and prepare for full lockdown.

204
00:16:51,403 --> 00:16:54,409
(suspenseful music)

205
00:17:02,968 --> 00:17:06,057
Mel, green light to
initiate full lockdown.

206
00:17:09,648 --> 00:17:12,404
(alarm beeping)

207
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:33,361
- It's okay. It's okay.

208
00:17:33,362 --> 00:17:34,822
We'll be okay.

209
00:17:34,823 --> 00:17:37,829
(suspenseful music)

210
00:17:51,105 --> 00:17:52,065
(door shutting)

211
00:17:52,066 --> 00:17:53,401
He can't get in.

212
00:17:53,402 --> 00:17:54,319
Look, Andy's locked the door.

213
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,783
We're completely safe.

214
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,790
(suspenseful music)

215
00:18:14,903 --> 00:18:16,824
- Mel, can you see where he is?

216
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:19,159
- Nothing as yet.

217
00:18:20,873 --> 00:18:23,462
Come on, where are you, you ugly bastard?

218
00:18:30,183 --> 00:18:31,478
Should I call the cops?

219
00:18:32,897 --> 00:18:33,897
- Yeah.

220
00:18:34,818 --> 00:18:36,237
Then lock yourself in there.

221
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:44,044
- [Voice On Radio] No orders to him.

222
00:18:44,045 --> 00:18:46,633
No other warnings. No offenses.

223
00:18:48,637 --> 00:18:50,432
Have a look at some emails that were sent

224
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:52,603
for the other member.

225
00:18:52,604 --> 00:18:54,608
- [Dispatcher] Delta 11?

226
00:18:55,943 --> 00:18:57,154
- Delta 11. Go ahead.

227
00:18:58,908 --> 00:19:01,036
- [Dispatcher] Delta 11, we
have a 101 and a possible 104

228
00:19:01,037 --> 00:19:03,458
at the hospital on Blake's Road.

229
00:19:03,459 --> 00:19:04,459
Can you attend?

230
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,801
- Delta 11. Roger that.

231
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,629
- Ashley, Maise, where are you?

232
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:29,552
- [Maise] We're in the
office. Andy's here too.

233
00:19:29,553 --> 00:19:31,055
- I need you here.

234
00:19:33,309 --> 00:19:34,395
Where's Noob?

235
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:39,530
Noob, come in.

236
00:19:39,531 --> 00:19:40,616
You there? Noob?

237
00:19:53,767 --> 00:19:57,900
- Mason, we're gonna stay here.

238
00:19:57,901 --> 00:19:59,863
Everything's locked up. We're safe.

239
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:04,205
(suspenseful music)

240
00:20:06,459 --> 00:20:07,293
(Ashley screaming)

241
00:20:07,294 --> 00:20:08,838
What now.

242
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:09,924
Oh, it's alright.

243
00:20:09,925 --> 00:20:11,969
Back up generator should come on.

244
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,643
(alarm beeping)

245
00:20:19,193 --> 00:20:22,741
- Bet you didn't think this
would happen on your last night.

246
00:20:22,742 --> 00:20:24,035
- It's happening.

247
00:20:24,036 --> 00:20:25,037
We need to come up with a plan.

248
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:26,583
- Or kill him.
- Oh, shut up.

249
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,672
Mase, Klara's still up there.

250
00:20:29,673 --> 00:20:31,383
How do we secure the patient?

251
00:20:31,384 --> 00:20:32,970
- What about the police?

252
00:20:32,971 --> 00:20:34,097
Can we call them?

253
00:20:34,098 --> 00:20:35,349
- [Mason] Mel's onto it.

254
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,938
- Yeah, why can't we just wait for them?

255
00:20:37,939 --> 00:20:39,901
- What do we need the cops for?

256
00:20:42,197 --> 00:20:44,201
- [Mason] Mel, do you have eyes on him?

257
00:20:48,293 --> 00:20:49,293
- Not as yet.

258
00:20:55,307 --> 00:20:56,727
Wait, something's happening.

259
00:21:00,609 --> 00:21:01,609
Mason?

260
00:21:02,572 --> 00:21:03,698
- Yeah.

261
00:21:03,699 --> 00:21:04,699
- We got a problem.

262
00:21:05,953 --> 00:21:06,953
- [Mason] What now?

263
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:10,169
- The screens turned black.

264
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,840
I think he's covered the cameras.

265
00:21:13,051 --> 00:21:15,091
- [Mason] What do you mean
he's covered the cameras?

266
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:18,644
- [Mel] He's covered the fucking cameras.

267
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:19,645
I can't see shit.

268
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:24,866
- How the hell does he
know how to do that?

269
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:29,208
- Well, they always do it in the movies.

270
00:21:30,126 --> 00:21:31,378
- Well, just be glad this isn't

271
00:21:31,379 --> 00:21:33,341
Silence of the Fucking Lambs.

272
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,934
- [Mason] Make your way
down to the team room.

273
00:21:39,395 --> 00:21:40,395
Be careful.

274
00:21:43,194 --> 00:21:44,781
- Okay, I'm coming.

275
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,454
Fuck this shit.

276
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,334
- What the fuck is going on?

277
00:21:51,335 --> 00:21:54,508
(everyone chattering)

278
00:21:59,101 --> 00:22:01,857
- All right, Calm down.

279
00:22:03,568 --> 00:22:05,070
When Mel gets here,

280
00:22:05,071 --> 00:22:07,366
we'll discuss how we're gonna handle him.

281
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,873
(light music)

282
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,471
(door creaking)

283
00:22:22,355 --> 00:22:25,028
(door shutting)

284
00:22:47,614 --> 00:22:50,578
(suspenseful music)

285
00:23:07,863 --> 00:23:10,535
(door creaking)

286
00:23:18,092 --> 00:23:20,805
(Mel yelling)

287
00:23:20,806 --> 00:23:22,727
Get down. Get down now.

288
00:23:23,895 --> 00:23:25,147
- Mel.

289
00:23:25,148 --> 00:23:27,903
(dramatic music)

290
00:23:30,199 --> 00:23:32,662
(Mel gasping)

291
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:36,796
(static)

292
00:23:39,092 --> 00:23:41,848
(dramatic music)

293
00:23:45,396 --> 00:23:46,649
Mel, answer me.

294
00:23:48,277 --> 00:23:50,783
(light music)

295
00:24:02,639 --> 00:24:04,392
- I say we make a run for the exits

296
00:24:04,393 --> 00:24:05,771
and let the cops handle it.

297
00:24:06,981 --> 00:24:09,986
What? I'm retiring tomorrow.

298
00:24:09,987 --> 00:24:11,447
- We've got the manpower.

299
00:24:11,448 --> 00:24:13,118
We can put this guy back in his place.

300
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,454
- All right, cowboy.

301
00:24:15,498 --> 00:24:17,711
What is it that you
think you have to prove?

302
00:24:19,423 --> 00:24:22,010
- Let's find a private little
room and I'll show you.

303
00:24:22,011 --> 00:24:23,388
- Oh, you are so not my type.

304
00:24:23,389 --> 00:24:24,640
- Shut up!

305
00:24:24,641 --> 00:24:27,647
(suspenseful music)

306
00:24:34,035 --> 00:24:36,582
Ashley, you still got
the file there, right?

307
00:24:39,755 --> 00:24:42,259
What does it say? What do we need to know?

308
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,804
- [Ashley] I'll read what it says.

309
00:24:43,805 --> 00:24:46,810
Paul Atkins, convicted for
the murder of five women

310
00:24:46,811 --> 00:24:48,772
pending a mandatory
mental health assessment

311
00:24:48,773 --> 00:24:50,819
by order of the presiding judge.

312
00:24:51,905 --> 00:24:53,406
And it also says here,

313
00:24:53,407 --> 00:24:55,953
he lost his family in a hit and run.

314
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:59,710
(suspenseful music)

315
00:24:59,711 --> 00:25:01,966
- We need to find this guy.

316
00:25:05,014 --> 00:25:07,185
Jeeves, you and Hickey team up.

317
00:25:09,064 --> 00:25:10,817
Fiona, you and Stephanie.

318
00:25:10,818 --> 00:25:12,487
- Really?
- I'll go get Andy.

319
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:14,990
All right.

320
00:25:16,245 --> 00:25:17,454
Let's get it done.

321
00:25:17,455 --> 00:25:20,419
(suspenseful music)

322
00:25:30,941 --> 00:25:32,694
- You got really worked up before.

323
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,037
- I know I'm not supposed to.

324
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:39,038
I just,

325
00:25:40,001 --> 00:25:41,963
I just took it really personally.

326
00:25:45,803 --> 00:25:47,181
- Do you wanna talk about it?

327
00:25:49,728 --> 00:25:50,728
- No.

328
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,776
I mean, maybe one day,

329
00:25:53,777 --> 00:25:57,870
but not here like this.

330
00:25:59,957 --> 00:26:02,836
- Listen, I know that Paul fella's

331
00:26:02,837 --> 00:26:04,884
done some monstrous things,

332
00:26:06,053 --> 00:26:09,433
but I read in his file that
he lost his whole family

333
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:10,853
to a hit-and-run accident.

334
00:26:13,233 --> 00:26:15,029
- Yeah, I, um, I read that too.

335
00:26:16,281 --> 00:26:18,202
- You know, that's how I lost my Howard

336
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:20,498
and my little girl, Sally.

337
00:26:22,627 --> 00:26:23,963
- I'm sorry.

338
00:26:23,964 --> 00:26:28,179
I didn't know.

339
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,267
- Sally didn't die on the road that night.

340
00:26:31,144 --> 00:26:32,521
But that's why I spent

341
00:26:32,522 --> 00:26:34,651
so many years of my life working here.

342
00:26:36,071 --> 00:26:37,115
- I don't understand.

343
00:26:37,992 --> 00:26:42,416
- Well, she had a room here
in this facility for 10 years

344
00:26:42,417 --> 00:26:44,420
before she passed away.

345
00:26:44,421 --> 00:26:47,010
(somber music)

346
00:26:50,099 --> 00:26:51,099
Anyway,

347
00:26:51,936 --> 00:26:52,937
with Andy on the job,

348
00:26:52,938 --> 00:26:54,690
no one's getting through the door.

349
00:26:54,691 --> 00:26:57,947
(Maise and Ashley laughing)

350
00:26:57,948 --> 00:27:00,118
- This is fucking bullshit.

351
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:03,082
Last night on the job, I'm
chasing a fucking fugitive.

352
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:04,001
- Shh.

353
00:27:04,002 --> 00:27:06,756
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

354
00:27:06,757 --> 00:27:11,432
And seriously, I've
worked here all of my life

355
00:27:11,433 --> 00:27:13,102
and I can tell you now,

356
00:27:13,103 --> 00:27:15,565
nothing like this has
ever happened before.

357
00:27:15,566 --> 00:27:16,566
- Did you see that?

358
00:27:18,655 --> 00:27:20,241
- I didn't see anything.

359
00:27:20,242 --> 00:27:21,954
- I saw something. I'm sure of it.

360
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:24,792
Do we radio Mason?

361
00:27:24,793 --> 00:27:27,089
- No. Make too much noise.

362
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,967
And that spithood wanker would hear us.

363
00:27:28,968 --> 00:27:29,968
Come on.

364
00:27:36,316 --> 00:27:38,611
What do you reckon?

365
00:27:38,612 --> 00:27:39,612
Up or down?

366
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:42,409
- Down, I think.

367
00:27:44,457 --> 00:27:45,457
- All right, son.

368
00:27:46,628 --> 00:27:47,713
Lead the way.

369
00:27:49,092 --> 00:27:50,468
- Me?

370
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:52,056
You're the security guy.

371
00:27:54,561 --> 00:27:55,646
- You'll be all right.

372
00:28:07,587 --> 00:28:10,593
(suspenseful music)

373
00:28:17,023 --> 00:28:18,357
(keypad beeping)

374
00:28:18,358 --> 00:28:21,364
(suspenseful music)

375
00:28:27,084 --> 00:28:28,170
- It's empty.

376
00:28:29,505 --> 00:28:32,511
(suspenseful music)

377
00:28:34,641 --> 00:28:36,061
- Hickey! Hickey!

378
00:28:40,778 --> 00:28:43,991
Hickey. Hickey, hang in there, mate.

379
00:28:43,992 --> 00:28:45,703
Don't hurt him, you fucking asshole.

380
00:28:45,704 --> 00:28:46,873
- [Hickey] No.

381
00:28:50,256 --> 00:28:55,266
(fist thudding)
(dramatic music)

382
00:28:58,563 --> 00:29:00,942

(suspenseful music)

384
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,377
- Fuck! Fuck me!

385
00:29:10,629 --> 00:29:11,714
God.

386
00:29:11,715 --> 00:29:12,841
Jesus. God.

387
00:29:12,842 --> 00:29:13,676
Oh, Jesus.

388
00:29:13,677 --> 00:29:15,055
Jesus, come into my life.

389
00:29:16,433 --> 00:29:18,477
Forgive me my sins

390
00:29:18,478 --> 00:29:21,150
and grant me the gift
of eternal salvation.

391
00:29:21,151 --> 00:29:22,151
Amen.

392
00:29:22,987 --> 00:29:25,993
(suspenseful music)

393
00:29:33,633 --> 00:29:36,597
Jesus fucking Christ, I need a joint.

394
00:29:36,598 --> 00:29:38,559
Oh, for fuck's sake.

395
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:43,570
Oh.

396
00:29:44,322 --> 00:29:45,324
Fuck me.

397
00:29:57,807 --> 00:29:59,851
- He's gonna get in here.

398
00:29:59,852 --> 00:30:02,108
- No, that's not gonna happen.

399
00:30:09,497 --> 00:30:10,497
- Maise?

400
00:30:11,418 --> 00:30:16,428
- Mm?

401
00:30:20,769 --> 00:30:21,855
- What would you do

402
00:30:23,065 --> 00:30:25,446
if you found the person
who killed your family?

403
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,954
(light music)

404
00:30:38,138 --> 00:30:41,352
- I hate this place.
It gives me the creeps.

405
00:30:42,646 --> 00:30:44,275
- I'm gonna get a glass of water.

406
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,653
- All this craziness going on

407
00:30:46,654 --> 00:30:48,617
and you wanna get a glass of water?

408
00:31:01,601 --> 00:31:04,063
(water pouring)

409
00:31:04,064 --> 00:31:07,070
(suspenseful music)

410
00:31:20,556 --> 00:31:23,143
(wall banging)

411
00:31:33,915 --> 00:31:36,504
(pan crashing)

412
00:31:40,345 --> 00:31:41,597
Fiona?

413
00:31:41,598 --> 00:31:44,604
(suspenseful music)

414
00:31:50,156 --> 00:31:52,410
(Fiona screaming)
Oh my God.

415
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:53,704
Seriously?

416
00:31:53,705 --> 00:31:54,957
- Got you good, didn't I?

417
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,970
- That's not funny.

418
00:32:01,971 --> 00:32:03,266
- It's a little bit funny.

419
00:32:08,443 --> 00:32:11,449
(suspenseful music)

420
00:32:15,999 --> 00:32:18,211

422
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:22,346
(suspenseful music)

423
00:32:48,815 --> 00:32:52,656
(suspenseful music continues)

424
00:32:58,293 --> 00:33:01,131
(Fiona screaming)

425
00:33:02,968 --> 00:33:04,136
- Help me!

426
00:33:04,137 --> 00:33:07,143
(suspenseful music)

427
00:33:21,254 --> 00:33:22,214
(door banging)

428
00:33:22,215 --> 00:33:25,221
(suspenseful music)

429
00:33:35,241 --> 00:33:38,372
(lid banging)

430
00:33:38,373 --> 00:33:40,876
(garbage banging)

431
00:33:40,877 --> 00:33:43,883
(suspenseful music)

432
00:34:10,645 --> 00:34:14,486

433
00:34:16,323 --> 00:34:19,244

(Fiona screaming)

435
00:34:33,983 --> 00:34:36,739

00:34:49,473 --> 00:34:51,308
(phone buzzing)

437
00:34:51,309 --> 00:34:53,605
- Is that little Johnny, is it?

438
00:34:53,606 --> 00:34:54,983
- It's John. You know he hates that.

439
00:34:54,984 --> 00:34:59,909
- Oh, I know he hates it.
That's what I call him it.

440
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:01,203
He's a bit of a dickhead.

441
00:35:01,204 --> 00:35:04,585
- You're a bit of a dickhead.
- He's a fucking dickhead.

442
00:35:04,586 --> 00:35:06,464
- [Radio] Address on Old County Road.

443
00:35:06,465 --> 00:35:09,386
- I just don't think he treats you well.

444
00:35:09,387 --> 00:35:10,890
- He's not so bad.

445
00:35:12,978 --> 00:35:17,654
(person on radio speaking indistinctly)

446
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:19,907
- Let's go check this out, eh?

447
00:35:19,908 --> 00:35:21,201
- [Radio] Zero, three, six,

448
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:24,083
four, seven, one, four, four, four.

449
00:35:26,505 --> 00:35:28,759
(car doors shutting)

450
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:33,436
(person on radio speaking indistinctly)

451
00:35:37,944 --> 00:35:40,450
(dog barking)

452
00:35:42,829 --> 00:35:44,081
- [Radio] Yeah, roger that.

453
00:35:44,082 --> 00:35:48,758
(person on radio speaking indistinctly)

454
00:35:51,179 --> 00:35:53,391
- Thought this place was a hospital.

455
00:36:01,074 --> 00:36:03,369
(dog barking)

456
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,706
- Can't see any lights on.

457
00:36:07,086 --> 00:36:08,213
- There's nothing here.

458
00:36:10,008 --> 00:36:11,595
- [Officer] It's all boarded up.

459
00:36:13,641 --> 00:36:15,268
- Wanna call it in?

460
00:36:15,269 --> 00:36:16,269
- Yep.

461
00:36:17,816 --> 00:36:19,067
Delta 11.

462
00:36:19,068 --> 00:36:21,321
- [Dispatcher] Delta 11. Go ahead.

463
00:36:21,322 --> 00:36:22,825
- Delta 11. We don't see anything here.

464
00:36:22,826 --> 00:36:25,454
So we're gonna resume patrols.

465
00:36:25,455 --> 00:36:27,251
- [Dispatcher] Roger that, Delta 11.

466
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,269
(car doors shutting)

467
00:36:40,152 --> 00:36:43,158
(suspenseful music)

468
00:37:10,087 --> 00:37:13,886
(suspenseful music continues)

469
00:37:19,063 --> 00:37:20,063
- Ashley.

470
00:37:20,817 --> 00:37:22,151
(door slamming)
Ashley.

471
00:37:22,152 --> 00:37:23,488
Ashley, wake up.

472
00:37:32,006 --> 00:37:34,093
- I just had a bad dream.

473
00:37:37,141 --> 00:37:38,476
I couldn't move.

474
00:37:41,316 --> 00:37:42,318
It was him.

475
00:37:44,447 --> 00:37:45,991
- You were screaming and sweating.

476
00:37:45,992 --> 00:37:47,036
I had to wake you up.

477
00:38:07,117 --> 00:38:08,870
- [Ashley] Maise.

478
00:38:08,871 --> 00:38:09,871
- Yeah?

479
00:38:11,501 --> 00:38:13,338
- [Ashley] You didn't answer me before.

480
00:38:14,465 --> 00:38:15,802
- [Maise] When was that, love?

481
00:38:18,139 --> 00:38:19,224
- I asked you what you would do

482
00:38:19,225 --> 00:38:21,897
if you found the person
who killed your family.

483
00:38:26,949 --> 00:38:29,202
- Well, I'd want justice.

484
00:38:29,203 --> 00:38:32,209
(suspenseful music)

485
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,888
I'd fucking kill him.

486
00:38:38,889 --> 00:38:41,895
(suspenseful music)

487
00:38:45,152 --> 00:38:47,824
(phone ringing)

488
00:38:51,164 --> 00:38:54,127
(phone ringing)

489
00:38:54,128 --> 00:38:59,138
(phone ringing)
(suspenseful music)

490
00:39:25,524 --> 00:39:27,652
(door shutting)

491
00:39:27,653 --> 00:39:28,988
- Why haven't the cops shown up yet?

492
00:39:28,989 --> 00:39:30,116
- I don't know.

493
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:33,580
But we need to get back upstairs.

494
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:34,708
- What about Stephanie?

495
00:39:34,709 --> 00:39:35,836
She was with Fiona.

496
00:39:38,258 --> 00:39:39,301
- Stephanie, come in.

497
00:39:42,767 --> 00:39:44,602
Stephanie, you there?

498
00:39:44,603 --> 00:39:46,983
- It's not like her not
to respond straight away.

499
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:48,236
- Radio silence.

500
00:39:49,113 --> 00:39:50,447
Look, we should check on Klara.

501
00:39:50,448 --> 00:39:53,078
We've still got a duty to care to her.

502
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:54,539
- You guys check on Klara.

503
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,374
Meet me back at the office.

504
00:39:55,375 --> 00:39:57,295
- I don't reckon we should split up, Mase.

505
00:39:57,296 --> 00:39:58,296
Mase.

506
00:40:00,845 --> 00:40:03,516
(door shutting)

507
00:40:04,853 --> 00:40:06,438
What are you doing?

508
00:40:06,439 --> 00:40:08,026
- Just some rubbish, that's all.

509
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:18,755
(keypad beeping)

510
00:40:18,756 --> 00:40:21,509
- Klara, you all right, love?

511
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:23,597
- It's gray's birthday.

512
00:40:23,598 --> 00:40:25,517
- Let's get her back to the office.

513
00:40:25,518 --> 00:40:26,518
- Yeah.

514
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,317
Just get your, your shoes on.

515
00:40:29,318 --> 00:40:32,866
Why don't you get them on?
(suspenseful music)

516
00:40:32,867 --> 00:40:35,496
(door slamming)

517
00:40:35,497 --> 00:40:37,124
Andy, what are you doing, mate?

518
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:40,965
(suspenseful music)

519
00:40:40,966 --> 00:40:42,510
Andy, get back in here now.

520
00:40:42,511 --> 00:40:43,511
Andy. Andy.

521
00:40:44,264 --> 00:40:46,226
Andy, get back in here.

522
00:40:46,227 --> 00:40:49,482
Andy.
(door banging)

523
00:40:49,483 --> 00:40:51,987
Leave him alone, you fucking bastard.

524
00:40:51,988 --> 00:40:53,074
Fucking hell.

525
00:40:56,414 --> 00:40:58,250
You bastard.

526
00:40:58,251 --> 00:40:59,711
Shit.

527
00:40:59,712 --> 00:41:02,384
(Andy thudding)

528
00:41:03,887 --> 00:41:05,557
You fucking bastard.

529
00:41:13,614 --> 00:41:15,159
(door banging)
- [Mason] Ash. Ashley.

530
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,160
- Mason?

531
00:41:17,456 --> 00:41:18,456
- Help me, Ash.

532
00:41:25,513 --> 00:41:27,141
- We haven't caught him yet.

533
00:41:27,142 --> 00:41:28,602
- Are you saying he's still out there?

534
00:41:28,603 --> 00:41:30,647
- [Mason] Yeah.
- What about the cops?

535
00:41:30,648 --> 00:41:31,775
- Mel rang them, but they didn't rock up.

536
00:41:31,776 --> 00:41:34,113
- Well, fucking ring them again.

537
00:41:34,114 --> 00:41:35,616
- Doesn't matter anyway.

538
00:41:35,617 --> 00:41:36,659
This place is built to ensure

539
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,330
that if a lockdown comes into effect,

540
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:39,749
no one can get out, meaning

541
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,628
- No one can get in. Fuck.

542
00:41:41,629 --> 00:41:45,093
- They probably came and left,
thought the place was closed.

543
00:41:45,094 --> 00:41:46,471
- My daughter died in this place.

544
00:41:46,472 --> 00:41:48,142
I never thought I'd die here too.

545
00:41:49,436 --> 00:41:50,604
- Andy, Jeeves.

546
00:41:50,605 --> 00:41:51,605
Jeeves, you there?

547
00:41:56,325 --> 00:41:57,785
Jeeves, you there?

548
00:41:57,786 --> 00:41:59,080
- Okay, man. Yeah, yeah.

549
00:41:59,081 --> 00:42:00,165
I'm here, Mason.

550
00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:02,337
- Can you and Andy come
down to the office?

551
00:42:05,635 --> 00:42:06,469
- Sorry, mate.

552
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:08,015
I can't do that right now.

553
00:42:08,892 --> 00:42:10,979
- Are you okay? What's happened?

554
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:11,980
- No, mate.

555
00:42:13,276 --> 00:42:14,444
Andy's dead.

556
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,327
Look, I'm,

557
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:21,416
I'm stuck in confinement.

558
00:42:21,417 --> 00:42:24,298
Can you get Ashley to
release cell door two?

559
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,470
- [Mason] Yeah, copy that.

560
00:42:29,766 --> 00:42:30,766
Where's Klara?

561
00:42:32,314 --> 00:42:33,441
- I'm here.
- No.

562
00:42:36,948 --> 00:42:39,369
She's here, mate. She's here.

563
00:42:40,413 --> 00:42:42,124
I'll tell you what.

564
00:42:42,125 --> 00:42:45,756
If she wasn't crazy
before, she fucking is now.

565
00:42:45,757 --> 00:42:48,512
(Klara laughing)

566
00:43:12,102 --> 00:43:17,112
(keypad beeping)
(Klara laughing)

567
00:43:19,658 --> 00:43:21,120
- Maybe we just wait him out.

568
00:43:22,205 --> 00:43:23,332
- It's not that simple.

569
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:26,255
- What the hell does that mean?

570
00:43:28,843 --> 00:43:31,806
- In his file, you said
his family was killed.

571
00:43:31,807 --> 00:43:34,062
- Yeah, hit-and-run. Left them for dead.

572
00:43:36,817 --> 00:43:38,778
- What if the driver didn't?

573
00:43:38,779 --> 00:43:40,366
- Didn't what?
- Drive off.

574
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,494
- What?

575
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:45,293
- What if the driver stopped
first and then drove off?

576
00:43:46,462 --> 00:43:49,341
Something or someone in
here has triggered him.

577
00:43:49,342 --> 00:43:51,847
(light music)

578
00:43:57,776 --> 00:43:59,112
- Okay, so what now?

579
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:02,869
- I have an idea.

580
00:44:08,506 --> 00:44:09,506
Paul.

581
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,762
Paul Atkins.

582
00:44:14,226 --> 00:44:15,979
I know you can't respond,

583
00:44:21,782 --> 00:44:23,494
but I also know you can hear me.

584
00:44:25,498 --> 00:44:27,918
I'm sorry for what
happened to your family.

585
00:44:27,919 --> 00:44:29,380
I really am.

586
00:44:29,381 --> 00:44:30,967
But all I wanna do is talk.

587
00:44:33,931 --> 00:44:36,103
I'm not going to hurt you.

588
00:44:38,607 --> 00:44:40,026
You have my word.

589
00:44:40,027 --> 00:44:41,195
You can trust me.

590
00:44:41,196 --> 00:44:43,701
(light music)

591
00:44:54,347 --> 00:44:56,935
(somber music)

592
00:45:21,193 --> 00:45:24,199
(suspenseful music)

593
00:45:26,787 --> 00:45:28,790
- [Maise] Mason, you got him trapped yet?

594
00:45:28,791 --> 00:45:31,797
(suspenseful music)

595
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:43,736
- Maise, Ashley, are you there?

596
00:45:43,737 --> 00:45:46,743
(suspenseful music)

597
00:46:13,547 --> 00:46:17,388
(suspenseful music continues)

598
00:47:00,474 --> 00:47:03,647
- I was the one who killed his family.

599
00:47:06,361 --> 00:47:08,365
- I, I don't understand.

600
00:47:12,206 --> 00:47:14,501
- I was driving the car that day.

601
00:47:14,502 --> 00:47:17,090
(somber music)

602
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:23,728
- Are you telling me all
of this is because of you?

603
00:47:23,729 --> 00:47:24,688
- [Ashley] I'm so sorry.
- Is, is that

604
00:47:24,689 --> 00:47:26,443
what you're telling me?
- I'm so sorry.

605
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:30,534
- Oh, Jesus Christ, Ashley.

606
00:47:31,995 --> 00:47:33,248
- I'm so sorry.

607
00:47:34,834 --> 00:47:37,548
- [Maise] None of them had to die, Ashley.

608
00:47:39,469 --> 00:47:43,351
- Maise, I'm so sorry. None of
this was supposed to happen.

609
00:47:43,352 --> 00:47:45,940
(somber music)

610
00:48:03,725 --> 00:48:05,144
I'm sorry, Maise.

611
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:07,942
- Just stop.

612
00:48:08,777 --> 00:48:10,071
Stop talking.

613
00:48:11,449 --> 00:48:13,076
Oh.

614
00:48:13,077 --> 00:48:15,666
(somber music)

615
00:48:28,358 --> 00:48:30,445
Well, I don't know how
you're gonna sleep at night.

616
00:48:30,446 --> 00:48:32,741
- Oh, Maise.

617
00:48:32,742 --> 00:48:34,118
- Don't, don't, don't.

618
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:35,119
Just

619
00:48:37,042 --> 00:48:37,876
- It wasn't supposed to happen.

620
00:48:37,877 --> 00:48:38,711
- Jesus, I never would've,

621
00:48:38,712 --> 00:48:39,714
I know I, just don't.

622
00:48:42,803 --> 00:48:43,929
- It didn't
- Op.

623
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:46,478
(somber music)

624
00:48:54,034 --> 00:48:55,287
How pathetic.

625
00:48:56,373 --> 00:48:58,124
- [Ashley] Please don't tell.
- Pathetic.

626
00:48:58,125 --> 00:49:01,633
- [Ashley] Please, just don't tell anyone.

627
00:49:03,345 --> 00:49:06,058
- You're asking me to keep
your filthy little secret?

628
00:49:07,645 --> 00:49:08,645
I don't think so.

629
00:49:09,774 --> 00:49:11,277
You're gonna pay for this.

630
00:49:12,195 --> 00:49:13,657
For every single one of them.

631
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:15,952
Do you hear me?

632
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,664
Every single one of them.

633
00:49:17,665 --> 00:49:20,253
(somber music)

634
00:49:24,345 --> 00:49:25,345
- I'm sorry.

635
00:49:30,064 --> 00:49:32,026
- It's not me you have to apologize to.

636
00:49:35,116 --> 00:49:36,994
It's all their families.

637
00:49:36,995 --> 00:49:38,498
You've gotta go and tell them.

638
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:43,048
You're a coward, Ashley.

639
00:49:53,487 --> 00:49:55,197
- I'm sorry.

640
00:49:55,198 --> 00:49:56,115
(bell ringing)

641
00:49:56,116 --> 00:49:58,538
(bell dings)

642
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:03,673
(suspenseful music)

643
00:50:06,679 --> 00:50:09,519
(Jeeves groaning)

644
00:50:36,781 --> 00:50:39,620
(Jeeves groaning)

645
00:50:44,422 --> 00:50:46,257
(bottle thudding)

646
00:50:46,258 --> 00:50:49,222
(suspenseful music)

647
00:50:57,615 --> 00:51:00,077
(light music)

648
00:51:27,508 --> 00:51:30,847
(light music continues)

649
00:51:57,484 --> 00:52:00,824
(light music continues)

650
00:52:04,498 --> 00:52:06,919
- [Mason] Maise, do you copy?

651
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,926
- We're here, Mason. I
need to tell you something.

652
00:52:10,927 --> 00:52:12,472
- What? You can't tell him.

653
00:52:12,473 --> 00:52:14,183
- [Mason] I need you to
take us outta lockdown.

654
00:52:14,184 --> 00:52:16,773
And when I say, lock it back down again.

655
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:18,900
- It's my job.

656
00:52:20,154 --> 00:52:22,408
- You tell him or I will.

657
00:52:27,753 --> 00:52:28,754
I'll be right back.

658
00:52:28,755 --> 00:52:30,674
- Maise.

659
00:52:30,675 --> 00:52:33,055
I have a really bad feeling about this.

660
00:52:34,349 --> 00:52:35,434
- I'm going.

661
00:52:37,523 --> 00:52:40,529
(suspenseful music)

662
00:53:05,745 --> 00:53:08,082
- Maise, lock it down now.

663
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:09,836
(alarm beeping)

664
00:53:09,837 --> 00:53:10,796
(door shutting)

665
00:53:10,797 --> 00:53:13,468
(alarm beeping)

666
00:53:16,183 --> 00:53:21,151
- Ashley?

667
00:53:21,736 --> 00:53:22,904
Ashley?

668
00:53:22,905 --> 00:53:25,409
(light music)

669
00:53:42,861 --> 00:53:44,322
- Ashley, what are you doing?

670
00:53:48,121 --> 00:53:49,999
- His wife's name was Sarah.

671
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,589
(somber music)

672
00:53:57,473 --> 00:53:58,473
It was me.

673
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:00,855
I'm the driver.

674
00:54:02,693 --> 00:54:04,195
I love you, Mason.

675
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:07,576
Stop. Stop.

676
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,580
Stop, Mason, stop.

677
00:54:09,581 --> 00:54:11,333
Mason, no, no, no.

678
00:54:11,334 --> 00:54:13,212
Mason! Mason!

679
00:54:13,213 --> 00:54:14,213
Mason, no.

680
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:16,721
Mason, Mason, Mason.

681
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:19,182
Please.

682
00:54:19,183 --> 00:54:22,188
(soft music)

683
00:54:22,189 --> 00:54:24,027
No, no, no, not Mason.

684
00:54:27,993 --> 00:54:29,747
Mason, stop. Wake up!

685
00:54:31,207 --> 00:54:33,252
Please. (cries)

686
00:54:33,253 --> 00:54:35,633
(soft music)

687
00:54:55,506 --> 00:54:58,178
(door clanging)

688
00:55:14,043 --> 00:55:16,464
(soft music)

689
00:55:18,636 --> 00:55:19,636
- See?

690
00:55:20,514 --> 00:55:22,769
I told you I'd get it done.

691
00:55:24,522 --> 00:55:27,569
(dramatic music)

692
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:28,570
Hey.

693
00:55:34,417 --> 00:55:35,626
I'll take care of those.

694
00:55:35,627 --> 00:55:38,383
(dramatic music)

695
00:55:43,602 --> 00:55:48,612
(sirens blaring)
(dramatic music)

696
00:56:01,095 --> 00:56:03,851
(sirens blaring)

697
00:56:16,376 --> 00:56:19,382
(suspenseful music)

698
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:50,277
(suspenseful music continues)

699
00:57:16,496 --> 00:57:20,337
(suspenseful music continues)

700
00:57:46,514 --> 00:57:50,313
(suspenseful music continues)

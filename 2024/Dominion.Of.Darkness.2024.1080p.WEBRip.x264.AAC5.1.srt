00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:57,041
OF THE CASES OF POSSESSION
IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH,

4
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:59,916
90% ARE RELATED TO MEDICAL CONDITIONS
OR MENTAL ILLNESSES

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,791
ONLY 10% OF THEM NEED AN EXORCISM.
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE CASES.

6
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:14,583
BASED ON A REAL STORY
OF EXORCISM IN INDONESIA

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,625
Help!

8
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,916
Help!

9
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:53,041
Thomas…

10
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:57,250
Thomas!

11
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,416
Di! Di!

12
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:03,625
Di!

13
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,083
Hush now.

14
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:12,375
Di. Di!

15
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,000
Di. Di.

16
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,000
Di. Di…

17
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,666
Ma!

18
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,625
Help…

19
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,083
Help!

20
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,333
I'm scared.

21
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:28,333
I'm here, Di. I'm here.

22
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:30,375
- Thomas…
- Di. Di.

23
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:32,875
- I'm scared, Thomas.
- I know.

24
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:38,583
Please pray for me, Thomas.

25
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,208
- I'll pray for you, okay?
- Mm.

26
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:46,250
Dear Lord,
please help my sister.

27
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,000
We believe in Your wounds.

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,208
We need Your miracle.

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,708
Dear Lord, please have mercy on us.

30
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:58,666
Di?

31
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,333
Di?

32
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:01,833
Di…

33
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:03,333
Di!

34
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,666
Di!

35
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,458
"JESUS CALLED HIS TWELVE DISCIPLES

36
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:24,583
AND GAVE THEM AUTHORITY

00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:27,000
AND TO WIPE AWAY
EVERY DISEASE AND WEAKNESS."

REST IN PEACE
DIANDRA VALENCIA, DIANA DOROTHY

41
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:36,875
{\an8}- Excuse me, sir.
Yes?

42
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,000
{\an8}Please take it.

43
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,625
{\an8}- Thank you, Father.
You're welcome.

44
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,208
- Good morning.
- Father.

45
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,416
- Good morning.
- Father.

46
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:16,958
Ah.

47
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:22,208
Sorry to keep you waiting.
What's wrong, Thomas?

48
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:23,958
You know why I'm here.

49
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,166
- Oh.
- I wish to resign, Father.

50
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:27,833
Thomas.

51
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:32,500
Have you considered this carefully?

52
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,500
How about giving it some more thought?

53
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,916
I've made up my mind.

54
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,166
The service will start shortly.

55
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,333
We'll talk more about this later.

56
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,666
- Father, please!
- Okay, all right.

57
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,125
I can only stay
until the end of the semester.

58
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:29,500
I'M IN A MEETING.
WHERE SHOULD I PICK YOU UP?

59
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,958
Maya?

60
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:01,250
- Are you okay?
- It's Kayla.

61
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,333
She said she was coming to church,

62
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:06,083
but the service is over
and she's not here.

63
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,208
She's not picking up her phone.

64
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:10,541
Where is she?

65
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:14,291
Maybe with her friend.
Teenagers, you know?

66
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,250
- You're right.
- Don't worry.

67
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:23,041
Would you please talk to her?

68
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,166
Okay.

69
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,708
I'll try to,

70
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,666
even though she hates me.

71
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,916
You're ignoring
your food and your phone.

72
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,750
Poor thing. Please, be strong.

73
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:50,125
That's just how girls are.
They act like they don't need you.

74
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,916
- Whatever.
- Your mom is calling.

75
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,125
- Hey. Hey.
- Mm?

76
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,416
Just relax, okay?

77
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,708
I don't give up easily.

78
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:07,041
I'll try talking to Kayla.

79
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:11,541
Daughter to future stepdad.

80
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:16,750
I appreciate it.

81
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:21,416
Let me try once more.
She might pick up.

82
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,250
I hope so.

83
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:26,500
Just pick up.
It could be important, Kay.

84
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,083
They're probably just wondering
why I missed the service.

85
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:31,291
Oh.

86
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,041
I get it.

87
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:36,125
You don't want to meet
your mom's boyfriend.

88
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,125
Let's just drop it.

89
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,333
- Did she pick up?
- No.

90
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,416
She didn't.

91
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,000
For you.

92
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,541
- Can't you just talk to her?
- No use.

93
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,083
She won't listen to me.

94
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:08,791
I've told her that he is unfaithful.

95
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,458
He's got girls everywhere.

96
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,083
But she didn't believe me.

97
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:17,083
Yeah, I get it.

98
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:22,000
That's how my dad was too.
Luckily, they got divorced.

99
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,625
There's an upside, though.
The money is all mine.

100
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:29,166
Those homewreckers won't get any.

101
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:36,833
I miss Papa.

102
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,500
If he were alive,

103
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,125
Mama would've listened to him.

104
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,166
Only him.

105
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,416
I have an idea!

106
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,416
My dad has passed away.
How can I ask for his help?

107
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,041
We summon his spirit.

108
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,333
- You're a freak.
- True.

109
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:11,000
It's okay if you don't want to.

110
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:14,083
We can find another way
that's more appropriate.

111
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,958
Maybe…

112
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,666
we could secretly stalk Denis
until we get proof that he's cheating.

113
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,125
KAYLA, DENIS PROPOSED TO ME.
PLEASE COME HOME SOON.

114
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:25,458
Then, we'll show your mom the evidence
so she'll believe us.

115
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,291
Perhaps…

116
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,458
if you still want to use
a mystical approach,

117
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:33,166
graveyard soil will do.

118
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,458
You know how to do it?

119
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:37,333
Which one? Stalking or…?

120
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,625
Summoning my father.

121
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,458
Yes, I do.

122
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,083
Come on, relax.

123
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:45,750
Trust me.

124
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:49,041
You want to save your mom
from that jerk, right?

125
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,083
Ready, Kayla?

126
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,833
Are you sure it's safe?

127
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,500
It should be.

128
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,625
What if it's another spirit that comes?

129
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:36,083
This is your dad's grave.
Of course it'll be him.

130
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,583
Unless we get the wrong grave.

131
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,208
- Ouch! That hurts!
- Please be serious!

132
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,166
Why are you so tense? Come on.

133
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,625
- Cilla.
- Yes?

134
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,375
Are you sure?

135
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:01,750
Definitely.

136
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,541
Are you scared?

137
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,125
No.

138
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,041
I'm not scared at all.

139
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,583
Actually, I'm scared.

140
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,250
But we're here anyway.

141
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:16,458
Should we come back tomorrow at noon?

142
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,000
We can't.

143
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,541
Too many people.

144
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,375
They'd kick us out.

145
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,375
Some aunties might record us.

146
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,541
That happened to me once.

147
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,541
- People are…
- Cilla.

148
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,083
That's my dad's grave.

149
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,416
Be careful.

150
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,708
- This one?
- Yes.

151
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,916
Come on.

152
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,000
Let's say the chant together.

153
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:16,291
<i>Jelangkung, jelangse.</i>
We have a small party.

154
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:19,416
Come uninvited.
Leave on your own.

155
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,541
Seriously, Kayla?

156
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:28,250
Your dad won't understand if you mumble.

157
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,791
Even his spirit will be confused.

158
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,500
Try it again.

159
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,291
Okay.

160
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:40,083
<i>Jelangkung, jelangse.</i>
We have a small party.

161
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:43,208
Come uninvited.
Leave on your own.

162
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,541
- Kay!
- Cilla!

163
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,333
Quick, Kayla. What do you want?

164
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,750
Which one is Kayla?

165
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:10,791
Papa.

166
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:15,458
Pa,

167
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:19,333
please keep Mama away from that awful guy.

168
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,166
Hey, what are you doing here?

169
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,416
My friend misses her dad.

170
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,625
We're heading home. The reunion is over.

171
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,875
We're heading home now, sir. Bye.

172
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,291
Now what, Cilla?

173
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,541
We just wait and see.

174
00:14:56,875 --> 00:15:01,208
Relax. Your dad was a kind man.
He will definitely help you.

175
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:17,333
Let's go home, or we'll get in trouble.

176
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,708
Just got home, Kayla?

177
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,583
DENIS, YOU JERK! YOU'D BETTER DIE!

178
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,083
Who is she?

179
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,500
So, my friend was lying?

180
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:44,291
Back then, you said Kayla was lying.

181
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:47,375
I'm starting to think
maybe there is another woman.

182
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:50,958
Let's just break up!
Forget about the wedding!

183
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:56,916
Thank you, Papa.

184
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,833
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Father.

185
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,458
Good morning, Father.

186
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:49,833
Father.

187
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:53,958
I'm sure

188
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,958
that Diandra would be happy in heaven
to see you smile.

189
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,250
Cilla, it worked!

190
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,291
Hey, are you sick?

191
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:28,916
No.

192
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:36,666
What's wrong with your neck?

193
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,666
I'm not sure.
It's felt heavy since last night.

194
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,458
I'll take you to the infirmary.

195
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:44,958
Don't worry about it.

196
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,000
Good morning, class.

197
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,250
Good morning, Father.

198
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:59,750
Before we begin,
who'd like to lead the prayer?

199
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,166
- Yohannes?
- Yes, Father.

200
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,625
Please come forward.

201
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:26,625
Hi, Kay. You're home.

202
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,916
Have something to eat.

203
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:41,625
Maybe she's tired.

204
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,166
Papa.

205
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:02,583
Why is Mama still with that guy?

206
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:14,041
Please keep them apart.

207
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:17,958
I don't want anything to happen to Mama.

208
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,875
Kayla?

209
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,541
You're all sinners.

210
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,916
- You're all sinners.
- Kayla?

211
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,958
- You're all sinners.
- What happened, Kay?

212
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:31,125
- You're all sinners.
- Kayla? Kayla, stop!

213
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:34,333
What's wrong, Kay?

214
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,333
Please, wake up, Kay.

215
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:38,291
Kayla?

216
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:40,208
You're all sinners.

217
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:42,666
You're all sinners.

218
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:45,041
- Kayla! Wake up!
- You're all sinners.

219
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:47,208
Stop it!

220
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,666
Are you okay, Kayla?

221
00:25:33,916 --> 00:25:35,625
Are you okay, Kayla?

222
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:50,125
I'm fine, Ma.

223
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:15,875
<i>Die.</i>

224
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:18,125
<i>Die.</i>

225
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:21,541
<i>Die. Die. Die.</i>

226
00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:24,458
<i>Die. Die.</i>

227
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:27,416
<i>Die. Die.</i>

228
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:06,083
Good morning, class.

229
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,708
Good morning, Father.

230
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:16,750
It is with great sadness
I have to share this bad news.

231
00:27:17,458 --> 00:27:19,291
One of your friends,

232
00:27:20,458 --> 00:27:22,375
Priscilla, passed away last night.

233
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Her remains will be buried tonight.

234
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,083
Please pray for her.

235
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,875
Kayla.

236
00:27:35,916 --> 00:27:38,375
Kayla. He's calling for you.

237
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:41,125
Kayla, please come with me.

238
00:27:42,291 --> 00:27:44,500
We know this must be hard.

239
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:47,000
You might still be in shock.

240
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,291
But we need to know,

241
00:27:51,208 --> 00:27:53,833
did Cilla ever talk to you
or act strangely?

242
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:03,458
I have no idea, Father.

243
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:07,166
She just said that her shoulder hurt.

244
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,625
What happened to Cilla?

245
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:22,333
She's not really dead, is she?

246
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:27,375
Cilla!

247
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:50,166
If you know anything,

248
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:53,625
you need to tell the school board

249
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,458
so we can investigate.

250
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,166
Kayla?

251
00:29:25,791 --> 00:29:27,166
What's wrong with you?

252
00:29:33,583 --> 00:29:34,875
What's wrong, Kayla?

253
00:29:35,916 --> 00:29:36,916
Hey.

254
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:38,666
Kay.

255
00:29:39,708 --> 00:29:40,875
What's wrong with you?

256
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:45,416
Kayla?

257
00:29:47,583 --> 00:29:48,625
Kay!

258
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,625
Kayla!

259
00:29:54,541 --> 00:29:56,791
Kayla, what's wrong?

260
00:29:57,791 --> 00:29:59,833
- Kayla!
- You're a hypocrite!

261
00:29:59,916 --> 00:30:04,125
You think your God can save this child?

262
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:15,375
Hey.

263
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:18,625
Kay? Kay?

264
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:21,250
Kay? Kayla!

265
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:22,583
Sister, please help.

266
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:38,875
How's Kayla doing?

267
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,041
Still unconscious, Father.

268
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:47,583
How did they end up like that?

269
00:30:48,666 --> 00:30:49,958
I have no idea.

270
00:30:52,041 --> 00:30:55,375
But… from the words she said

271
00:30:56,458 --> 00:30:58,208
and the language she used,

272
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:01,666
this could be really serious.

273
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,750
I heard her talking in Latin.

274
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:05,208
Hmm.

275
00:31:07,958 --> 00:31:09,875
Judging by your explanation,

276
00:31:11,708 --> 00:31:15,083
Kayla's condition is not a medical

277
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,250
or mental issue.

278
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,750
This is the dominion of darkness.

279
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:23,000
It's demonic.

280
00:31:25,875 --> 00:31:27,625
There's a priest

281
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:30,041
who can help us with this problem.

282
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,625
- Stop it! It hurts!
- Albert!

283
00:31:35,708 --> 00:31:37,541
Fight it, Bert!

284
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:40,583
Fight it!

285
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:49,041
How could a child let his mother
die alone in the nursing home?

286
00:32:16,708 --> 00:32:19,208
Michael, this is Mama.

287
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:21,958
Why did you leave me alone?

288
00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:24,166
You're not my mother!

289
00:32:33,291 --> 00:32:36,000
In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.

290
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,833
I command you to leave!

291
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:40,958
You have no power over Albert's body!

292
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:43,708
You have control over this body, Lord.

293
00:32:43,791 --> 00:32:47,375
There is no power greater
than the power of Your blood.

294
00:32:47,916 --> 00:32:51,708
In the name of Christ,
I command you to leave!

295
00:32:52,291 --> 00:32:55,291
Michael, please don't hurt your mama.

296
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:57,791
Hold him down!

297
00:32:57,875 --> 00:33:02,541
I, a servant of the Lord,
am given authority by the Holy Trinity

298
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:05,333
to cast you out, unclean spirit!

299
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:08,875
I command you to leave Albert!

300
00:33:09,833 --> 00:33:12,541
Reveal your name!

301
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:16,000
Reveal your name, demon!

302
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:20,250
Kadastor!

303
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,958
In the name of Jesus Christ,

304
00:33:24,041 --> 00:33:28,708
I command you, Kadastor,
to leave this child!

305
00:33:28,791 --> 00:33:32,916
Leave and yield under the feet of Christ!

306
00:33:57,958 --> 00:33:59,041
Father.

307
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:01,541
Forgive me.

308
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,458
I can't continue this task anymore.

309
00:34:07,916 --> 00:34:09,958
I'm too consumed with guilt.

310
00:34:11,458 --> 00:34:13,708
The demons can see it
and it's hard for me.

311
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:20,375
Michael, they are playing with your mind.

312
00:34:21,208 --> 00:34:23,041
Don't let them win.

313
00:34:23,125 --> 00:34:27,250
As long as you admit your sins,
Satan can't attack you.

314
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:30,875
Forgive me, Father.
Maybe I'm not the right person.

315
00:34:33,708 --> 00:34:35,750
Every time I hear my mom's voice,

316
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:39,541
I'm overwhelmed with guilt.

317
00:34:41,416 --> 00:34:43,000
I can't take it anymore.

318
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:52,333
Forgive me, Father.

319
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,125
Please, forgive me.

320
00:34:59,916 --> 00:35:04,583
<i>Can I see this child</i>
<i>to verify if it's demonic possession?</i>

321
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,333
<i>When can you</i>
<i>and Michael come?</i>

322
00:35:08,208 --> 00:35:10,375
<i>Michael can't help anymore.</i>

323
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:11,625
Please.

324
00:35:12,375 --> 00:35:14,041
As you know,

325
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:19,958
these days the Vatican forbids priests
from performing exorcisms alone.

326
00:35:20,708 --> 00:35:22,750
You need an assistant.

327
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:25,208
Yes, but…

328
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:30,708
you know that not just anyone
can do this job.

329
00:35:31,291 --> 00:35:33,166
They mustn't just be brave and faithful.

330
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:37,166
They have to have come to terms
with their past.

331
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:47,000
Actually, I'm looking for a successor,

332
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:48,916
not just an assistant.

333
00:35:52,833 --> 00:35:54,375
If I remember correctly,

334
00:35:55,541 --> 00:35:59,458
a background in psychology
is also important for exorcism, right?

335
00:35:59,541 --> 00:36:00,500
Yes.

336
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:07,875
What if a priest
who hasn't made peace with his past

337
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,500
finds answers after learning from you?

338
00:36:19,083 --> 00:36:20,375
"THE POOR ARE THE TREASURE
OF THE CHURCH"

339
00:36:20,458 --> 00:36:22,416
<i>I'm not the right person for this.</i>

340
00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:25,041
Cadaster, you know I want to resign.

341
00:36:26,041 --> 00:36:29,416
This task pulls me back to church duties.

342
00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:34,083
How can you be sure
you're not the right one?

343
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:38,791
You haven't even tried.

344
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,291
Okay.

345
00:36:56,625 --> 00:36:59,833
I will help you with your resignation.

346
00:37:00,583 --> 00:37:01,791
But please,

347
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,333
help Father Rendra with this case.

348
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,166
My apologies, Father.

349
00:37:12,166 --> 00:37:13,375
I can't.

350
00:37:15,875 --> 00:37:19,416
I do want to quit, but not this way.

351
00:37:20,791 --> 00:37:23,791
I might end up hurting Father Rendra
or Kayla.

352
00:37:25,041 --> 00:37:27,166
You should know my faith is fragile.

353
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:31,833
Excuse me, I have to teach.

354
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:35,625
Diandra.

355
00:37:37,291 --> 00:37:38,375
Cilla.

356
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,083
They were both Kayla's best friends.

357
00:37:43,916 --> 00:37:45,583
Now she's on her own.

358
00:37:46,458 --> 00:37:48,583
Kayla is just like you.

359
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,166
Left alone by your loved ones.

360
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:54,416
At least do this for Kayla.

361
00:37:55,416 --> 00:37:57,166
She needs your help.

362
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:01,541
I'm late.

363
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Sssh!

364
00:38:34,541 --> 00:38:37,000
Kayla, be quiet.

365
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:47,916
What?

366
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,833
Get Father Thomas, now!

367
00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:53,333
Kayla!

368
00:38:53,416 --> 00:38:55,666
Kayla!

369
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,541
Kayla!

370
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,875
- Kayla! Father Thomas!
- Father!

371
00:38:58,958 --> 00:39:01,625
- Father Thomas! Kayla!
- Father!

372
00:39:03,083 --> 00:39:06,458
Kayla!
What's wrong with you?

373
00:39:06,541 --> 00:39:08,625
Kayla, wake up!

374
00:39:08,708 --> 00:39:10,916
You're a hypocrite.

375
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,291
A hypocrite! A hypocrite!

376
00:39:15,375 --> 00:39:17,375
Kayla! Wake up!

377
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:19,916
Kayla. Kayla!

378
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:22,208
Father…

379
00:39:23,541 --> 00:39:25,958
Come on. Help… help me
get her to the infirmary.

380
00:39:29,541 --> 00:39:32,958
EXAM TIME: 90 MINUTES
COMPLETED OR NOT, MUST BE COLLECTED

381
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:43,541
Why do sinners like me live longer

382
00:39:45,041 --> 00:39:50,333
than good people like Cilla,
Papa, and Diandra?

383
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,458
Why couldn't I have just died instead?

384
00:39:57,666 --> 00:39:59,000
Kayla.

385
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:08,125
Cilla's death was also my fault.

386
00:40:09,916 --> 00:40:12,708
I shouldn't have shared my problems.

387
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:17,500
I deserve this, Father. I'm full of sin.

388
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:18,750
Kayla, stop.

389
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:21,041
Enough.

390
00:40:24,708 --> 00:40:27,166
Humans tend to blame themselves

391
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:30,041
for the death of their loved ones.

392
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:35,375
But death is…

393
00:40:37,958 --> 00:40:39,250
inevitable.

394
00:40:53,666 --> 00:40:56,541
All we can do is move on.

395
00:40:57,375 --> 00:40:58,750
That's the only way.

396
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:04,750
There's something…

397
00:41:10,541 --> 00:41:12,458
I need to tell you something.

398
00:41:19,291 --> 00:41:22,125
It might be related to Cilla's death

399
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,416
and my situation.

400
00:41:28,041 --> 00:41:29,166
All because

401
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,875
- we played…
- Kayla.

402
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:37,416
Feeling better now?

403
00:41:38,291 --> 00:41:40,041
The principal wants to see you.

404
00:41:56,291 --> 00:41:58,416
Please understand Kayla's situation.

405
00:41:59,666 --> 00:42:01,583
She's still grieving.

406
00:42:02,666 --> 00:42:04,458
Her friend just passed away.

407
00:42:04,541 --> 00:42:07,250
With your permission,

408
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:09,708
I can contact a psychologist I know.

409
00:42:10,375 --> 00:42:12,000
Maybe it could help Kayla.

410
00:42:12,666 --> 00:42:15,291
I think she needs more help

411
00:42:15,375 --> 00:42:17,708
than just counseling at school.

412
00:42:18,625 --> 00:42:20,333
As long as she's willing,

413
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:22,458
I'm fine with it.

414
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:28,000
But I think Kayla just needs
to rest for now.

415
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:30,166
- But it's for her own good…
- Ma'am.

416
00:42:47,875 --> 00:42:50,333
<i>Thomas, I'm scared.</i>

417
00:42:52,166 --> 00:42:53,541
<i>Help me, Thomas.</i>

418
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:55,458
<i>It's so dark here.</i>

419
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:57,708
<i>Stay with me, Thomas.</i>

420
00:42:59,083 --> 00:43:00,583
<i>Stay with me.</i>

421
00:43:08,958 --> 00:43:10,541
Stay with me!

422
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:10,083
<i>Father!</i>

423
00:44:10,166 --> 00:44:13,958
<i>Go away! Go away! Go away!</i>

424
00:44:18,875 --> 00:44:20,083
{\an8}<i>Father!</i>

425
00:44:20,416 --> 00:44:24,000
{\an8}
<i>Go away! Go away! Go away!</i>

426
00:44:32,833 --> 00:44:35,041
I'm not trying to scare you.

427
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:38,166
But this is a dangerous task.

428
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:40,708
It's okay if you're not ready.

429
00:44:44,583 --> 00:44:48,708
Honestly,
it's not fear that's stopping me.

430
00:44:48,791 --> 00:44:51,500
Everything I feared in life has happened.

431
00:44:52,166 --> 00:44:53,916
So what made you hesitate?

432
00:44:54,875 --> 00:44:57,458
Father Roby said you refused at first.

433
00:45:01,708 --> 00:45:03,875
I'm not sure I can help others…

434
00:45:06,458 --> 00:45:08,666
when I need help myself.

435
00:45:12,041 --> 00:45:13,166
Thomas.

436
00:45:15,083 --> 00:45:16,416
Do you know why

437
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,250
the previous priest who helped me
decided to quit?

438
00:45:27,208 --> 00:45:28,958
When we fight against demons,

439
00:45:30,333 --> 00:45:34,375
they can see our emotions
and our past sins.

440
00:45:35,208 --> 00:45:38,833
They use those against us
to intimidate us.

441
00:45:38,916 --> 00:45:39,750
Are you ready?

442
00:45:41,708 --> 00:45:45,083
Not to mention how strong
the physical attacks are.

443
00:45:46,708 --> 00:45:49,125
They're rebellious angels.

444
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:52,291
They're not made of flesh like us.

445
00:45:53,458 --> 00:45:54,833
If you're not up for it,

446
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,958
then don't do it.

447
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,375
Speaking from what I've seen,

448
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:02,958
you'll give up and lose faith.

449
00:46:04,041 --> 00:46:06,458
It's dangerous
for both you and the victim.

450
00:46:07,958 --> 00:46:09,541
It's a matter of life and death.

451
00:46:18,333 --> 00:46:20,166
To do the exorcism…

452
00:46:22,375 --> 00:46:24,375
what do I need to learn, Father?

453
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:34,250
<i> Only 10%</i>
<i>of these cases actually need exorcism.</i>

454
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,250
<i>We need to be able to tell the difference.</i>

455
00:46:36,333 --> 00:46:38,708
Kiss the cross.

456
00:46:39,708 --> 00:46:42,833
You need to study this book

457
00:46:42,916 --> 00:46:46,250
about various types of demons
and their names.

458
00:46:46,333 --> 00:46:47,791
This is Kadastor.

459
00:47:00,375 --> 00:47:02,458
<i>The devil can see our sins.</i>

460
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,875
<i>So, we must make a confession</i>
<i>before performing an exorcism.</i>

461
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:10,583
…because I am angry with God.

462
00:47:11,375 --> 00:47:15,416
…because I didn't pray
for my late mother and sister.

463
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:19,625
<i>And most important of all is faith.</i>

464
00:47:20,333 --> 00:47:21,791
<i>We need to understand</i>

465
00:47:21,875 --> 00:47:25,541
<i>that this is God's power</i>
<i>against the dominion of darkness.</i>

466
00:47:26,125 --> 00:47:28,500
<i>So as servants of God,</i>

467
00:47:28,583 --> 00:47:30,208
<i>we need to be humble.</i>

468
00:47:30,791 --> 00:47:33,916
<i>Bear in mind that if we do succeed,</i>

469
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
<i>it's not our victory.</i>

470
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,541
<i>It's God's triumph.</i>

471
00:47:43,708 --> 00:47:45,250
Kayla.

472
00:48:13,458 --> 00:48:15,500
How are you feeling, Kay?

473
00:48:19,333 --> 00:48:23,250
Is there anything you want to share
about you and Cilla?

474
00:48:42,708 --> 00:48:44,833
I'm really sorry, Kay.

475
00:48:46,833 --> 00:48:49,958
Our communication's been off lately.

476
00:48:57,416 --> 00:49:02,041
You know, when I had you,

477
00:49:03,166 --> 00:49:06,250
I was still very young.

478
00:49:10,541 --> 00:49:14,916
I'm still trying
to be a good mother, Kayla.

479
00:49:28,541 --> 00:49:31,041
I went to the cemetery with Cilla.

480
00:49:32,875 --> 00:49:34,458
Maybe since then

481
00:49:35,625 --> 00:49:37,250
the terror started

482
00:49:38,333 --> 00:49:39,958
and Cilla's dead.

483
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,916
It's all my fault, Ma.

484
00:49:46,625 --> 00:49:48,208
You guys went to the cemetery?

485
00:49:50,375 --> 00:49:51,833
What for?

486
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,250
I missed Papa.

487
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:45,625
Mama! Mama! It's me, Kayla!

488
00:50:48,333 --> 00:50:49,750
What happened?

489
00:50:50,375 --> 00:50:51,791
It's me, Kayla.

490
00:51:14,541 --> 00:51:18,250
FATHER THOMAS

491
00:51:25,041 --> 00:51:26,125
Hello, Father.

492
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:33,041
Good afternoon, Ms. Maya.

493
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:36,041
This is Father Rendra.

494
00:51:37,083 --> 00:51:38,500
Good afternoon, Ms. Maya.

495
00:51:38,583 --> 00:51:41,458
Since Kayla is a girl,
I have Sister Indah with me.

496
00:51:42,875 --> 00:51:46,458
Yes. Thanks for coming, Father.

497
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:48,458
Please come on in.

498
00:51:49,208 --> 00:51:50,166
Go on.

499
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:54,875
No need to take them off.

500
00:51:55,375 --> 00:51:56,500
Please excuse us.

501
00:51:59,166 --> 00:52:00,583
Excuse me.

502
00:52:05,541 --> 00:52:07,000
This way, Father.

503
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:11,416
Father Thomas told me about the situation.
How's Kayla?

504
00:52:12,208 --> 00:52:13,958
Any other bizarre incidents?

505
00:52:14,541 --> 00:52:15,791
Yes, Father.

506
00:52:15,875 --> 00:52:20,250
Kayla told me that ever since she
and Cilla went to the cemetery,

507
00:52:20,333 --> 00:52:23,625
they've been experiencing terrors.

508
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:28,333
Well, occultism is one of the gateways
to dominions of darkness.

509
00:52:40,458 --> 00:52:41,458
Kayla.

510
00:52:42,791 --> 00:52:44,333
Meet Father Rendra.

511
00:52:45,416 --> 00:52:47,166
He will pray for you today.

512
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:50,291
Ah…

513
00:52:51,625 --> 00:52:53,541
Please wait outside.

514
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:56,583
During the whole process,

515
00:52:56,666 --> 00:52:58,958
please recite the Apostles' Creed.

516
00:52:59,541 --> 00:53:00,750
Can you do that?

517
00:53:29,541 --> 00:53:31,583
Kayla, how are you feeling?

518
00:53:32,833 --> 00:53:34,708
I'm fine, Father.

519
00:53:43,458 --> 00:53:44,833
In the name of Jesus.

520
00:53:46,625 --> 00:53:48,041
In the name of Jesus.

521
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:50,791
In the name of Jesus.

522
00:54:04,958 --> 00:54:08,083
Dear God, have mercy on us.

523
00:54:08,958 --> 00:54:11,625
Dear God, have mercy on us.

524
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:16,458
Christ, have mercy on us.

525
00:54:16,541 --> 00:54:19,208
Christ, have mercy on us.

526
00:54:19,291 --> 00:54:22,708
In the name of the Holy Trinity,
have mercy on us.

527
00:54:22,791 --> 00:54:27,125
In the name
of the Holy Trinity, have mercy on us.

528
00:54:27,208 --> 00:54:28,875
I cast you out,

529
00:54:29,416 --> 00:54:32,041
unclean spirit,

530
00:54:32,833 --> 00:54:35,500
along with every Satanic power
of the enemy,

531
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,625
every specter from hell,

532
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:39,333
and all your fallen companions.

533
00:54:40,041 --> 00:54:43,041
In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,

534
00:54:43,125 --> 00:54:48,750
begone and stay far
from this creature of God.

535
00:54:48,833 --> 00:54:53,208
For it is He who flung you
from the heights of heaven

536
00:54:53,291 --> 00:54:55,791
into the depths of hell.

537
00:54:57,625 --> 00:55:00,625
He who comforts you.

538
00:55:01,291 --> 00:55:04,166
He who once stilled the sea
and the wind and the storm.

539
00:55:10,458 --> 00:55:12,208
I bind

540
00:55:12,875 --> 00:55:14,708
all enemies of Christ.

541
00:55:15,291 --> 00:55:19,291
In the name of Jesus Christ,
I command

542
00:55:19,666 --> 00:55:21,250
all enemies of Christ

543
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:25,875
with no power over our lives to be gone!

544
00:55:35,708 --> 00:55:37,375
I'm fine, Father.

545
00:55:38,583 --> 00:55:40,333
Why won't you believe me?

546
00:55:43,875 --> 00:55:45,708
In the name of Jesus Christ,

547
00:55:47,375 --> 00:55:49,791
I sever all ties,

548
00:55:49,875 --> 00:55:52,333
all bonds, and all connections,

549
00:55:52,416 --> 00:55:56,375
between Kayla and any demonic sources.

550
00:55:58,083 --> 00:56:00,875
What's this? I said I'm fine now.

551
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:04,041
You're just stressing me out!

552
00:56:07,041 --> 00:56:08,875
Perhaps the demon has gone.

553
00:56:11,708 --> 00:56:14,666
I adjure you, ancient serpent,

554
00:56:15,416 --> 00:56:17,958
by the Judge of the living and the dead,

555
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,333
by your Creator,

556
00:56:19,416 --> 00:56:21,250
by the Creator of the whole universe,

557
00:56:22,416 --> 00:56:25,333
by Him who has the power
to consign you to hell,

558
00:56:26,625 --> 00:56:29,125
to begone from this servant of God, Kayla…

559
00:56:30,958 --> 00:56:34,250
…who seeks refuge
in the fold of the Church,

560
00:56:34,333 --> 00:56:38,166
and to depart forthwith in fear,
along with your savage minions!

561
00:56:44,166 --> 00:56:47,291
Kayla, stop!

562
00:56:47,375 --> 00:56:49,375
Kayla, let go!

563
00:56:51,041 --> 00:56:53,416
Sister!

564
00:56:54,291 --> 00:56:55,958
Sister. Sister!

565
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:02,750
Kayla, wake up!
Wake up, Kayla!

566
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:11,000
Father!

567
00:57:12,666 --> 00:57:14,125
Father, can I come in?

568
00:57:14,208 --> 00:57:17,291
No! Continue praying!

569
00:57:17,375 --> 00:57:21,375
Thomas!
Help me! Hurry up!

570
00:57:23,166 --> 00:57:24,916
Kayla.

571
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,666
Get that thing away from me!

572
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:31,750
In the name of Jesus Christ,
leave, unclean spirit!

573
00:57:35,083 --> 00:57:36,708
Dear Lord, please help us!

574
00:57:38,208 --> 00:57:39,916
Help me, Thomas.

575
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:43,875
Thomas!
Thomas, get a hold of yourself!

576
00:57:43,958 --> 00:57:45,250
Get a hold of yourself!

577
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,958
- Kayla!
- She's not Kayla!

578
00:58:08,541 --> 00:58:10,333
Hold her!

579
00:58:12,916 --> 00:58:15,583
In the name of Jesus Christ,
reveal your name!

580
00:58:20,166 --> 00:58:22,000
Reveal your name!

581
00:58:22,083 --> 00:58:24,041
You damn priest!

582
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:26,250
You're all sinners.

583
00:58:26,333 --> 00:58:28,666
You belong in hell!

584
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:33,458
In the name of Jesus Christ, the Lord
of heaven and earth, reveal your name!

585
00:58:37,583 --> 00:58:42,375
Dagal!

586
00:58:42,458 --> 00:58:46,875
In the name of Jesus Christ
I command you, Dagal,

587
00:58:46,958 --> 00:58:50,458
leave and yield
under the feet of Christ!

588
00:58:50,541 --> 00:58:52,250
Leave!

589
00:58:56,791 --> 00:58:58,708
It's okay now.

590
00:59:10,333 --> 00:59:15,833
All praises and glory to You, my Lord.

591
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:17,791
Thank you. Amen.

592
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:20,791
Mommy's here, Kayla.

593
00:59:36,958 --> 00:59:38,083
Forgive me.

594
00:59:40,166 --> 00:59:41,958
I couldn't help much.

595
00:59:44,291 --> 00:59:45,791
Don't worry about it.

596
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:49,166
You did your best

597
00:59:50,083 --> 00:59:54,000
and didn't give up till the end,
no matter how hard it was.

598
00:59:56,791 --> 00:59:57,791
Thank you.

599
01:00:25,708 --> 01:00:28,375
GETTING TIRED OF STUDYING ALL THE TIME,
SO WE FINALLY TOOK A PHOTO

600
01:00:33,125 --> 01:00:34,833
I'M SO HAPPY! MAMA GAVE ME
A SPECIAL PRESENT TODAY.

601
01:00:34,916 --> 01:00:37,166
DENIS, YOU JERK! YOU'D BETTER DIE!

602
01:00:41,708 --> 01:00:48,208
{\an8}MAMA TRUSTS THE PLAYBOY
MORE THAN HER OWN DAUGHTER!

603
01:00:49,208 --> 01:00:52,875
GOD, PLEASE KEEP MAMA AWAY
FROM THAT JERK!

604
01:00:52,958 --> 01:00:57,416
THANKS, PAPA, FOR HELPING ME AND MOM!
AND FOR GETTING RID OF THAT JERK!

605
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:58,958
DIE! DIE! DIE!

606
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:54,750
YOU SHOULD SEE THIS

607
01:02:51,875 --> 01:02:53,750
You still wish to resign?

608
01:02:58,583 --> 01:02:59,916
Truth be told,

609
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,291
it's hard for the church to let you go.

610
01:03:03,375 --> 01:03:04,958
Especially now

611
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,583
that Father Rendra has asked me

612
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:11,500
if he can take you under his wing.

613
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:14,708
Forgive me, Father.

614
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:20,000
I hope he can get a better partner.

615
01:03:20,916 --> 01:03:22,750
He doesn't just need a partner.

616
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:27,166
He needs a successor.

617
01:03:29,083 --> 01:03:32,833
He has been sick for a long time now,

618
01:03:34,458 --> 01:03:36,333
and I believe

619
01:03:37,458 --> 01:03:39,583
that you have what it takes.

620
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:42,625
I'm worried

621
01:03:42,708 --> 01:03:49,250
because when he retires
and can no longer perform exorcisms,

622
01:03:50,041 --> 01:03:51,708
who will be able to take over?

623
01:04:02,916 --> 01:04:04,083
Very well.

624
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:08,916
I'll proceed with your resignation,

625
01:04:09,416 --> 01:04:10,916
as I promised you.

626
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,291
Thank you, Father.

627
01:05:03,541 --> 01:05:04,833
How impressive.

628
01:05:06,208 --> 01:05:07,666
- Try it out.
- Okay.

629
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:10,208
Hey.

630
01:05:10,291 --> 01:05:12,416
If your father were alive

631
01:05:13,125 --> 01:05:14,541
he would've been proud.

632
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:16,708
- I'll try it out.
- Mm.

633
01:05:16,791 --> 01:05:17,750
Here.

634
01:05:22,166 --> 01:05:23,750
I'm proud too.

635
01:05:24,875 --> 01:05:26,541
- Really?
- Mm-hmm!

636
01:05:26,625 --> 01:05:28,750
- Does it suit me?
- It suits you.

637
01:05:28,833 --> 01:05:30,708
It does.

638
01:05:30,791 --> 01:05:34,458
We have something for you.

639
01:05:38,166 --> 01:05:39,125
Thank you.

640
01:05:39,666 --> 01:05:40,958
Just a thank you?

641
01:05:41,041 --> 01:05:43,083
- What else do you want?
- Ice cream.

642
01:05:43,625 --> 01:05:46,625
- I want a lot of them.
- You eat too much.

643
01:05:46,708 --> 01:05:48,458
You eat ice cream every day.

644
01:06:02,666 --> 01:06:04,250
Please pray for me.

645
01:06:42,458 --> 01:06:43,416
Kayla?

646
01:06:46,958 --> 01:06:48,041
Kayla.

647
01:06:50,625 --> 01:06:51,833
What are you doing?

648
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,583
I wish I could sleep
with you more.

649
01:07:34,208 --> 01:07:35,500
What's wrong, Ma?

650
01:07:54,916 --> 01:07:57,166
Kayla!

651
01:08:05,041 --> 01:08:09,833
Kayla? Kayla!

652
01:08:09,916 --> 01:08:13,166
- This is your plan? You want to kill me?
- Mama!

653
01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:17,000
- Denis! Denis!
- Mama!

654
01:08:17,708 --> 01:08:19,458
You okay, Kay?

655
01:08:19,833 --> 01:08:22,208
Stop it! She's my daughter!

656
01:08:22,291 --> 01:08:23,500
Maya.

657
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:25,291
Listen to me.

658
01:08:26,208 --> 01:08:27,458
Please.

659
01:08:27,541 --> 01:08:28,958
Take a good look.

660
01:08:29,041 --> 01:08:31,541
She's not Kayla.
I'm sure she's still possessed!

661
01:08:32,291 --> 01:08:33,958
Now you see his true nature.

662
01:08:36,291 --> 01:08:39,375
- I told you he was a jerk, Mama!
- Kayla!

663
01:08:39,708 --> 01:08:41,083
Watch your mouth.

664
01:08:41,166 --> 01:08:43,375
Wait, why am I the bad guy here?

665
01:08:43,458 --> 01:08:45,291
As if you're the victim, Kayla.

666
01:08:45,958 --> 01:08:46,916
Wow.

667
01:08:50,916 --> 01:08:52,291
You think I don't know?

668
01:08:54,541 --> 01:08:56,875
Your mom found your <i>jelangkung.</i>

669
01:08:59,208 --> 01:09:00,416
You used <i>jelangkung…</i>

670
01:09:02,375 --> 01:09:04,000
to split us up.

671
01:09:06,875 --> 01:09:08,083
Right?

672
01:09:09,166 --> 01:09:11,291
Do you trust him or me?

673
01:09:13,625 --> 01:09:15,625
Denis, please.

674
01:09:15,708 --> 01:09:18,583
I want us to talk nicely, not like this!

675
01:09:18,666 --> 01:09:19,833
Really, Maya?

676
01:09:21,291 --> 01:09:22,458
Talk?

677
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:30,625
You wanted to be a good mom, right?

678
01:09:35,083 --> 01:09:36,333
Prove it.

679
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:38,958
Leave him!

680
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:40,166
- What…?
- Take this!

681
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,250
- Denis!
- What the hell?

682
01:09:58,541 --> 01:10:00,000
You are both crazy.

683
01:10:06,875 --> 01:10:08,250
Are you okay, Kay?

684
01:10:08,791 --> 01:10:10,208
It's okay.

685
01:11:09,708 --> 01:11:11,125
Good evening.

686
01:11:13,958 --> 01:11:15,291
Father Rendra.

687
01:11:16,375 --> 01:11:18,250
- How are you?
- I'm good.

688
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
How are you and Kayla?

689
01:11:26,416 --> 01:11:28,500
Since you prayed for her,

690
01:11:29,541 --> 01:11:32,916
things have been getting worse between us.

691
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:38,958
I feel so restless lately.

692
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:44,333
I feel like I made things hard
for my daughter.

693
01:11:46,708 --> 01:11:49,000
Why do you think so?

694
01:11:51,083 --> 01:11:53,708
I have a dark past, Father.

695
01:11:57,541 --> 01:12:01,041
I got pregnant
when I was still in high school.

696
01:12:02,416 --> 01:12:04,708
My parents kicked me out.

697
01:12:06,583 --> 01:12:08,625
My life was a mess.

698
01:12:10,208 --> 01:12:14,125
Until I finally met
and married my husband.

699
01:12:16,916 --> 01:12:20,333
He led me to Jesus Christ, Father.

700
01:12:22,541 --> 01:12:25,458
Kayla doesn't know, even now,

701
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:28,541
that he wasn't her birth father.

702
01:12:29,791 --> 01:12:31,500
Ever since he passed away,

703
01:12:32,375 --> 01:12:36,166
we've been losing our way.

704
01:12:38,833 --> 01:12:41,666
Well, everyone has a past.

705
01:12:43,083 --> 01:12:44,708
It doesn't matter.

706
01:12:45,833 --> 01:12:47,333
The present does.

707
01:12:47,916 --> 01:12:52,041
Where we live in a godly way
and take responsibility for our sins.

708
01:12:53,083 --> 01:12:54,625
Remember,

709
01:12:54,708 --> 01:12:59,500
God will never give us
more than what we can bear.

710
01:13:03,583 --> 01:13:05,250
And I believe

711
01:13:05,333 --> 01:13:08,208
that I'm here as His servant,

712
01:13:08,291 --> 01:13:11,458
giving strength to you and Kayla
to overcome this.

713
01:13:16,875 --> 01:13:18,333
- Father.
- Yes?

714
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:22,416
I don't know where to start,

715
01:13:23,125 --> 01:13:26,458
but I found <i>jelangkung </i>in Kayla's room.

716
01:13:26,541 --> 01:13:30,833
And I feel like she's not
fully healed yet, Father.

717
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,416
I still feel threatened, Father.

718
01:13:35,083 --> 01:13:38,000
Father, are you okay?

719
01:13:38,583 --> 01:13:41,000
I'm okay.

720
01:14:03,458 --> 01:14:05,125
{\an8}THE BIBLE

721
01:14:05,208 --> 01:14:09,750
"Then it goes and takes with it seven
other spirits more wicked than itself,

722
01:14:10,458 --> 01:14:12,541
<i>and they go in and live there."</i>

723
01:14:13,083 --> 01:14:17,500
<i>"And the final condition of that person</i>
<i>is worse than the first."</i>

724
01:14:17,958 --> 01:14:22,208
<i>"That is how it will be</i>
<i>with this wicked generation."</i>

725
01:14:36,041 --> 01:14:37,708
Thomas? Hello?

726
01:14:43,541 --> 01:14:46,208
- <i>Hello</i>?
- Thomas! Hello! Hello!

727
01:14:46,291 --> 01:14:47,583
- <i>Father</i>?
- Thomas?

728
01:15:39,333 --> 01:15:40,416
Kayla.

729
01:15:47,166 --> 01:15:48,416
Father.

730
01:15:48,833 --> 01:15:50,083
Why are you here?

731
01:15:54,416 --> 01:15:55,416
Kay.

732
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:57,375
Kayla!

733
01:17:12,041 --> 01:17:15,333
I'm sorry, Father.
I'm sorry, Ma.

734
01:17:15,416 --> 01:17:17,666
Kay?

735
01:17:19,583 --> 01:17:20,916
Kayla?

736
01:17:22,041 --> 01:17:24,375
What happened?

737
01:17:24,458 --> 01:17:27,791
- I'm sorry, Father.
- Kay?

738
01:17:27,875 --> 01:17:30,708
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm sorry, Father.

739
01:17:30,791 --> 01:17:32,958
Kay? Kayla!

740
01:17:38,708 --> 01:17:41,333
Die. Die. Die.

741
01:17:41,416 --> 01:17:43,958
Die. Die. Die.

742
01:17:44,041 --> 01:17:45,541
Die. Die.

743
01:18:12,291 --> 01:18:15,041
I thought you two

744
01:18:15,125 --> 01:18:17,833
had managed to get rid of the demon.

745
01:18:18,333 --> 01:18:19,458
I'm sorry, Father.

746
01:18:20,333 --> 01:18:22,083
I didn't realize it sooner.

747
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:27,250
We thought it was
just a result of occultism.

748
01:18:28,166 --> 01:18:29,666
But it's more than that.

749
01:18:30,541 --> 01:18:31,875
It's a case of Legion.

750
01:18:33,666 --> 01:18:36,083
There wasn't just one of them.

751
01:18:37,125 --> 01:18:38,125
What are you saying?

752
01:18:38,666 --> 01:18:40,208
Kayla played <i>jelangkung</i>

753
01:18:41,583 --> 01:18:43,916
to summon the spirit of her late father.

754
01:18:44,875 --> 01:18:47,250
But Lucifer's disciple came instead.

755
01:18:48,125 --> 01:18:51,958
<i>Dagal is Lucifer's disciple from hell.</i>

756
01:18:52,041 --> 01:18:56,583
<i>I'm afraid there are other disciples</i>
<i>who have also possessed Kayla.</i>

757
01:18:56,666 --> 01:18:59,291
<i>And the last one standing</i>
<i>is the strongest one.</i>

758
01:19:02,791 --> 01:19:05,250
Ms. Maya's life
could be in danger.

759
01:19:05,333 --> 01:19:06,916
Both of their lives could be.

760
01:19:07,416 --> 01:19:08,208
Right.

761
01:19:10,166 --> 01:19:11,041
Father.

762
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:15,541
Let me help Kayla.

763
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:24,291
You'd better leave now.

764
01:19:24,916 --> 01:19:27,875
I'll ask the bishop for permission later.

765
01:19:27,958 --> 01:19:30,125
Their lives are what's most important now.

766
01:19:33,708 --> 01:19:34,666
Thomas.

767
01:19:36,875 --> 01:19:38,291
May God be with you.

768
01:19:41,791 --> 01:19:43,541
And you, Father.

769
01:20:21,416 --> 01:20:22,541
Kayla.

770
01:20:29,375 --> 01:20:30,541
Kay?

771
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:33,208
- Die. Die.
- It's Mama.

772
01:20:33,291 --> 01:20:36,708
- Die. Die. Die.
- Kayla?

773
01:20:36,791 --> 01:20:39,958
- Die.
- Kayla? Please wake up.

774
01:20:40,041 --> 01:20:42,500
Die. Die.

775
01:20:44,333 --> 01:20:45,708
It's Mama.

776
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:48,666
Kayla.

777
01:21:04,291 --> 01:21:08,416
Wake up, Kayla. This is your mama.

778
01:21:09,083 --> 01:21:12,083
A sinner like you
deserves to die.

779
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:20,625
Kayla!

780
01:21:20,708 --> 01:21:23,166
Kayla! Please wake up!

781
01:21:36,708 --> 01:21:38,708
Open the door!

782
01:21:41,541 --> 01:21:42,833
Open it!

783
01:22:14,458 --> 01:22:15,666
Mama?

784
01:22:24,625 --> 01:22:26,666
Mama.

785
01:22:29,916 --> 01:22:32,208
Mama.

786
01:23:20,416 --> 01:23:23,791
It's time to meet your husband.

787
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,750
Kay!

788
01:23:35,833 --> 01:23:37,541
Help!

789
01:23:37,625 --> 01:23:39,208
Kayla!

790
01:23:46,833 --> 01:23:47,791
Kayla, wait!

791
01:23:56,250 --> 01:23:59,333
I won't stop
until all your people

792
01:23:59,416 --> 01:24:01,416
turn against Him!

793
01:24:07,916 --> 01:24:08,791
Kayla!

794
01:24:10,041 --> 01:24:12,666
See you in hell.

795
01:24:14,916 --> 01:24:16,833
Kayla!

796
01:24:17,958 --> 01:24:19,208
Kayla?

797
01:24:19,583 --> 01:24:20,791
Kayla!

798
01:24:21,666 --> 01:24:24,708
Kayla!

799
01:24:24,791 --> 01:24:26,250
- Kayla!
- Kayla!

800
01:24:26,333 --> 01:24:29,125
Kayla!

801
01:24:59,583 --> 01:25:02,916
Kayla!

802
01:25:04,125 --> 01:25:05,958
Oh my God!

803
01:25:06,041 --> 01:25:09,333
- In the name of the Father…
- It's no use to pray.

804
01:25:09,416 --> 01:25:12,625
Even His power can't stop me!

805
01:25:20,250 --> 01:25:21,916
Our Father who art in heaven…

806
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,500
Hasn't He failed to save
your mother and sister?

807
01:25:25,583 --> 01:25:27,750
Thy kingdom come!

808
01:25:27,833 --> 01:25:32,416
Thy will be done on earth
as it is in heaven!

809
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:35,500
In the name of Jesus Christ,
I cast you out, demon!

810
01:25:47,166 --> 01:25:48,333
Thomas…

811
01:25:48,875 --> 01:25:51,166
Thomas, I don't want to die here.

812
01:25:57,291 --> 01:25:59,625
I cast you out, unclean spirit!
The dominion of darkness…

813
01:25:59,708 --> 01:26:00,958
It hurts…

814
01:26:02,958 --> 01:26:04,458
In the name of Jesus…

815
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:14,333
Don't kill him!

816
01:26:14,416 --> 01:26:17,208
- Surrender!
- Don't kill him!

817
01:26:17,291 --> 01:26:19,083
- Surrender!
- Help!

818
01:26:21,166 --> 01:26:22,500
Help!

819
01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:25,791
Father!

820
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:41,625
Release Kayla!

821
01:26:41,708 --> 01:26:43,500
She's innocent.

822
01:26:44,291 --> 01:26:45,916
I'm the sinner.

823
01:26:46,708 --> 01:26:48,250
Take my body.

824
01:26:51,625 --> 01:26:54,708
Kill yourself. And I'll go.

825
01:27:01,875 --> 01:27:03,416
Keep your promise.

826
01:27:14,916 --> 01:27:19,208
I'm sure that Diandra
would be happy in heaven to see you smile.

827
01:27:20,916 --> 01:27:22,291
God is with me.

828
01:27:24,041 --> 01:27:25,541
God is with me!

829
01:27:26,125 --> 01:27:27,583
I'm proud too.

830
01:27:28,375 --> 01:27:31,583
We have something for you.

831
01:27:42,916 --> 01:27:46,166
Kayla?

832
01:27:49,666 --> 01:27:51,416
Please, forgive me.

833
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,250
No, Ma.

834
01:27:54,833 --> 01:27:56,666
It's for your sake, Kayla.

835
01:27:57,625 --> 01:27:59,375
Don't leave me, Ma!

836
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:03,125
God has promised to always be by my side.

837
01:28:20,833 --> 01:28:24,750
By the power of Jesus Christ
I condemn you, demon!

838
01:28:24,833 --> 01:28:27,583
Meet your demise!

839
01:28:34,333 --> 01:28:38,125
I cast you out, unclean spirit,

840
01:28:38,208 --> 01:28:40,875
along with every Satanic power
of the enemy,

841
01:28:40,958 --> 01:28:42,416
every specter from hell,

842
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:44,291
and all your fallen companions.

843
01:28:44,375 --> 01:28:47,125
In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,

844
01:28:47,208 --> 01:28:50,916
begone from this creature of God!

845
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:55,250
Begone, you godless being!
Begone, you, the condemned!

846
01:28:55,333 --> 01:28:57,750
Begone with all your trickeries!

847
01:28:57,833 --> 01:29:00,958
For God has commanded humans
to be His temple!

848
01:29:01,583 --> 01:29:04,125
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit,

849
01:29:04,708 --> 01:29:06,250
reveal yourself, demon!

850
01:29:10,458 --> 01:29:14,833
In the name of Jesus Christ,
reveal your name!

851
01:29:14,916 --> 01:29:19,041
Zababel!

852
01:29:19,125 --> 01:29:20,791
Zababel, the condemned demon,

853
01:29:21,958 --> 01:29:23,875
in the name of Jesus Christ,

854
01:29:23,958 --> 01:29:26,333
begone from Kayla's body!

855
01:29:32,166 --> 01:29:34,416
Kayla? Kayla! Kayla!

856
01:29:37,125 --> 01:29:38,041
Kayla.

857
01:29:43,750 --> 01:29:45,208
Thank you, Lord.

858
01:29:57,500 --> 01:30:01,666
{\an8}

859
01:30:19,916 --> 01:30:23,333
GET WELL SOON, FATHER RENDRA
FROM MAYA AND KAYLA

860
01:30:28,583 --> 01:30:29,958
Aren't you leaving?

861
01:30:30,625 --> 01:30:32,041
You're not fully recovered.

862
01:30:34,625 --> 01:30:37,500
If you wish to leave, then go.
I won't stop you.

863
01:30:40,625 --> 01:30:42,833
I've found my purpose, Father.

864
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,625
God is with me here.

865
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:51,750
Actually, you've always known.

866
01:30:52,791 --> 01:30:55,583
God never makes mistakes
in choosing His servants.

867
01:30:59,041 --> 01:31:00,791
Help me from now on.

868
01:31:02,750 --> 01:31:04,583
You've got a lot to learn.

869
01:31:06,291 --> 01:31:07,541
Yes, Father.

870
01:31:21,458 --> 01:31:22,458
PRISONER

871
01:31:28,708 --> 01:31:30,333
I'm really sorry, sir.

872
01:31:30,416 --> 01:31:31,791
I…

873
01:31:32,458 --> 01:31:33,958
Please forgive me.

874
01:31:36,291 --> 01:31:38,708
I didn't mean to run away.

875
01:31:39,666 --> 01:31:41,125
I was just scared.

876
01:31:42,458 --> 01:31:44,125
I forgive you.

877
01:31:48,125 --> 01:31:51,541
THEN JESUS SPOKE AGAIN, SAYING:
"I AM THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD."

878
01:31:51,625 --> 01:31:54,541
"THE ONE WHO FOLLOWS ME
WILL NEVER WALK IN DARKNESS,

879
01:31:54,625 --> 01:31:56,875
BUT WILL HAVE THE LIGHT OF LIFE."

880
01:31:56,958 --> 01:31:58,208
JOHN 8:12

881
01:32:13,958 --> 01:32:15,333
FATHER RENDRA

882
01:32:16,541 --> 01:32:19,125
<i>Thomas, sorry to bother you.</i>

883
01:32:19,208 --> 01:32:21,041
<i>Someone needs help tonight.</i>

884
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:24,083
<i>We need to do the exorcism now.</i>

885
01:32:24,458 --> 01:32:25,750
<i>Please come quickly.</i>

3
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:14,414
...you're saying Jews

4
00:00:14,415 --> 00:00:15,915
use the blood
of Christian babies

5
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:17,217
for-for what was it?

6
00:00:17,218 --> 00:00:18,618
Well, for their services,

7
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:20,287
their rituals, their dinners,

8
00:00:20,288 --> 00:00:22,021
so they can
take over the world.

9
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,223
For their dinners?

10
00:00:23,224 --> 00:00:24,724
Oh, okay, I see.

11
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:27,227
So do they serve it in cups,
this Christian blood?

12
00:00:27,228 --> 00:00:28,628
Is it a drink,

13
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:29,729
or is it more of a-a condiment,

14
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,431
like a-a gravy

15
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:32,932
that we can pour over food?

16
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:34,234
Because I've never been
to one of these rituals,

17
00:00:34,235 --> 00:00:35,302
so I don't know.

18
00:00:35,303 --> 00:00:36,569
Are you making fun of me,

19
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,604
- you son of a bitch?
-  No, sir,

20
00:00:37,605 --> 00:00:38,638
not at all.

21
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:40,073
You don't need my help for that.

22
00:00:40,074 --> 00:00:42,909
I just want to know how I
can take over the world. Me.

23
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,311
See?
You're trying to bait me,

24
00:00:44,312 --> 00:00:46,313
but I'm just trying
to answer your question,

25
00:00:46,314 --> 00:00:47,880
you dumb kike!

26
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:48,748
All right, that's it,

27
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:50,049
that's enough.

28
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,819
Lot of antisemitism
cooking here today.

29
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,121
Thanks, caller,

30
00:00:54,122 --> 00:00:57,257
for that load
of puritanical garbage.

31
00:00:57,258 --> 00:00:58,625
You know what my problem is

32
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:01,461
with every fanatic
fundamentalist,

33
00:01:01,462 --> 00:01:02,629
from the Catholics,

34
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:03,630
to the Orthodox,

35
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:06,466
to the KKK?

36
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:08,635
The one thing you all have
in common is,

37
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:10,837
and you're too ignorant
to see it,

38
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:14,073
is that you're too inept

39
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,177
to get by in the world,

40
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:19,846
so your-your only recourse

41
00:01:19,847 --> 00:01:23,884
is to try and curtail
the enjoyment of others.

42
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:27,987
Well, there it is.

43
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:29,689
It's a great country,

44
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,692
but we're all still trapped
in our minds.

45
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,499
â™ª K-O-A...

46
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,000
Hey, gimme, uh,
gimme that bottle.

47
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:42,101
I happen to believe

48
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,303
that most people
are decent people.

49
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:44,604
- I really believe that,
- You hear this shit?

50
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,506
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

51
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:47,307
This fucking Jew, man.

52
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:48,508
Yeah.

53
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:51,144
Ah, fuck. Fuck him.

54
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:54,881
He needs a couple barrels
in his mouth.

55
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:56,949
Why are we out here
in the dark?

56
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,018
What does Bob want?

57
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:00,720
What is he fucking hunting
out in the dark?

58
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,121
I don't know.

59
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,857
- Is he hunting bats?
- ...you think the Jews...

60
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,125
- Maybe he wants you to join?
- ...are that organized?

61
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,361
Wow, I wish
we were that organized.

62
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:11,130
- Here we go.
- Until tomorrow here at KOA...

63
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,565
This is it up here.

64
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:13,400
Fucking safety that gun.

65
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:14,734
Thanks for listening.

66
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:17,470
This is Alan Berg,
and be safe.

67
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:19,639
He's saying, "Get the fuck out!

68
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,073
Get the fuck outta here!"

69
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,141
I'm going, "All right,
all right, all right!"

70
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,543
I'm walking, it's dripping

71
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:25,745
while I'm fucking
walking out of this bar.

72
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:28,248
I'm splashing in my own piss.

73
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:29,549
She didn't think
it was very funny,

74
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,651
but I thought
it was pretty damn funny.

75
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:32,985
Where the fuck are we going?

76
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,021
I don't get it, man,
if Bob wanted to talk,

77
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:36,957
why didn't we just do it
at the fucking bar?

78
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:47,934
Well, that's the problem
right there, Walt.

79
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:50,370
You talk too much.

80
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:11,591
Well, that shut him up.

81
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:14,881
Hey.

82
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:16,484
It's me.

83
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:21,121
How are you all?

84
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:24,424
I got here,

85
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:25,558
and, uh...

86
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:32,432
I'm settling in,

87
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:33,701
but, um...

88
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,206
you know, it feels kinda empty.

89
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,743
So, um,

90
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:46,946
no rush, but...

91
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:49,749
when are you guys coming out?

92
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,786
I thought maybe, uh,

93
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:55,121
a week, two weeks...

94
00:05:58,626 --> 00:06:01,360
...but you should see the...

95
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,930
the landscape is...

96
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:06,132
well, like they said,

97
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:07,967
it's really something.

98
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,739
Thinking them girls,

99
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,643
they could go on, uh, hikes.

100
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,947
Or not.

101
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:22,415
Well, just call.

102
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,351
Yeah, let me know the plans.

103
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:28,321
All right, I love you.

104
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:01,287
81, clear.

105
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:02,890
88-14, clear.

106
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:05,825
Where's the bomb, Gary?

107
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:08,194
Why didn't it go off?

108
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:09,428
I don't know.

109
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,097
...10-13, Haley Street

110
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,599
second and third...

111
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,800
Sorry, Bob.

112
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:18,471
What do you wanna do?

113
00:07:18,472 --> 00:07:21,674
- Safe going.
- You too, agent...

114
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:22,842
Keep listening.

115
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,983
Get on the fucking floor.

116
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:33,285
Call your manager right now,
or you're dead!

117
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,286
- Don't look at me!
- Get on the floor!

118
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,955
- What's his name?
- Ralph.

119
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,123
- Say it louder!
- Ralph!

120
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,858
Ralph, get out here!
Where is he?

121
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:39,726
On the floor. Back up!

122
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:41,027
What's going on?

123
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:42,061
Open the safe.

124
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:43,462
Put your hands up.
Look at me.

125
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,864
Don't you fucking look at him,
or I'll shoot you!

126
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:47,233
Don't fucking flinch.
Ralph, open the safe,

127
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:48,735
or she's dead,
do you understand?

128
00:07:48,736 --> 00:07:50,369
- Are you deaf, motherfucker?
- Ralph, I'll kill her!

129
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,237
Hey!

130
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:52,371
Tell Ralph you want to live.

131
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:53,706
- Ralph, I want to live.
- Tell him louder.

132
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:55,074
Ralph, I want to live!

133
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:56,342
Open it! Now, now, now, now!

134
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:58,077
- Okay, put the money in the bag!
- Okay.

135
00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:00,312
Put the money in the bag.
Open the register right now.

136
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,715
Who the fuck did that?

137
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:03,584
Don't fucking move.

138
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,887
Turn it to the fucking number.

139
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:10,489
Piece of shit,
let's go, let's go!

140
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,191
It's your fucking bank, asshole!
Do it!

141
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:12,959
- I'm trying!
- Come on, open it!

142
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,561
I will shoot you right now.

143
00:08:14,562 --> 00:08:15,895
Get the hundreds first,
the big bills first!

144
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:17,697
You piece of shit,
open the fucking door.

145
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:20,266
Now!

146
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:22,334
Move, move, move.

147
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,335
Report of a fire alarm

148
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,537
and no contacts inside.

149
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:27,073
4-7-1-1 en route.
We'll be right there.

150
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:30,109
Thanks, 4-7-1-1.

151
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,210
Help him out.

152
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:32,745
Get in the safe!

153
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,914
Give me the bag,
give me the bag! Let's go!

154
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:36,783
Get on the fucking floor!

155
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:37,917
Ma'am, money in the bag.

156
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:40,086
Faster!

157
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:41,555
Move! Come on!

158
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:44,023
Drop it.

159
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,592
Now.

160
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:48,394
Get the fuck over there.

161
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:51,097
Faster! Come on!

162
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:52,865
- Move!
- Let's go!

163
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,867
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Give me the bag.

164
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:55,635
Get on the floor!

165
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:57,303
- Let's go!
- That's it!

166
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:58,304
That's time, let's go!

167
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:02,743
Keep your heads down!
Keep your heads down!

168
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,312
Fuck.

169
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,448
Go, go, go!
Shoot the tires!

170
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:10,817
Don't you fucking move!

171
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:13,252
Come on!

172
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:15,454
Come on, let's go!
Get in!

173
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:25,432
Fuck!

174
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:29,268
We fucking did it!
Holy fuck! Holy fuck!

175
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:31,437
Yeah!

176
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,856
Zillah?

177
00:09:49,857 --> 00:09:50,589
- Hi.
- Hey.

178
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,792
Oh, my God, are you okay?

179
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:56,396
Yeah, no,
just a dye pack exploded.

180
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:00,367
Hey, I can't stay long,
I gotta get home.

181
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,837
What is that?

182
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:06,573
Take a look.

183
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:16,049
Look in the other one, too.

184
00:10:20,888 --> 00:10:22,521
Oh, my God.

185
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,428
How much is this?

186
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,903
He wants you to stay.

187
00:10:36,904 --> 00:10:38,237
Yeah?

188
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:39,238
Want me to stay?

189
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,206
Yeah.

190
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,842
That's what he sounds like.

191
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,416
Morning.

192
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:51,718
Agent Husk.

193
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:56,089
Thank you.

194
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,025
Brought you boys some donuts.

195
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:00,460
Sheriff here?

196
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,233
Sheriff Loftlin...

197
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:09,235
Terry Husk.

198
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:13,005
I was surprised
to get your call.

199
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,841
Bureau hasn't
had a man in that office

200
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:15,875
for some time...

201
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:17,243
So I hear.

202
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:18,378
...let alone
one with your record.

203
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,449
KKK, Cosa Nostra?

204
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,252
Afraid you might
find this place boring.

205
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:28,454
Yeah,

206
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:30,389
that's the hope.

207
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,891
The only real crime
around here

208
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:33,559
is catching trout
without a license.

209
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:38,130
You know, you should
come over for dinner sometime.

210
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:40,199
We cook up a mean barbecue.

211
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,400
We'd love to have you.

212
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:43,970
When my family come in,
that'd be great.

213
00:11:43,971 --> 00:11:44,871
That'd be great.

214
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:47,106
- Thank you for that.
- Fantastic.

215
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:48,607
See ya.

216
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,309
I had a question
about some flyers

217
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,712
I keep seeing stuck up
around town.

218
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:57,216
White power, all that.

219
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,152
Is that the Aryan Nation?

220
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:03,423
Richard Butler
behaving himself?

221
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:06,325
How far is his compound
from here?

222
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:08,227
It's a long way up.

223
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,797
It's up by Hayden Lake.

224
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:13,499
It's not too far from here.

225
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,001
Oh yeah? How far?

226
00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:18,971
15, 20 minutes' drive.

227
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:19,972
Just there.

228
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:22,141
Well, thank you, Jamie.

229
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:24,076
Appreciate your help.

230
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,445
Get back to work.

231
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:29,448
Yes, sir.

232
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:31,417
Look, I'll admit,

233
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,519
Butler's church is a nuisance,

234
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,587
but they mostly
keep to themselves.

235
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:39,026
No use poking the bear, right?

236
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:43,063
You catch bigger fish
in the river.

237
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:47,567
Have a good day.

238
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:52,171
Hey, you mind if I bum
one of those?

239
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:53,205
Left mine in the car.

240
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:55,007
You fucking shits.

241
00:12:58,045 --> 00:13:00,346
Have a good day.

242
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:09,656
Excuse me, sir.

243
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:14,193
You left this.

244
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:16,062
My dad was in the Corps.

245
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:17,163
I'm Jamie, by the way.

246
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:19,967
I mean, Deputy Bowen.

247
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:24,670
- So, um...
- What?

248
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:28,407
So you were asking about
Hayden Lake, right?

249
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:31,410
You know
those pamphlets you saw?

250
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:33,246
That's not all they're printing.

251
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,725
Hey, my man.

252
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:48,327
Ah!

253
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,228
How you doin' today, huh?

254
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:52,031
How was school?

255
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:53,099
Can you say hello to this guy?

256
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,666
Can you say,
"Nice to meet you"?

257
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,035
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

258
00:13:58,505 --> 00:13:59,738
This is, uh, Agent Husk.

259
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:01,373
- Hi. Terry.
- Kimmy.

260
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:02,109
- That's my wife.
- Kimmy, hi.

261
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:07,513
They're using their press
to print counterfeit bills.

262
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:08,614
Where'd you get this?

263
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:09,748
From a friend.

264
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:11,550
His name's Walter West.

265
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:13,886
This guy I grew up with.
That's him.

266
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:15,054
He's a member
of the Aryan Nation?

267
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:17,623
Yeah, we went
to high school together,

268
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:19,258
and a few weeks back,

269
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:20,459
I ran into him at a bar,

270
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,760
and he was pretty loaded up,

271
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:23,295
you know, running his mouth,

272
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:24,931
and he showed me that,

273
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:27,266
and he said,
"That's just the beginning."

274
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:28,100
The beginning of what?

275
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:30,736
So, this was in June.

276
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:33,072
A bomb went off
at a synagogue in Boise,

277
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:35,874
and then in Spokane in October,

278
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,077
these porn stores got robbed,

279
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:39,445
and then you heard about
the bank that got hit

280
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:41,547
just up the road?

281
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:42,781
Walter says
the Nation's involved?

282
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:45,284
He says
they've gotten into explosives,

283
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:47,154
and that they're raising
a war chest for something.

284
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,023
Where's Walter now?

285
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:53,993
He's been missing
for two weeks.

286
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:56,095
You checking in on the family?

287
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:58,397
I called his wife, Bonnie Sue.

288
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,532
She hasn't seen him either,

289
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:04,803
but she doesn't want
to file a report.

290
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:07,773
You think the Bureau
would take a look at this?

291
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:11,643
In my experience,
hate groups don't rob banks.

292
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:13,246
What if it's different
this time?

293
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:24,791
Whoo!

294
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:29,328
Well, some of the guys
got excited.

295
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:30,329
Little celebration.

296
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,264
Put it out.

297
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,967
It's not a pageant.

298
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:37,937
All right, Bob,
I'll put it out.

299
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:44,876
Hey, hey,

300
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:46,512
no more of that cross burning.

301
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:47,980
We don't want
the attention, okay?

302
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:49,281
Yeah.

303
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,683
There's almost at least
50 grand in here.

304
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,152
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

305
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:55,154
Give every man five
as their salary.

306
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:56,322
What do you want to do
with the rest?

307
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:57,356
A tithe for the cause.

308
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:58,290
Are you Sam?

309
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,458
That's me.

310
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,227
I appreciate you
making the trip.

311
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:02,461
I'm Bob Mathews.

312
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,363
David told me
you had an operation here.

313
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:06,065
I didn't expect all this.

314
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:08,134
It's a start.

315
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:09,668
What else did Lane tell you?

316
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:10,869
That you're building
a militia,

317
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,538
needed someone to train 'em.

318
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:13,572
Mm-hmm.

319
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:14,540
He said you're the best.

320
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:15,541
That's right.

321
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:17,543
Got access to weapons?

322
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:18,910
I can get whatever you need,

323
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:20,812
but why?

324
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,315
You guys gonna
actually do something?

325
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,517
We already are.

326
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:28,087
How's $1,000 a month sound?

327
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:31,090
It's hard for an honest man
to make this in our country.

328
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:32,591
Yeah.

329
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,660
That's because
it's not our country anymore.

330
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:35,461
You're fucking right
about that.

331
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:38,197
You know, in every revolution,

332
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:40,599
someone has to fire
the first shot.

333
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,700
Want to help us do it?

334
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:43,835
Yes, I do.

335
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,072
Plenty more
where that came from.

336
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:47,040
Welcome.

337
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,484
Where you been?

338
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,786
Where's Clinton?

339
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:02,388
Uh, I just got him to bed.

340
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:03,355
He was asking for you.

341
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,457
Oh, yeah?

342
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:08,794
Mm.

343
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:10,529
What's all that?

344
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:13,132
It's a surprise for you.

345
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:14,200
Bob...

346
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:15,868
Open it up.

347
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:27,746
Bob...

348
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:28,814
What is this?

349
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:29,815
Wh-what--

350
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:31,818
It's for you, for our future.

351
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,156
Where... where did you get it?

352
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,460
Hi, Daddy.

353
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:43,061
Hey!

354
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,196
Oh, I'm sorry, buddy,

355
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:45,997
did I wake you up?

356
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,299
Hey.

357
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,767
Hey, come here. Hi.

358
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:50,769
Let's get you back to bed.

359
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,872
I told the guys they could
come by for some food.

360
00:17:57,544 --> 00:17:58,845
"The Turner Diaries."

361
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:03,415
See the picture?

362
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,450
Yeah.

363
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:05,584
That's Earl Turner...

364
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,153
Okay.

365
00:18:07,154 --> 00:18:09,921
...and he's hiking up
through the mountains there.

366
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,657
He's trying to
get out of the cities.

367
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:13,625
Where's he going?

368
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:14,760
Where's he going?

369
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:15,761
He's looking for
somewhere like this,

370
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:19,366
like where we live.

371
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:22,701
"My name is Evan,

372
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:24,136
and if you're reading
these pages,

373
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:26,172
then it means that I am gone.

374
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:27,706
My adventure
has been harrowing,

375
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:29,708
but I hope my story
will inspire you

376
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,109
to see that change only comes

377
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,612
when people are ready
to fight for it.

378
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,548
Chapter One. The Beginning.

379
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:39,518
The woods in the valley
were wet from the thaw..."

380
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,650
Give him a round, Don.

381
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,819
How does it feel
having to call me for help?

382
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,921
Don't you look
so happy about it.

383
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:17,490
Oh, I'm delighted.

384
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:24,863
I did hear about your scare
in New York.

385
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:26,532
How you feeling?

386
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:28,567
Old. Trying to slow down.

387
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:30,936
All right, so you're gonna
slow down. Then what?

388
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:33,939
I'm gonna find a nice place,

389
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:38,577
have Molly and the girls
move out here,

390
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:42,781
start... putting the pieces
back together.

391
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:45,551
Terry... You forget who
you're fucking talking to?

392
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:47,085
What?

393
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:48,787
You're gonna put the pieces
back together?

394
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:51,189
That's what you're going to do?

395
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,028
Oh, I've missed you, Terry.

396
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:04,970
Why'd you call me
about this case?

397
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:06,438
What you got?

398
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:08,240
I got nothing, Terry.
What do you want me to tell you?

399
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:10,310
Indulge me.

400
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:15,747
Three armored men, the driver,

401
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:16,948
all white guys, nondescript.

402
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,717
No security cameras inside?

403
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,151
No.

404
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:22,721
They dumped the car
at a dentist's office nearby.

405
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:26,157
No prints, nothing in it,

406
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:28,494
bought a car
off the classifieds for $500.

407
00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:30,662
So they're patient,
they've been waiting.

408
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:32,998
Yeah, they planned it.

409
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:34,300
Took nearly 45 grand.

410
00:20:34,301 --> 00:20:35,667
Anybody you like for it?

411
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:36,968
No, you?

412
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,937
Well, there's a kid
in the Sheriff's office

413
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:40,171
thinks it might be
the Aryan Nation.

414
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,507
Does that track with you?

415
00:20:41,508 --> 00:20:43,342
Not particularly, no.

416
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:44,910
Eh...

417
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:46,077
No.

418
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,681
So, this is you
slowing down, huh?

419
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:54,354
What about explosives?

420
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:01,259
We found a bomb at a porn shop

421
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,663
a couple days after the bank,

422
00:21:04,664 --> 00:21:05,631
but it never went off.

423
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:07,666
The triggering device
was mis-wired.

424
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:11,803
Why are you asking me
about explosives, Terry?

425
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:14,340
It's good to see you.

426
00:21:14,341 --> 00:21:16,476
Fuck you.

427
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:20,712
How well do you know
this Bonnie Sue?

428
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:21,880
She's a nice girl.

429
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:23,315
Went to high school together.

430
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:24,483
If she doesn't want to talk,

431
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:28,119
remind her you're a friend.

432
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,368
Uncle Randy?

433
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:43,369
Yes.

434
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,003
Do you remember me?
Jamie Bowen.

435
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:46,204
Oh, yes.

436
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:47,273
Is Bonnie Sue inside?

437
00:21:48,608 --> 00:21:49,908
Hey, can we talk?

438
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:51,143
Is he dead?

439
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,579
Why would you say that?

440
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,347
Deputy Bowen said

441
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:58,316
you called to file a report
of Walter missing,

442
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,885
but you never came in.

443
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:00,819
Why'd you change your mind?

444
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,920
Huh?

445
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:03,389
He's a drunk.

446
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,390
And?

447
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:06,157
He runs off.

448
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,058
It's not the first time
that happened.

449
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,094
When was
the last time you saw him?

450
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:12,564
I guess three weeks now.

451
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:16,034
He went off with some guys
and he didn't show--

452
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:17,035
What guys?

453
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:19,771
Who was he with?

454
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:22,108
Names. Who are you hiding?

455
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:24,610
Who are you protecting?

456
00:22:24,611 --> 00:22:25,544
What the fuck?

457
00:22:25,545 --> 00:22:27,078
I'm sorry, Bonnie.

458
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,680
Bonnie, wait.

459
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,181
Wait! Wait a minute.

460
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,850
Hey, wait a minute.

461
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:32,984
What the fuck?

462
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:36,355
I don't know that guy, okay?
I'm sorry.

463
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:52,303
Thought it was funny
that you joined the police.

464
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:54,173
Why?

465
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:56,809
Because you were different.

466
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:00,513
You were nice.

467
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:10,590
Aw... shit.

468
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:14,826
He was with Gary and Bruce.

469
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:18,096
Bruce? Bruce Pierce?

470
00:23:18,097 --> 00:23:19,498
Yeah, I told him
he shouldn't go.

471
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:21,633
I didn't think he'd be safe.

472
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:24,135
Do you think
he fucking listened to me?

473
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:25,538
Why didn't you think
he'd be safe?

474
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,342
Walt had a big mouth.

475
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,181
What was he talking about?

476
00:23:36,182 --> 00:23:37,649
How Bruce and that crew

477
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,452
were trying to recruit
for their group.

478
00:23:40,453 --> 00:23:41,286
Crew?

479
00:23:41,287 --> 00:23:43,154
You mean the Aryan Nation?

480
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,956
This was different.

481
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:46,525
It had a name.

482
00:23:46,526 --> 00:23:48,595
You know
where they were headed?

483
00:23:51,197 --> 00:23:53,399
He said they were
going hunting.

484
00:23:55,835 --> 00:23:57,536
Walter took his gun.

485
00:23:57,537 --> 00:23:58,871
Where?

486
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:05,144
Bruce's place?

487
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:11,049
I'm sorry.

488
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:21,126
You know
not everybody around here

489
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:24,896
is born under
a white bedsheet, right?

490
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:26,297
I know you were trying to pull

491
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:30,068
some bullshit
good cop, bad cop tactic,

492
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:32,238
but you didn't have to be
such a prick about it.

493
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,307
It worked.

494
00:25:50,617 --> 00:25:52,384
Here.

495
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,281
Careful.

496
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:01,420
Oh, shit...

497
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,429
That Walt?

498
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:15,901
That him?

499
00:27:15,902 --> 00:27:16,936
Yeah.

500
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:36,789
I guess we take it from here.

501
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,092
Whatever you need.

502
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:47,833
You want to show me
Hayden Lake?

503
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:08,787
Reverend Butler will see you.

504
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:10,021
I'll show you where we're going.

505
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:44,222
We appreciate
you coming by, Agent Husk.

506
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:46,657
Not everyone in your profession

507
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:50,128
is open to participate
in civil discussion.

508
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:52,297
You see, the Church
of Jesus Christ Christian

509
00:28:52,298 --> 00:28:55,767
is a place where all white men
like yourselves

510
00:28:55,768 --> 00:28:59,404
come and take ahold
of their history,

511
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:02,107
a piece of their future.

512
00:29:02,108 --> 00:29:05,510
We believe Christian whites
deserve a white homeland,

513
00:29:05,511 --> 00:29:07,678
but we don't advocate
any of our members

514
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,482
breaking any laws to achieve it.

515
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:13,985
But some do.

516
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:15,854
Well,
you must understand that,

517
00:29:15,855 --> 00:29:18,123
being in a cult

518
00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:21,593
like the federal government.

519
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:24,563
Any idea...

520
00:29:27,066 --> 00:29:28,935
where they are?

521
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:32,637
No, I do not.

522
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:35,373
Gary and Bruce
are avaricious young men

523
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:36,842
who lost all self-control,

524
00:29:36,843 --> 00:29:40,111
and are no longer
a part of this congregation.

525
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:44,115
Mr. Bentley saw to it
personally.

526
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:45,283
And why was that?

527
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,218
Heard they were using our press

528
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:48,686
to print counterfeit currency,

529
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:50,655
so we asked them to leave.

530
00:29:50,656 --> 00:29:52,591
Why are you looking for them?

531
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:01,833
You knew him, huh?

532
00:30:01,834 --> 00:30:04,569
Walter.

533
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,537
So, we've heard
strays from your church

534
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:08,539
are splintering off,

535
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:12,343
forming their own groups,

536
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:14,913
and they're getting powerful.

537
00:30:14,914 --> 00:30:18,449
And you're worried
Gary and Bruce are responsible.

538
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:21,052
Well, if I were you,
I'd be worried too,

539
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:22,588
because they get a taste
for power.

540
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,058
Get control of your strays.

541
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:30,028
Hmm?

542
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:32,031
Or this won't
be your flock anymore.

543
00:30:33,632 --> 00:30:35,901
I don't know where they are,

544
00:30:35,902 --> 00:30:38,604
but if I hear, I will call.

545
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,809
I appreciate your time.

546
00:30:47,246 --> 00:30:49,014
What's that book?

547
00:30:49,015 --> 00:30:52,083
It's a book of fiction

548
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:53,819
for the children.

549
00:31:00,993 --> 00:31:03,295
You should read it
sometime, son.

550
00:31:06,132 --> 00:31:07,633
Thank you.

551
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:21,379
Hey, Connie, Connie!

552
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,613
Let me take Krista.

553
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:23,949
Bob needs her for the ceremony.
- No.

554
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,416
Hey, Krista, you want to be
in the ceremony, sweetie?

555
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:26,884
No, it's an honor.
Bob said it's an honor.

556
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,219
- You'll wake her up.
- You want to come, Krista?

557
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,254
Do not wake her up!

558
00:31:29,255 --> 00:31:31,456
Bob, it's Tony Torres.

559
00:31:31,457 --> 00:31:32,490
Tony. Good to meet you.

560
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:33,925
Hey, nice to meet you.

561
00:31:33,926 --> 00:31:34,692
I'm Bob.

562
00:31:34,693 --> 00:31:37,095
"Torres."
Is that Mexican?

563
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:38,429
No, it's--

564
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,230
No, no, no, no, it's Spanish.

565
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,466
It's actually "Taurus,"

566
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:43,268
like a bull.

567
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:45,836
Yeah, we're Spanish.

568
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:48,773
We're white, pure European.

569
00:31:48,774 --> 00:31:50,608
I'm not a Mexican.

570
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:53,911
Tell me about yourself.

571
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,313
I heard you were having
some trouble in Seattle.

572
00:31:55,314 --> 00:31:58,316
Well, a bunch of spooks
took his job.

573
00:31:58,317 --> 00:32:00,418
I'm sorry to hear that.

574
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,587
David mentioned what...

575
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:05,057
happened when you were a kid.

576
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:09,928
Do you mind if you share it
with these guys?

577
00:32:13,065 --> 00:32:15,633
This spook
killed my best friend,

578
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:18,536
walked right up to him
after school,

579
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:22,340
and just...

580
00:32:22,341 --> 00:32:25,010
Shot him?

581
00:32:25,011 --> 00:32:26,777
Mm-hmm.

582
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,915
How'd that make you feel?

583
00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:36,687
I don't know what to tell.

584
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:40,891
I was lost.

585
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:43,461
I never went back to school.

586
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:47,865
I never got my diploma.

587
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:50,568
No diploma makes it hard
to find honest work,

588
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:51,702
and then you fall off, right?

589
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:54,572
I'm sorry, it's not fair,

590
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:57,075
and it's not your fault,

591
00:32:57,076 --> 00:32:59,877
but...

592
00:32:59,878 --> 00:33:01,479
it's going to be okay.

593
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,049
There's a salary here for you,

594
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:05,516
and friends,

595
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:07,819
family, okay?

596
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:12,423
You want to come join us?

597
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:13,324
I do.

598
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:14,392
Welcome.

599
00:33:14,393 --> 00:33:15,660
Thank you.

600
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:16,862
Thanks, Bob.
- Make yourself at home.

601
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,264
- Thank you.
- Sam.

602
00:33:19,265 --> 00:33:20,731
Hey, Sam.
Nice to meet you. Tony.

603
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,667
- Tony, hey.
- Gary.

604
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:24,102
- Gary.
- Hey, Tony, welcome...

605
00:33:24,103 --> 00:33:26,737
I, as a free Aryan man,

606
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:29,074
hereby swear an unrelenting oath

607
00:33:29,075 --> 00:33:32,610
upon the children
in the wombs of our wives

608
00:33:32,611 --> 00:33:34,679
to join together

609
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,049
with those brothers
in this circle,

610
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,717
for we are now
in a full state of war,

611
00:33:39,718 --> 00:33:41,052
and will not lay down
our weapons

612
00:33:41,053 --> 00:33:44,622
until we have driven the enemy
into the sea.

613
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:48,726
It is time to reclaim the land

614
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:51,429
which was promised
to our fathers,

615
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:53,764
and through our blood

616
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:55,866
and His will,

617
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:59,704
let it become the land
of our children to be.

618
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:01,439
May God protect us.

619
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,573
Amen.

620
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:08,446
You guys
will hang them up to dry.

621
00:34:08,447 --> 00:34:11,350
They always gotta end up
in here, Tony.

622
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:17,022
Grab a handful.

623
00:34:22,128 --> 00:34:24,329
You've gotta separate out
all the bills, all right?

624
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:26,164
10s, 20s, fives.

625
00:34:26,165 --> 00:34:27,832
Gotta be in batches of 50,

626
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:30,601
and then throw
the rubber bands on 'em.

627
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:31,903
One more thing.

628
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:39,110
Bob wanted you to have this.

629
00:34:39,111 --> 00:34:40,412
Come on.

630
00:34:41,847 --> 00:34:43,181
Seriously?

631
00:34:43,182 --> 00:34:44,149
He wanted me to have this?

632
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,450
Yup.

633
00:34:45,451 --> 00:34:47,685
You're one of us now.

634
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:49,019
Okay.

635
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,889
You did all right.

636
00:35:21,587 --> 00:35:24,956
Son, I've warned you before.

637
00:35:26,558 --> 00:35:28,927
You are playing with fire.

638
00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:33,731
Robert, you have a gift,

639
00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:35,366
a voice...

640
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:37,968
Thank you, sir.

641
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,671
...but do not go down this path.

642
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:43,308
We're not thieves.

643
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:45,243
You're drawing
too much attention.

644
00:35:45,244 --> 00:35:45,843
From whom?

645
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:48,646
The FBI.

646
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:49,948
They found Walter's body.

647
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:54,286
We seek the same goals.

648
00:35:55,954 --> 00:35:58,823
In 10 years, we'll have members
in the Congress, the Senate.

649
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:01,526
That's how you make change,

650
00:36:01,527 --> 00:36:02,527
but progress takes time.

651
00:36:02,528 --> 00:36:03,828
That's your problem.

652
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:05,230
You're running out of time,

653
00:36:05,231 --> 00:36:07,698
and you've got nothing
to show for it.

654
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:09,834
Nothing.

655
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:12,337
You preach racial economics.

656
00:36:12,338 --> 00:36:13,539
We live it.

657
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:17,675
I'm not going to be you.

658
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,378
You stand down, Robert.

659
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:25,617
Or what?

660
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:04,489
Find out
what they're up to next.

661
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:08,026
We need to clip
that boy's wings.

662
00:37:27,346 --> 00:37:28,346
Hey, hey.

663
00:37:28,347 --> 00:37:30,180
Hey, buddy.

664
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:32,283
- How you doing?
- Good.

665
00:37:32,284 --> 00:37:33,418
Hey, Jamie,

666
00:37:33,419 --> 00:37:37,088
this guy outside
brought this for you.

667
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,524
What is it?

668
00:37:39,525 --> 00:37:40,591
When?

669
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:41,460
Just right now.

670
00:37:43,362 --> 00:37:44,462
Jamie...

671
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:52,270
Hey! Hey!

672
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:56,206
Is this lead solid?

673
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:57,875
Yeah, it's solid.

674
00:37:57,876 --> 00:37:59,444
Who the fuck is he?

675
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:00,378
Hello, ma'am,
my name is Deputy Bowen.

676
00:38:00,379 --> 00:38:01,479
He's the one I said
put us onto 'em.

677
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,647
Put us on?

678
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:04,048
What the fuck
you bring him here for?

679
00:38:04,049 --> 00:38:05,215
You bringing dates
to the party now?

680
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:07,985
Stay behind. I got the lead.

681
00:38:19,565 --> 00:38:20,831
Who is it?

682
00:38:20,832 --> 00:38:22,467
-  FBI!
-  Back up!

683
00:38:22,468 --> 00:38:23,368
- Back up!
- Show me your hands!

684
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:24,669
Move, move!

685
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,670
Keep your hands
where I can see them!

686
00:38:25,671 --> 00:38:26,504
Have you seen this man,
Gary Yarborough?

687
00:38:26,505 --> 00:38:27,572
Ma'am?

688
00:38:27,573 --> 00:38:29,641
He just left.

689
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:31,709
Who else is in the house?

690
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:32,743
No, just me.

691
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:34,044
Turn around, ma'am.

692
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:34,845
He rented
my daughter's room

693
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:36,246
for two weeks.

694
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:37,314
He was with some friends,
real nice boys--

695
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,684
Carney!

696
00:38:42,287 --> 00:38:43,522
Shit.

697
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,526
Okay, Carlos.

698
00:39:21,527 --> 00:39:23,060
It's done.

699
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:25,430
All clear to go.

700
00:39:25,431 --> 00:39:26,731
Okay, copy.

701
00:39:26,732 --> 00:39:27,566
That's our window.

702
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:29,367
They should be coming out now.

703
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,206
All bomb squad units,

704
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:39,209
bomb squad units,
you are to respond ASAP,

705
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,211
1409 3rd Street,
Embassy Theater.

706
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,447
There's no report yet
of numbers.

707
00:39:42,448 --> 00:39:43,714
We're en route.

708
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:44,815
Copy that. Thank you.

709
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:46,384
They're not there.
It's a distraction.

710
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:55,493
Open the fucking door!

711
00:39:55,494 --> 00:39:56,326
What the--

712
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:57,127
You hear me, motherfucker?

713
00:40:00,499 --> 00:40:02,332
- Open it now!
- Open the door!

714
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,001
Open the fucking door!

715
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:06,003
Get out!

716
00:40:06,004 --> 00:40:07,738
Back the fuck away! Now!

717
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,840
Die, you motherfucker!

718
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:11,942
I said back the fuck up!

719
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:13,343
Make me do it, you--

720
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:14,945
Drop your fucking--

721
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:16,747
Shit!

722
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:21,285
- Get out now! Move!
- Okay, okay!

723
00:40:21,286 --> 00:40:22,587
- Don't make me kill you!
- Okay, okay!

724
00:40:22,588 --> 00:40:23,854
- I'm coming! I'm coming!
- Get out! Move, move, move!

725
00:40:23,855 --> 00:40:24,855
Don't shoot!

726
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:25,956
Get on the fucking ground!

727
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:27,124
Let's go!

728
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,659
Get the fuck down!

729
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,327
- Don't look at me!
- Don't you fucking move!

730
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:31,596
Any available units,

731
00:40:31,597 --> 00:40:33,430
we've got a 2-1-1 in progress.

732
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:34,331
Please respond to the south side
of Northgate Mall.

733
00:40:34,332 --> 00:40:36,033
Yup, there it is.

734
00:40:36,034 --> 00:40:37,702
Shit!

735
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:52,850
Terry, proceed to the Embassy!

736
00:40:52,851 --> 00:40:54,419
Negative.

737
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:57,622
There's a man in the lobby
with a machine gun!

738
00:40:57,623 --> 00:40:59,389
If you move
before the police get here,

739
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,958
he will shoot your head off!

740
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,392
Don't fucking move, bitch!

741
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:03,828
The bags!
Money, money! Let's go!

742
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:05,830
Fast, fast! Let's go!

743
00:41:05,831 --> 00:41:07,131
Get it in the trunk!

744
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:08,866
Go, go, go! Move, move!

745
00:41:08,867 --> 00:41:10,400
Don't you fucking move!

746
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:12,337
Move, and I'll blow
your fucking head off!

747
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,507
There. There they are.

748
00:41:16,508 --> 00:41:17,975
Oh, shit.

749
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:19,277
Last one.

750
00:41:24,182 --> 00:41:25,550
You cover me. Come on.

751
00:41:25,551 --> 00:41:26,918
Go, go, go!

752
00:41:28,086 --> 00:41:29,187
Come on!

753
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:32,791
Fuck... Fucking go.

754
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:46,638
I got him, Bob.

755
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:15,065
Fucking hear me?

756
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:17,067
Did you fucking hear me?

757
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:18,636
You fucker!

758
00:42:18,637 --> 00:42:20,137
Did you hear me?

759
00:42:20,138 --> 00:42:21,238
I'm sorry.

760
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:23,040
Huh? You hear what I said?

761
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,642
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck.

762
00:42:24,643 --> 00:42:25,610
I'm sorry.

763
00:42:25,611 --> 00:42:28,278
Fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck!

764
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:29,814
Cocksucker!

765
00:42:29,815 --> 00:42:32,049
Fuck me, man.

766
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:36,487
All right.

767
00:42:53,371 --> 00:42:55,505
Shot of whiskey.

768
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:56,374
For him, too.

769
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,948
Terry, I don't know
what happened, I just--

770
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:06,016
You get one pass.

771
00:43:06,017 --> 00:43:08,285
That was it.

772
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,524
Next time I say move,
fucking move.

773
00:43:17,896 --> 00:43:19,029
What a fucking
shit show that was.

774
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,530
You find the cars?

775
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:22,299
Don't ever fucking
do that shit to me again.

776
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,868
You're not in lead
anymore, Terry.

777
00:43:23,869 --> 00:43:25,335
You don't get to run off
on your own

778
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:26,436
without fucking
telling me first!

779
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:27,537
- There wasn't time.
- There wasn't time?

780
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:28,973
Bullshit.
- I was with Jamie.

781
00:43:28,974 --> 00:43:30,074
You were with Jamie?

782
00:43:30,075 --> 00:43:31,676
Well, how'd that fucking
work out for you, huh?

783
00:43:31,677 --> 00:43:34,779
Considering you motherfuckers
let the target get away.

784
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,213
- Did you find the cars?
- Now they dumped the cars

785
00:43:36,214 --> 00:43:38,048
in a lot, there's no prints.

786
00:43:38,049 --> 00:43:39,616
They wiped them down,

787
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:40,718
because they had plenty
of fucking time to do it.

788
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:41,852
They had a shot on me
and they didn't take it.

789
00:43:41,853 --> 00:43:42,987
- They pointed a MAC-10.
- They had a shot.

790
00:43:42,988 --> 00:43:44,188
Oh, really?
Well, where were you?

791
00:43:44,189 --> 00:43:45,122
They didn't take it. Why not?

792
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:46,290
They don't want to kill a Fed.

793
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:47,157
They have a plan.

794
00:43:47,158 --> 00:43:48,492
They bought the cars

795
00:43:48,493 --> 00:43:50,027
from classifieds again.

796
00:43:50,028 --> 00:43:51,328
- Yeah.
- Paid cash.

797
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:52,229
Of course there's no prints.

798
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:53,731
They got a plan.

799
00:43:53,732 --> 00:43:55,232
They bomb porn stores,
they bomb...

800
00:43:55,233 --> 00:43:56,533
- Terry.
- ...a synagogue.

801
00:43:56,534 --> 00:43:59,403
Terry, your nose is bleeding.
Excuse me.

802
00:43:59,404 --> 00:44:00,805
-  Goddamn it, Terry.
-  Can we get a napkin?

803
00:44:00,806 --> 00:44:02,306
What did they get,
quarter of a million?

804
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:03,741
That's a fucking
war chest right there. For what?

805
00:44:03,742 --> 00:44:05,509
Wipe your fucking nose.

806
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:07,211
You're supposed to put
your head back, Terry.

807
00:44:07,212 --> 00:44:08,813
I know. It's the fucking pills.

808
00:44:08,814 --> 00:44:09,847
I'm fine.

809
00:44:09,848 --> 00:44:12,617
Go home, Terry.

810
00:44:14,419 --> 00:44:16,821
Go back to Idaho.

811
00:44:16,822 --> 00:44:17,955
You said you wanted
to slow down.

812
00:44:17,956 --> 00:44:18,923
Well, slow the fuck down.

813
00:44:18,924 --> 00:44:19,990
I am slowing down.

814
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:21,492
No, you are not.

815
00:44:23,561 --> 00:44:24,729
Is that an order?

816
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:26,664
Yes.

817
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:02,733
We're sorry.

818
00:45:02,734 --> 00:45:04,869
You have reached a number
that has been disconnected

819
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:06,804
or is no longer in service.

820
00:45:06,805 --> 00:45:09,073
If you feel you have reached
this recording in error,

821
00:45:09,074 --> 00:45:10,140
please check the number

822
00:45:10,141 --> 00:45:13,077
and try your call again.

823
00:47:37,122 --> 00:47:39,223
Smoke?

824
00:47:39,224 --> 00:47:41,026
No, thank you, sir.

825
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:45,262
No luck, huh?

826
00:47:45,263 --> 00:47:47,597
Not today.

827
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:49,066
They must be hiding.

828
00:47:49,067 --> 00:47:50,100
Yeah.

829
00:47:51,136 --> 00:47:54,071
Maybe it's the smoke.

830
00:47:54,072 --> 00:47:55,605
To what?

831
00:47:55,606 --> 00:47:56,974
They like the fresh air.

832
00:47:56,975 --> 00:47:58,643
They smell you coming for miles.

833
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:02,412
That so?

834
00:48:02,413 --> 00:48:03,547
Mm-hmm.

835
00:48:03,548 --> 00:48:04,614
Hmm.

836
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:06,483
Do you live near here?

837
00:48:06,484 --> 00:48:09,419
Yeah, pretty close.

838
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:11,488
You're not from here, huh?

839
00:48:11,489 --> 00:48:12,857
I'm new.

840
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:21,831
You following me?

841
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:24,735
Yeah, it looked like
you could use some help.

842
00:48:34,712 --> 00:48:37,147
Have a good night.

843
00:48:37,148 --> 00:48:38,016
You too.

844
00:48:47,892 --> 00:48:50,294
It is my great honor
to introduce to you

845
00:48:50,295 --> 00:48:52,329
a leader that has done
yeoman's work

846
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:54,264
to bring us deliverance,

847
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:56,466
Reverend Richard Butler.

848
00:49:09,747 --> 00:49:12,882
This book

849
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:16,887
holds our birthright...

850
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:22,259
but it is not one
taught in our schools,

851
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:27,297
by our elected officials.

852
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:29,699
The Promised Land

853
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,502
is not for the Jews...

854
00:49:33,504 --> 00:49:37,307
...but for the true
Israelites,

855
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:38,208
the Caucasians...

856
00:49:38,209 --> 00:49:40,310
Yes!

857
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:44,881
...and you deserve
to build that home now.

858
00:49:44,882 --> 00:49:47,417
Yeah! -That's right!

859
00:49:47,418 --> 00:49:48,918
Let me read you

860
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:53,723
from Zechariah, chapter ten.

861
00:50:11,809 --> 00:50:14,511
Yes, Robert?

862
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:17,182
Do you have something to say?

863
00:50:25,123 --> 00:50:26,623
Good morning, my brothers...

864
00:50:26,624 --> 00:50:27,724
Good morning.

865
00:50:27,725 --> 00:50:28,692
...sisters.

866
00:50:28,693 --> 00:50:29,827
Good morning.

867
00:50:31,429 --> 00:50:34,131
It's an honor
to be here with you.

868
00:50:34,132 --> 00:50:37,967
I'm proud.

869
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:39,203
If you're like me,

870
00:50:39,204 --> 00:50:42,972
I'm not sure
how much more talk I can hear,

871
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:45,375
because that's all it is,
isn't it?

872
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:48,846
Talk, talk, talk.

873
00:50:51,149 --> 00:50:53,583
Well, I, for one,
have had enough of just talk.

874
00:50:55,453 --> 00:51:00,390
Now, I know how you feel.

875
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:02,459
I do.

876
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,829
You've lost your jobs...

877
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:07,797
...your dignity.

878
00:51:09,667 --> 00:51:13,937
I watched my father
get knocked down

879
00:51:13,938 --> 00:51:17,741
again and again,

880
00:51:17,742 --> 00:51:22,246
and he never pushed back...

881
00:51:22,247 --> 00:51:26,150
and they'll tell you
that's how it works.

882
00:51:26,151 --> 00:51:30,487
You just have to stand there
and take it,

883
00:51:30,488 --> 00:51:33,523
one link at a time,

884
00:51:33,524 --> 00:51:36,993
one freedom at a time...

885
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:42,599
...but I won't do it.

886
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,635
It is time for us to fight.

887
00:51:45,636 --> 00:51:48,472
Yeah!

888
00:51:48,473 --> 00:51:49,606
My friends and family,

889
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:50,974
we're here with you today

890
00:51:50,975 --> 00:51:54,644
because we want you to join us
on a mission,

891
00:51:54,645 --> 00:51:58,948
putting words into action.

892
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,884
Yeah! Yeah!

893
00:52:00,885 --> 00:52:04,521
Our brotherhood
has broken the chains

894
00:52:04,522 --> 00:52:06,856
of Jewish thought

895
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:10,294
and parasitical usury.

896
00:52:10,295 --> 00:52:12,229
We've stood tall
against the coloreds

897
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:13,963
who have soured our lands.

898
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:16,366
We, these,
these yeoman farmers,

899
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:18,067
are eating, breathing,

900
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:21,471
sleeping, and growing together.

901
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:23,540
They've become one mind,

902
00:52:23,541 --> 00:52:25,074
one body...

903
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:27,377
One race,

904
00:52:27,378 --> 00:52:28,545
one army!

905
00:52:28,546 --> 00:52:30,214
Yeah!

906
00:52:30,215 --> 00:52:32,582
We're facing the extermination
of our history,

907
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:35,885
of our very way of life!

908
00:52:35,886 --> 00:52:37,387
Yeah!

909
00:52:37,388 --> 00:52:38,522
Will you sit back

910
00:52:38,523 --> 00:52:39,323
and allow the nation

911
00:52:39,324 --> 00:52:41,057
that our forefathers discovered,

912
00:52:41,058 --> 00:52:42,859
conquered, and died for

913
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,194
be eradicated,

914
00:52:44,195 --> 00:52:45,895
or will you stand up like men

915
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:47,431
and fight to survive?

916
00:52:47,432 --> 00:52:48,698
Yeah!

917
00:52:48,699 --> 00:52:50,334
Kinsmen, duty calls.

918
00:52:50,335 --> 00:52:52,902
It is time to take the future

919
00:52:52,903 --> 00:52:54,904
all your families deserve!

920
00:52:54,905 --> 00:52:57,907
Yes! Amen!

921
00:52:57,908 --> 00:53:00,710
In Metaline Falls,
we have a saying.

922
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:07,917
"Defeat...

923
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:09,085
never."

924
00:53:09,086 --> 00:53:11,721
Never...

925
00:53:11,722 --> 00:53:14,358
"Victory...

926
00:53:14,359 --> 00:53:15,124
forever."

927
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:18,295
Forever!

928
00:53:18,296 --> 00:53:19,128
Defeat...

929
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:21,231
Never!

930
00:53:21,232 --> 00:53:22,566
Victory...

931
00:53:22,567 --> 00:53:23,400
Forever!

932
00:53:23,401 --> 00:53:24,901
-  Defeat...
-  Never!

933
00:53:24,902 --> 00:53:26,135
-  Victory...
-  Forever!

934
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:27,437
-  Defeat...
-  Never!

935
00:53:27,438 --> 00:53:28,805
-  Victory...
-  Forever!

936
00:53:28,806 --> 00:53:30,139
-  Defeat...
-  Never!

937
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:31,775
Victory...
Forever!

938
00:53:31,776 --> 00:53:32,876
-  Defeat...
-  Never!

939
00:53:32,877 --> 00:53:33,743
-  Victory...
-  Forever!

940
00:53:33,744 --> 00:53:34,878
-  Defeat...
-  Never!

941
00:53:34,879 --> 00:53:35,912
-  Victory...
-  Forever!

942
00:53:35,913 --> 00:53:36,913
-  Defeat...
-  Never!

943
00:53:36,914 --> 00:53:39,082
Never! Never!

944
00:53:39,083 --> 00:53:43,253
White power!
White power!

945
00:53:43,254 --> 00:53:46,222
White power!
White power!

946
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:49,293
White power! White power!
White power! White power!

947
00:53:49,294 --> 00:53:51,928
White power!
White power! White power!

948
00:53:51,929 --> 00:53:53,797
White power! White power!
White--

949
00:53:57,402 --> 00:53:59,068
Musical chairs,
musical chairs!

950
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,770
Wanna play musical chairs?

951
00:54:00,771 --> 00:54:01,905
Musical chairs! Yeah!

952
00:54:01,906 --> 00:54:03,973
Everybody grab a chair,
grab a chair.

953
00:54:08,613 --> 00:54:10,580
So, I've been thinking
about these guys.

954
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:12,982
You know, it's obviously
not just a cash grab.

955
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:14,984
There's a method
to what they're doing.

956
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:16,520
You know, it's like,

957
00:54:16,521 --> 00:54:19,188
maybe it's building up
to something big, you know?

958
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:21,190
Bombing porn theaters
and synagogues,

959
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:22,826
it's organized, you know,

960
00:54:22,827 --> 00:54:24,961
and somebody's calling the shots
like a general--

961
00:54:24,962 --> 00:54:26,129
Hey, hate to break up
the pow-wow,

962
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:27,931
but I think these guys
are getting hungry.

963
00:54:27,932 --> 00:54:29,299
Should we light up the grill?

964
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,967
Yeah, yeah, I'll just cook
some of these hot dogs.

965
00:54:30,968 --> 00:54:32,370
Yeah.

966
00:54:36,574 --> 00:54:40,377
Must be hard
being away from yours, huh?

967
00:54:40,378 --> 00:54:41,945
Jamie said
you've got a daughter.

968
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:43,179
Two.

969
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:45,115
When are they coming up?

970
00:54:49,987 --> 00:54:51,287
Sorry, I wasn't trying to pry,
I just--

971
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:52,457
No, no.

972
00:54:57,562 --> 00:54:58,562
You two are good.

973
00:54:58,563 --> 00:55:00,398
Yeah.

974
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:05,201
How did you two meet?

975
00:55:05,202 --> 00:55:06,470
We met in school.

976
00:55:06,471 --> 00:55:08,972
Senior year.

977
00:55:08,973 --> 00:55:10,139
Hmm.

978
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:13,677
Married, had kids.

979
00:55:13,678 --> 00:55:15,979
I've spent my whole life
in this house.

980
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,581
Grandparents, parents.

981
00:55:17,582 --> 00:55:18,616
Yeah?

982
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:24,220
It's a generational house.

983
00:55:24,221 --> 00:55:25,589
Lot of love in here.

984
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:28,526
Yeah.

985
00:55:32,296 --> 00:55:36,232
There's something about
you coming in here,

986
00:55:36,233 --> 00:55:38,935
having these talks

987
00:55:38,936 --> 00:55:42,507
around the kids...

988
00:55:44,609 --> 00:55:46,711
I don't like that.

989
00:55:51,516 --> 00:55:54,118
You scare me.

990
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:01,425
All right, who's hungry?

991
00:56:01,426 --> 00:56:03,227
Me, me, me, me!

992
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:49,773
There's six steps in that book.

993
00:56:49,774 --> 00:56:52,809
Recruiting, fundraising,

994
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:54,578
armed revolution,

995
00:56:54,579 --> 00:56:57,280
domestic terror,

996
00:56:57,281 --> 00:56:58,749
assassination.

997
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,119
Number six
is "Day of the Rope."

998
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:04,488
Were you gonna tell me
about this?

999
00:57:04,489 --> 00:57:05,522
No.

1000
00:57:05,523 --> 00:57:07,323
Why not?

1001
00:57:07,324 --> 00:57:09,727
Because I didn't think
you'd take me seriously.

1002
00:57:11,228 --> 00:57:13,597
Well, I am now.

1003
00:57:25,242 --> 00:57:26,776
See,
I just want to know what to do

1004
00:57:26,777 --> 00:57:27,677
when I get to hell,

1005
00:57:27,678 --> 00:57:29,045
because apparently,
as you said,

1006
00:57:29,046 --> 00:57:30,980
all my friends are there!

1007
00:57:30,981 --> 00:57:32,616
So I just want to know
what I'm walking into.

1008
00:57:32,617 --> 00:57:33,883
See, there you go,
you're just a kike.

1009
00:57:33,884 --> 00:57:35,952
You don't get it,
'cause you're just a kike.

1010
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:37,621
You're making fun of something
that's sacred to Christians,

1011
00:57:37,622 --> 00:57:38,955
and you don't get it,
-  Oh, okay,

1012
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:40,690
that's it, make it a Jew thing.

1013
00:57:40,691 --> 00:57:42,191
Make it about Jews.

1014
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:43,993
What do you know about Jews?

1015
00:57:43,994 --> 00:57:45,328
Jews to you people

1016
00:57:45,329 --> 00:57:46,896
is some sort of
mythological creature,

1017
00:57:46,897 --> 00:57:48,998
some sort of beast.

1018
00:57:48,999 --> 00:57:51,134
You don't know anything
about the Jewish people.

1019
00:57:51,135 --> 00:57:53,903
It's just an easy target,

1020
00:57:53,904 --> 00:57:57,974
because you're too afraid
to see what's in yourself,

1021
00:57:57,975 --> 00:57:59,543
because you have
to have somebody to blame

1022
00:57:59,544 --> 00:58:00,844
for your life,

1023
00:58:00,845 --> 00:58:03,547
because you can't really
blame the people

1024
00:58:03,548 --> 00:58:06,683
that have put you
in the position that you're in,

1025
00:58:06,684 --> 00:58:11,187
whether it's a-a government
that doesn't care about you

1026
00:58:11,188 --> 00:58:12,221
and has taught you
to believe otherwise,

1027
00:58:12,222 --> 00:58:14,223
or it's something
within yourself--

1028
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:16,025
Step five right here.

1029
00:58:16,026 --> 00:58:17,561
you can't face yourself,
so it's the Jews...

1030
00:58:17,562 --> 00:58:19,729
Let me get him.

1031
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:20,697
...but the one thing
you believe...

1032
00:58:20,698 --> 00:58:22,599
Let me do it, Bob.

1033
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:25,935
...is that the only
really good Jew is a dead Jew,

1034
00:58:25,936 --> 00:58:30,006
and for some reason,
you think he cares about you.

1035
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:32,576
I hear this all the time.

1036
00:58:32,577 --> 00:58:33,943
People say things are dirty,

1037
00:58:33,944 --> 00:58:35,845
things are ugly,

1038
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:37,380
things are changing.

1039
00:58:37,381 --> 00:58:38,948
They don't like the new neighbor
on their street.

1040
00:58:38,949 --> 00:58:42,185
They don't like
the new synagogue in town,

1041
00:58:42,186 --> 00:58:44,788
and when you hear this all day,

1042
00:58:44,789 --> 00:58:47,891
you might think
we're so filled up with hate,

1043
00:58:47,892 --> 00:58:49,759
it's almost irreversible,

1044
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,862
but this may surprise you
coming from me,

1045
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:55,431
but I think people
are actually decent.

1046
00:58:55,432 --> 00:58:57,701
That's why they call in.

1047
00:58:57,702 --> 00:59:00,403
That's why they want to talk.

1048
00:59:00,404 --> 00:59:02,138
They want someone
to connect with.

1049
00:59:02,139 --> 00:59:04,808
I think people
want to give love.

1050
00:59:04,809 --> 00:59:07,644
They want to say,
"You're all right.

1051
00:59:07,645 --> 00:59:10,413
Let's sit, let's have a beer,"

1052
00:59:10,414 --> 00:59:13,416
but they're afraid
they won't get it back,

1053
00:59:13,417 --> 00:59:16,252
but I think our better instincts
will prevail,

1054
00:59:16,253 --> 00:59:19,188
but it's got to start somewhere.

1055
00:59:19,189 --> 00:59:23,492
So I encourage you
to do that tonight.

1056
00:59:23,493 --> 00:59:25,094
Put something good out there,

1057
00:59:25,095 --> 00:59:28,231
because our words, our ideas,

1058
00:59:28,232 --> 00:59:31,134
that's what's going to live on.

1059
00:59:31,135 --> 00:59:35,138
That's what matters, after all,

1060
00:59:35,139 --> 00:59:38,174
and that's all for me, folks.

1061
00:59:38,175 --> 00:59:41,811
This is Alan Berg, KOA Denver,

1062
00:59:41,812 --> 00:59:44,280
signing off.

1063
00:59:44,281 --> 00:59:46,350
Sayonara.

1064
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:36,165
Terry, open up.

1065
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:40,837
Fuck...

1066
01:00:47,044 --> 01:00:48,044
Shit, you're really

1067
01:00:48,045 --> 01:00:50,379
getting the place ready
for the family, huh?

1068
01:00:51,849 --> 01:00:54,084
What?

1069
01:00:57,054 --> 01:00:57,988
Oh, you haven't heard.

1070
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:04,461
They murdered Alan Berg.

1071
01:01:06,563 --> 01:01:08,197
Followed him home,
shot him 12 times,

1072
01:01:08,198 --> 01:01:11,000
34 wounds in all.

1073
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:14,203
What was the gun?

1074
01:01:14,204 --> 01:01:16,506
A MAC-10.

1075
01:01:19,109 --> 01:01:21,678
They butchered him
like he was a fucking animal.

1076
01:01:34,224 --> 01:01:35,925
Hey, everyone.

1077
01:01:35,926 --> 01:01:37,560
Uh, just want to say

1078
01:01:37,561 --> 01:01:40,229
thank you all for being here.

1079
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:42,565
You know, this just means a lot.

1080
01:01:42,566 --> 01:01:44,567
When we first
moved here, this...

1081
01:01:44,568 --> 01:01:47,603
this right here,
this was the dream, you know?

1082
01:01:47,604 --> 01:01:49,873
Kids playing, having fun,
a big family,

1083
01:01:49,874 --> 01:01:52,241
in nature.

1084
01:01:52,242 --> 01:01:53,009
This is what it's all about,

1085
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:54,243
so thank you for being here.

1086
01:01:54,244 --> 01:01:55,745
Thank you to God.

1087
01:01:55,746 --> 01:01:57,046
Um...

1088
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:58,714
let's have fun.

1089
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:02,051
God bless you, Bob.

1090
01:02:04,388 --> 01:02:05,789
See that beer bottle?

1091
01:02:05,790 --> 01:02:06,622
Yeah.

1092
01:02:06,623 --> 01:02:08,257
Okay, now line it up

1093
01:02:08,258 --> 01:02:10,259
through these sights, okay?

1094
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:12,328
Take a deep breath.

1095
01:02:12,329 --> 01:02:15,131
Keep this
right in your shoulder,

1096
01:02:15,132 --> 01:02:16,933
then, when you're ready,

1097
01:02:16,934 --> 01:02:19,803
you're just going to gently
squeeze that trigger, okay?

1098
01:02:19,804 --> 01:02:20,904
Keep looking
through the sights.

1099
01:02:20,905 --> 01:02:23,072
Make sure you got it,
both eyes open.

1100
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:25,909
Okay, when you're ready.

1101
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:27,777
I got you.

1102
01:02:27,778 --> 01:02:28,845
There we go.

1103
01:02:30,347 --> 01:02:32,348
It was close. Good shot.

1104
01:02:32,349 --> 01:02:33,917
Keep your weight
a little forward.

1105
01:02:33,918 --> 01:02:35,184
-  Come on, Clinton.
- Don't lean back on it.

1106
01:02:35,185 --> 01:02:36,285
Keep shootin', buddy.

1107
01:02:37,855 --> 01:02:39,122
Close.

1108
01:02:39,123 --> 01:02:40,557
Keep looking through
those sights, that's it.

1109
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:43,192
Yeah!

1110
01:02:43,193 --> 01:02:44,660
Oh, that was it!

1111
01:02:44,661 --> 01:02:46,295
Yeah! Good job.

1112
01:02:46,296 --> 01:02:47,196
Yeah!

1113
01:02:47,197 --> 01:02:48,264
Proud of you.

1114
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:49,999
Yeah! That was awesome.

1115
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,034
That was awesome.

1116
01:02:51,035 --> 01:02:52,335
Feel good? Was it fun?

1117
01:02:52,336 --> 01:02:54,637
- Nailed it, young man.
- Yeah?

1118
01:02:54,638 --> 01:02:56,105
Good shot, bud...

1119
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:57,207
Good shot, good shot.

1120
01:03:06,884 --> 01:03:08,818
Carney...

1121
01:03:11,321 --> 01:03:12,321
Carney.

1122
01:03:12,322 --> 01:03:14,290
Yeah? All right, come on.

1123
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:16,392
Everyone, listen up!

1124
01:03:17,962 --> 01:03:20,964
We've got a theory
on who this might be.

1125
01:03:20,965 --> 01:03:24,533
Agent Husk
is going to lay it out for you.

1126
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:27,670
The men who killed Alan Berg

1127
01:03:27,671 --> 01:03:31,640
have splintered off
from the Aryan Nation

1128
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:33,542
and formed a new group.

1129
01:03:33,543 --> 01:03:34,878
They are responsible

1130
01:03:34,879 --> 01:03:37,546
for a series of robberies
and murders,

1131
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:39,916
and they are inspired

1132
01:03:39,917 --> 01:03:44,553
by the doctrine in this book.

1133
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:46,923
They're using this book
as a map.

1134
01:03:46,924 --> 01:03:49,325
Jamie.

1135
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:50,426
It tells a story,

1136
01:03:50,427 --> 01:03:51,660
a fictional story,

1137
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:53,562
of a group of white separatists

1138
01:03:53,563 --> 01:03:54,998
raging a race war

1139
01:03:54,999 --> 01:03:58,734
against
the United States Government.

1140
01:03:58,735 --> 01:04:00,436
There are six steps
in this book.

1141
01:04:00,437 --> 01:04:03,339
Recruiting, fundraising, training.

1142
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:05,574
Assassination is step five.

1143
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:06,709
What's six?

1144
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:07,944
Armed revolution.

1145
01:04:07,945 --> 01:04:11,347
Large-scale
domestic terror attacks.

1146
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:13,216
Poisoning city water supply,

1147
01:04:13,217 --> 01:04:15,584
bombing federal buildings.
- Seizing the Capitol.

1148
01:04:15,585 --> 01:04:16,785
You're talking
like they're terrorists.

1149
01:04:16,786 --> 01:04:18,087
You got a better name?

1150
01:04:18,088 --> 01:04:19,688
There are plans
to assassinate the president.

1151
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:21,925
This terrorist group
have a name?

1152
01:04:21,926 --> 01:04:24,661
In the book,
they're called "The Order."

1153
01:04:27,831 --> 01:04:28,865
Yeah?

1154
01:04:33,003 --> 01:04:34,904
I've seen that book before.

1155
01:04:34,905 --> 01:04:36,805
Smith & Wesson Model 59.

1156
01:04:36,806 --> 01:04:38,707
It's clear.

1157
01:04:41,578 --> 01:04:45,714
Works in both double
and single action.

1158
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:48,318
It's heavy, isn't it?

1159
01:04:50,054 --> 01:04:50,987
I'll take it.

1160
01:04:50,988 --> 01:04:52,788
Awesome.

1161
01:04:52,789 --> 01:04:55,591
Anything else for you today?

1162
01:04:55,592 --> 01:04:57,426
Yeah, uh,
I'll take all of them.

1163
01:04:57,427 --> 01:04:59,295
Just need some I.D.

1164
01:04:59,296 --> 01:05:01,064
Sign right there, sir.

1165
01:05:01,065 --> 01:05:02,699
Touchdown, Huskies!

1166
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:24,453
You had the guy
two years ago,

1167
01:05:24,454 --> 01:05:26,089
and you fucking let him go!

1168
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:28,024
I pulled over
some of those Nations guys,

1169
01:05:28,025 --> 01:05:30,159
and they were...
- Pull the file!

1170
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,461
They had a trunk full
of that white supremacist shit

1171
01:05:32,462 --> 01:05:34,597
that I was trying to control.

1172
01:05:34,598 --> 01:05:35,631
-  Fucking idiot.
-  A fucking trunkful!

1173
01:05:35,632 --> 01:05:36,599
One of them
brought up that book,

1174
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:37,633
"The Turner Diaries,"

1175
01:05:37,634 --> 01:05:38,867
and he said,

1176
01:05:38,868 --> 01:05:39,668
"There's no escaping
The Day of the Rope."

1177
01:05:39,669 --> 01:05:41,504
You know what that means?

1178
01:05:41,505 --> 01:05:43,839
It's the day the race traitors
are strung up in the streets.

1179
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:45,308
- You know him?
-  "The Day of the Rope."

1180
01:05:45,309 --> 01:05:46,675
Lane, yeah,
he's from around here.

1181
01:05:46,676 --> 01:05:47,676
He's a fanatic.

1182
01:05:47,677 --> 01:05:48,811
Where is he?

1183
01:05:48,812 --> 01:05:50,013
I think
he's at his parents' house

1184
01:05:50,014 --> 01:05:51,148
or something like that...
- Write it down.

1185
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:53,883
- and his dad's a...
- Write it the fuck down!

1186
01:06:07,764 --> 01:06:10,167
We don't know where he is.

1187
01:06:12,902 --> 01:06:16,705
Last we heard,
David was in Washington,

1188
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:18,874
in a place called
Metaline Falls.

1189
01:06:18,875 --> 01:06:20,576
There was a man there
who had some land,

1190
01:06:20,577 --> 01:06:21,910
who had given David some work.

1191
01:06:21,911 --> 01:06:24,414
This man, does he have a name?

1192
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:28,217
We don't know.

1193
01:06:28,218 --> 01:06:30,019
Birdie,

1194
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:32,588
do we still have
that photograph?

1195
01:06:32,589 --> 01:06:35,024
Somewhere.

1196
01:06:35,025 --> 01:06:36,693
Hold on.

1197
01:06:45,235 --> 01:06:47,804
You have children, Detective?

1198
01:06:48,905 --> 01:06:51,440
Uh, yeah, two daughters.

1199
01:06:51,441 --> 01:06:53,976
Do you love 'em?

1200
01:06:53,977 --> 01:06:55,944
Do you...

1201
01:06:55,945 --> 01:06:58,348
do you care for them?

1202
01:07:00,617 --> 01:07:02,219
Have you been there for them?

1203
01:07:04,621 --> 01:07:06,389
You...

1204
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:08,191
think you have control

1205
01:07:08,192 --> 01:07:10,759
over who they're going to be,

1206
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,829
but the truth is, you don't.

1207
01:07:14,464 --> 01:07:16,599
You try to protect them.

1208
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,801
That's the best you can do,

1209
01:07:18,802 --> 01:07:21,905
but you can't
live their life for them.

1210
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:27,143
It was something peculiar,

1211
01:07:27,144 --> 01:07:30,313
like it was two first names,

1212
01:07:30,314 --> 01:07:31,114
Bill Stevens,

1213
01:07:31,115 --> 01:07:32,781
or Mathew...

1214
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:34,218
That's it.

1215
01:07:35,552 --> 01:07:38,422
The man's name is Bob Mathews.

1216
01:07:44,027 --> 01:07:47,431
Son of a bitch.

1217
01:07:51,868 --> 01:07:53,636
They pick up
at an overnight depot

1218
01:07:53,637 --> 01:07:55,171
near San Leandro, California,

1219
01:07:55,172 --> 01:07:56,472
then load up
for a two-day trip

1220
01:07:56,473 --> 01:07:58,006
from San Francisco

1221
01:07:58,007 --> 01:07:59,808
up the 101 to Eureka

1222
01:07:59,809 --> 01:08:02,945
on the coast.

1223
01:08:02,946 --> 01:08:04,347
It's the money run
for the entire northwest.

1224
01:08:04,348 --> 01:08:05,414
What's the take?

1225
01:08:05,415 --> 01:08:07,616
A usual run, uh,

1226
01:08:07,617 --> 01:08:09,485
that would be two,

1227
01:08:09,486 --> 01:08:11,820
two and a half million.

1228
01:08:11,821 --> 01:08:13,056
This could be four.

1229
01:08:23,867 --> 01:08:25,768
Hi...

1230
01:08:25,769 --> 01:08:26,903
Hi.

1231
01:08:27,904 --> 01:08:29,105
I'm Debbie.

1232
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:32,442
Oh, okay.

1233
01:08:38,582 --> 01:08:41,217
Good for you.

1234
01:08:41,218 --> 01:08:42,986
Thanks.

1235
01:08:54,531 --> 01:08:56,064
My job is to hit the windshield
if they don't get out--

1236
01:08:56,065 --> 01:08:57,700
Go back, go back, go back.

1237
01:08:57,701 --> 01:08:59,067
Start, which car are you in,

1238
01:08:59,068 --> 01:09:00,203
where are you sitting?

1239
01:09:00,204 --> 01:09:02,171
Excuse me, Bob, can we talk?

1240
01:09:02,172 --> 01:09:03,239
Uh, now?

1241
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:04,274
Yeah.

1242
01:09:05,309 --> 01:09:06,509
Okay.

1243
01:09:06,510 --> 01:09:08,411
Just keep running it.
Load up, okay?

1244
01:09:08,412 --> 01:09:10,314
- Yeah.
- All right.

1245
01:09:11,748 --> 01:09:13,482
What are you meeting about?

1246
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:14,883
Hmm?

1247
01:09:14,884 --> 01:09:16,585
Look, you know...

1248
01:09:16,586 --> 01:09:18,587
You know I can't-I can't say.

1249
01:09:20,257 --> 01:09:21,591
What about her, does she know?

1250
01:09:25,962 --> 01:09:27,997
Because people talk.

1251
01:09:31,134 --> 01:09:33,270
Is she having your baby?

1252
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:40,543
You have nothing
to worry about.

1253
01:09:40,544 --> 01:09:41,244
You know that, right?

1254
01:09:41,245 --> 01:09:42,878
I love you.

1255
01:09:42,879 --> 01:09:44,880
All I care about
is you and Clinton,

1256
01:09:44,881 --> 01:09:46,983
okay?

1257
01:09:48,117 --> 01:09:50,320
Okay? Hey. Okay?

1258
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:55,625
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1259
01:09:59,429 --> 01:10:00,095
I love you.

1260
01:10:00,096 --> 01:10:01,264
Come here. It's all right.

1261
01:10:01,265 --> 01:10:02,966
Come here.

1262
01:10:11,908 --> 01:10:13,976
Father was
an appliance store salesman.

1263
01:10:13,977 --> 01:10:15,744
Loses his job,
they grow up in a trailer,

1264
01:10:15,745 --> 01:10:17,045
blame it on all immigrants.

1265
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:19,114
Subscribes to John Birch.

1266
01:10:19,115 --> 01:10:21,116
Got arrested in '73
for lying on his W-4.

1267
01:10:21,117 --> 01:10:23,151
That's straight out of
the anti-tax playbook.

1268
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:24,987
Joins the National Alliance,

1269
01:10:24,988 --> 01:10:26,655
whose founder...
- William Luther Pierce.

1270
01:10:26,656 --> 01:10:27,656
...writes "The Turner Diaries,"

1271
01:10:27,657 --> 01:10:28,957
then he leaves that group too.

1272
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:30,293
It's a pattern.
He's a radical.

1273
01:10:30,294 --> 01:10:32,928
He's a radical, but he can't
deal with authority.

1274
01:10:32,929 --> 01:10:35,664
Look at his father,
look at Butler.

1275
01:10:35,665 --> 01:10:38,434
Clever fucker.

1276
01:10:38,435 --> 01:10:40,336
I met him.

1277
01:10:40,337 --> 01:10:41,437
You did?

1278
01:10:41,438 --> 01:10:43,072
When?

1279
01:10:44,207 --> 01:10:46,742
A few weeks back.

1280
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:48,110
He was casing me.

1281
01:10:48,111 --> 01:10:49,912
We found him.

1282
01:10:49,913 --> 01:10:51,614
Metaline Falls,
Bragg Creek Road.

1283
01:10:51,615 --> 01:10:53,749
All right, we got the address,
let's go.

1284
01:11:14,671 --> 01:11:15,971
Go, go, go! Move!

1285
01:11:15,972 --> 01:11:17,373
- Over here!
- Go around the back.

1286
01:11:17,374 --> 01:11:18,374
Move!

1287
01:11:18,375 --> 01:11:22,646
Clear! Clear! Clear! Clear!

1288
01:11:46,102 --> 01:11:49,138
Breaker, breaker,
passing me now.

1289
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:37,787
Let's get 'em.

1290
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:04,813
- Where is he?
- I don't--

1291
01:13:04,814 --> 01:13:05,914
You don't know?

1292
01:13:05,915 --> 01:13:07,315
- I don't know.
- Oh, really?

1293
01:13:07,316 --> 01:13:08,717
Goddamn, what are you doing?
We can't take her in.

1294
01:13:08,718 --> 01:13:09,885
Do you know what he did
in Denver?

1295
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:10,919
I got nothing to say!

1296
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:13,221
- Jo, Jo...
- Clinton!

1297
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:14,957
We can't take her in.
Jo, Hey, hey!

1298
01:13:14,958 --> 01:13:16,925
Get off of me!
Where are you taking my child!

1299
01:13:16,926 --> 01:13:18,627
- Jo, hey!
- You sit the fuck down!

1300
01:13:18,628 --> 01:13:20,062
We need her here.
We keep eyes on her.

1301
01:13:20,063 --> 01:13:21,430
I'd be careful
who I'm protecting,

1302
01:13:21,431 --> 01:13:23,332
you dumb Nazi bitch.
- Clinton?

1303
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:29,205
All right, take it now.

1304
01:13:59,402 --> 01:14:00,302
Go, go, go, go, go.

1305
01:14:23,059 --> 01:14:23,992
Move! Let's go!

1306
01:14:23,993 --> 01:14:25,461
Come on, let's go!

1307
01:14:30,867 --> 01:14:32,901
Get out or you're dead!

1308
01:14:32,902 --> 01:14:34,002
On the floor!

1309
01:14:34,003 --> 01:14:35,303
Move, move, move!

1310
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:37,673
Is anyone in the back? Come on!

1311
01:14:37,674 --> 01:14:38,841
Open the door!

1312
01:14:38,842 --> 01:14:39,908
Throw out your gun,

1313
01:14:39,909 --> 01:14:43,178
and come out with your hands up!

1314
01:14:43,179 --> 01:14:44,346
Get out now!

1315
01:14:45,381 --> 01:14:47,015
Go!

1316
01:14:47,016 --> 01:14:48,584
- Down, down!
- Don't shoot!

1317
01:14:48,585 --> 01:14:49,518
Move, move!

1318
01:14:53,222 --> 01:14:55,191
Take it! Let's go, let's go!

1319
01:14:59,062 --> 01:15:00,028
Don't fucking move!

1320
01:15:00,029 --> 01:15:01,196
Go!

1321
01:15:02,165 --> 01:15:03,498
Here! Go!

1322
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:04,900
Faster!

1323
01:15:04,901 --> 01:15:05,935
Go, go, go!

1324
01:15:12,308 --> 01:15:13,677
That's four minutes gone!
Let's go!

1325
01:15:22,919 --> 01:15:23,853
Take him out!

1326
01:15:30,426 --> 01:15:31,794
That's the four minutes, guys,
let's go!

1327
01:15:31,795 --> 01:15:33,896
- Let's go!
- Cops!

1328
01:15:33,897 --> 01:15:34,963
Let's get out of here!

1329
01:15:34,964 --> 01:15:36,064
Fucking pigs!

1330
01:15:36,065 --> 01:15:37,265
- Pack it up!
- Go, go!

1331
01:15:40,637 --> 01:15:42,070
Go, go, go!

1332
01:15:54,951 --> 01:15:57,285
Whoo-hoo!

1333
01:16:02,491 --> 01:16:03,927
We're good, boys.

1334
01:16:12,168 --> 01:16:14,637
How much they get?

1335
01:16:14,638 --> 01:16:16,104
3.6 million.

1336
01:16:16,105 --> 01:16:17,439
What does that buy?

1337
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:20,409
It buys an army.

1338
01:16:28,484 --> 01:16:29,918
Where... where are we at
with the gun?

1339
01:16:29,919 --> 01:16:30,986
The trace on the gun?

1340
01:16:30,987 --> 01:16:32,020
We're still waiting.

1341
01:16:32,021 --> 01:16:33,155
Waiting on what?

1342
01:16:33,156 --> 01:16:35,523
They couldn't pull any prints,

1343
01:16:35,524 --> 01:16:37,325
but ATF traced the serial number
to a store in Missoula.

1344
01:16:37,326 --> 01:16:38,326
We're working on a name.
- Where?

1345
01:16:38,327 --> 01:16:39,327
Missoula.

1346
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:41,529
- Missoula?
- Yeah.

1347
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:44,166
Do you know how far
Missoula is from here?

1348
01:16:44,167 --> 01:16:46,669
Two and a half hours.

1349
01:16:46,670 --> 01:16:50,538
So why the fuck
are we fucking waiting?

1350
01:16:50,539 --> 01:16:52,708
I-I made the call.

1351
01:16:52,709 --> 01:16:54,677
Why isn't anybody
driving to Missoula, huh?

1352
01:16:54,678 --> 01:16:56,144
Tell me.

1353
01:16:56,145 --> 01:16:59,214
Tell me, Mr. FBI.

1354
01:16:59,215 --> 01:17:00,549
- Hey.
-  Jesus...

1355
01:17:02,418 --> 01:17:04,487
I mean, you're the fucking FBI!

1356
01:17:06,055 --> 01:17:06,722
Got a fucking point.

1357
01:17:11,928 --> 01:17:13,061
You all right?

1358
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:19,534
That was fucking bullshit,

1359
01:17:19,535 --> 01:17:20,703
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1360
01:17:20,704 --> 01:17:21,971
Get in the car.

1361
01:17:23,139 --> 01:17:24,808
FBI...

1362
01:17:34,317 --> 01:17:35,918
You know, it used to be
every day

1363
01:17:35,919 --> 01:17:38,788
I was running home to see them.

1364
01:17:42,425 --> 01:17:45,193
And now...

1365
01:17:45,194 --> 01:17:46,594
this.

1366
01:17:46,595 --> 01:17:48,865
This is all I think about.

1367
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:55,503
I worked organized crime.

1368
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:57,773
Lucchese family,
you heard of them?

1369
01:17:57,774 --> 01:17:58,841
Mm-mm.

1370
01:17:58,842 --> 01:18:01,409
Nasty fuckers.

1371
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:04,412
In my last year,
I worked New York.

1372
01:18:04,413 --> 01:18:07,249
There were two dozen murders,

1373
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:08,350
and I needed to get inside.

1374
01:18:08,351 --> 01:18:11,619
I had no witnesses,

1375
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:13,121
so I recruit this girl,

1376
01:18:13,122 --> 01:18:16,191
this nanny of one of the bosses.

1377
01:18:16,192 --> 01:18:18,026
She was younger than you.

1378
01:18:18,027 --> 01:18:20,696
Smart.

1379
01:18:22,265 --> 01:18:24,667
Persuaded her to wear a wire.

1380
01:18:26,302 --> 01:18:27,535
But I don't know, they,

1381
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:29,672
how they found out,
but they did...

1382
01:18:32,508 --> 01:18:34,442
and we found her...

1383
01:18:34,443 --> 01:18:38,848
head in the East River.

1384
01:18:40,283 --> 01:18:42,250
Found her arms,

1385
01:18:42,251 --> 01:18:44,420
her legs.

1386
01:18:45,688 --> 01:18:49,025
Never found her body...

1387
01:18:59,135 --> 01:19:01,670
...and I never got anyone
for that.

1388
01:19:05,909 --> 01:19:08,711
Why are you telling me that?

1389
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:16,552
Got a name on the gun.

1390
01:19:21,925 --> 01:19:24,060
Zillah?

1391
01:19:27,063 --> 01:19:27,930
Where have you been?

1392
01:19:27,931 --> 01:19:29,732
We've been calling all over.

1393
01:19:38,241 --> 01:19:39,575
Oh, hi.

1394
01:19:41,277 --> 01:19:42,845
That's your dad.

1395
01:19:42,846 --> 01:19:45,047
Oh, my God.

1396
01:19:45,048 --> 01:19:46,549
This is your daughter.

1397
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:51,719
I'm really sorry
she's not a boy.

1398
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:54,189
She's b--
You're beautiful.

1399
01:19:54,190 --> 01:19:56,725
You want to hold her?

1400
01:19:59,095 --> 01:20:00,228
It's really easy.

1401
01:20:00,229 --> 01:20:02,797
She's sleeping, huh? Hi.

1402
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:04,132
Hmm?

1403
01:20:04,133 --> 01:20:05,134
She's so perfect.

1404
01:20:10,439 --> 01:20:11,974
- She's so little.
- I know.

1405
01:20:13,977 --> 01:20:15,677
You got her?

1406
01:20:15,678 --> 01:20:18,246
It's okay. Hi.

1407
01:20:18,247 --> 01:20:19,915
We gotta learn a lot.

1408
01:20:19,916 --> 01:20:21,683
Oh, my gosh...

1409
01:20:24,387 --> 01:20:26,554
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

1410
01:20:26,555 --> 01:20:28,223
It's all right,

1411
01:20:28,224 --> 01:20:30,258
it's all right...

1412
01:20:30,259 --> 01:20:32,895
Yeah.

1413
01:20:32,896 --> 01:20:36,398
Oh, my God, she's beautiful.

1414
01:20:58,621 --> 01:21:01,256
Bob give you this?

1415
01:21:01,257 --> 01:21:03,225
It's cute.

1416
01:21:03,226 --> 01:21:04,592
You all wear these?

1417
01:21:04,593 --> 01:21:06,295
Fuck you.

1418
01:21:12,568 --> 01:21:13,869
Give me those.

1419
01:21:17,173 --> 01:21:18,573
Alan Berg.

1420
01:21:19,608 --> 01:21:21,243
Get this.

1421
01:21:21,244 --> 01:21:22,477
They shot him 12 times.

1422
01:21:22,478 --> 01:21:25,047
Two in the face,

1423
01:21:25,048 --> 01:21:26,414
two in the neck,

1424
01:21:26,415 --> 01:21:28,116
six in the left arm,

1425
01:21:28,117 --> 01:21:29,751
one in the abdomen,

1426
01:21:29,752 --> 01:21:31,253
traversed his liver,
came out his stomach,

1427
01:21:31,254 --> 01:21:32,620
and one in the back.

1428
01:21:32,621 --> 01:21:34,556
That's a hard way to go.

1429
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:41,563
You didn't pull the trigger,

1430
01:21:41,564 --> 01:21:42,797
but you know
where they are, right?

1431
01:21:42,798 --> 01:21:44,732
Now you're gonna fucking
tell me where they are,

1432
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:46,268
or I'm gonna lean on you
so hard,

1433
01:21:46,269 --> 01:21:47,169
you're not gonna get
off the fucking floor...

1434
01:21:47,170 --> 01:21:49,004
- Terry...
- You understand me?

1435
01:21:49,005 --> 01:21:50,105
What?

1436
01:21:50,106 --> 01:21:51,473
Oh, fucking shit.

1437
01:21:51,474 --> 01:21:52,307
Your goddamn nose.

1438
01:22:23,372 --> 01:22:24,807
What are you doing here?

1439
01:22:26,075 --> 01:22:28,044
Hmm?

1440
01:22:29,112 --> 01:22:32,280
26 years I've done this job.

1441
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:36,651
26 years.

1442
01:22:36,652 --> 01:22:39,187
Every mobster,

1443
01:22:39,188 --> 01:22:41,489
every Klansman,

1444
01:22:41,490 --> 01:22:45,193
they got one thing in common.

1445
01:22:45,194 --> 01:22:47,896
They're all trying
to blame someone else.

1446
01:22:50,699 --> 01:22:52,134
You think Bob's loyal to you?

1447
01:22:52,135 --> 01:22:54,636
You-you think he's your friend?

1448
01:22:54,637 --> 01:22:56,338
Hmm?

1449
01:22:56,339 --> 01:22:57,905
You're a tool to him.

1450
01:22:57,906 --> 01:23:00,909
He's using you. You're a pawn.

1451
01:23:02,478 --> 01:23:03,711
How do you think
your friend's going to react

1452
01:23:03,712 --> 01:23:06,115
when he finds out
you're a Mexican?

1453
01:23:11,787 --> 01:23:14,290
Where is he?

1454
01:23:17,893 --> 01:23:21,329
There's a number you call

1455
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:23,832
if you ever got bopped.

1456
01:23:26,302 --> 01:23:27,669
Leave a message
at the switchboard,

1457
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:28,836
and they call back
with instructions

1458
01:23:28,837 --> 01:23:30,339
telling you how to get out.

1459
01:23:32,441 --> 01:23:34,809
You remember the number?

1460
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:58,867
Tony.

1461
01:24:00,836 --> 01:24:02,970
Is Bob driving?

1462
01:24:02,971 --> 01:24:04,240
Negative, not him.

1463
01:24:06,142 --> 01:24:09,377
Nobody goes in
till we have eyes on Mathews.

1464
01:24:09,378 --> 01:24:10,379
They're leaving.

1465
01:24:15,184 --> 01:24:16,484
Keep your distance,
three cars back.

1466
01:24:16,485 --> 01:24:18,154
I'm following.

1467
01:24:25,128 --> 01:24:26,794
Good to see you, buddy.

1468
01:24:26,795 --> 01:24:29,232
Anybody know you're here?

1469
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:32,167
Huh?

1470
01:24:32,168 --> 01:24:34,169
No.

1471
01:24:34,170 --> 01:24:35,603
Good.

1472
01:24:35,604 --> 01:24:37,373
That's real good.

1473
01:25:09,071 --> 01:25:10,838
Should I call it in?

1474
01:25:10,839 --> 01:25:13,108
Not till we see him.

1475
01:25:17,646 --> 01:25:19,114
Come on in.

1476
01:25:20,449 --> 01:25:23,050
Have a seat.

1477
01:25:27,723 --> 01:25:30,492
I'm really sorry
about the trouble you got into.

1478
01:25:30,493 --> 01:25:33,828
I'm going to help you
out of it, but, um...

1479
01:25:33,829 --> 01:25:36,664
well, I'm gonna
need your help first.

1480
01:25:36,665 --> 01:25:39,066
Man, they don't know I'm here.

1481
01:25:39,067 --> 01:25:40,735
Did you tell them anything?

1482
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:42,370
No, nothing.

1483
01:25:42,371 --> 01:25:43,338
I did what you said.

1484
01:25:43,339 --> 01:25:44,872
Well, it's not--

1485
01:25:44,873 --> 01:25:47,475
They ask about the gun?

1486
01:25:47,476 --> 01:25:50,478
No.

1487
01:25:50,479 --> 01:25:52,114
No gun.

1488
01:25:54,883 --> 01:25:57,353
Did they ask about Berg?

1489
01:26:08,764 --> 01:26:10,698
I want to...

1490
01:26:10,699 --> 01:26:14,068
I want to believe.

1491
01:26:14,069 --> 01:26:15,837
I do.

1492
01:26:15,838 --> 01:26:19,508
Why would I rat on you?

1493
01:26:21,076 --> 01:26:25,613
You guys are...

1494
01:26:25,614 --> 01:26:27,715
You guys are my friends, no?

1495
01:26:27,716 --> 01:26:30,418
Are we friends?

1496
01:26:30,419 --> 01:26:31,620
Are we?

1497
01:26:35,291 --> 01:26:36,258
You know?

1498
01:26:36,259 --> 01:26:37,459
Yes.

1499
01:26:37,460 --> 01:26:39,261
Because real friends,

1500
01:26:39,262 --> 01:26:42,597
they come clean
when they make mistakes.

1501
01:26:42,598 --> 01:26:45,633
If you told them something,

1502
01:26:45,634 --> 01:26:49,804
it's fine, okay?

1503
01:26:49,805 --> 01:26:53,976
But I do need to know the truth.

1504
01:26:56,545 --> 01:26:59,915
Just tell me
what you told them.

1505
01:27:04,487 --> 01:27:06,989
Come on.

1506
01:27:08,657 --> 01:27:11,426
We can trust each other.

1507
01:27:11,427 --> 01:27:13,429
Just tell me.

1508
01:27:15,698 --> 01:27:17,565
Whatever happens,

1509
01:27:17,566 --> 01:27:19,501
I'm here for you.

1510
01:27:19,502 --> 01:27:23,738
If you're honest now,
it's all going to be okay.

1511
01:27:23,739 --> 01:27:25,440
Thanks, Bob.

1512
01:27:25,441 --> 01:27:26,908
It's okay.

1513
01:27:28,744 --> 01:27:31,447
We're brothers.

1514
01:27:38,387 --> 01:27:40,655
I didn't say anything, Bob.

1515
01:27:40,656 --> 01:27:43,091
Nothing at all?

1516
01:27:47,062 --> 01:27:49,431
I'm sorry about the gun.

1517
01:27:49,432 --> 01:27:52,199
It's on me.

1518
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:54,702
Will you forgive me?

1519
01:27:55,971 --> 01:27:58,506
Yeah.

1520
01:27:58,507 --> 01:27:59,474
- Yeah?
- Sure.

1521
01:27:59,475 --> 01:28:00,476
Okay.

1522
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:09,084
It's gonna be all right.

1523
01:28:12,187 --> 01:28:13,456
That's him.

1524
01:28:14,890 --> 01:28:17,092
Husk, do we have a visual?

1525
01:28:20,529 --> 01:28:22,564
Do we have a visual on Mathews?

1526
01:28:22,565 --> 01:28:24,099
Call it in.

1527
01:28:25,267 --> 01:28:27,302
Wait, wh-what are you doing?

1528
01:28:32,174 --> 01:28:33,541
We've got eyes on Mathews
at the Capri Motel.

1529
01:28:33,542 --> 01:28:35,411
We need backup here now.

1530
01:28:52,795 --> 01:28:55,764
Don't fucking move!

1531
01:28:56,799 --> 01:28:59,434
Show me your hands!

1532
01:28:59,435 --> 01:29:02,438
Show me your fucking hands, Bob!

1533
01:29:04,740 --> 01:29:05,440
Show me your fuck--

1534
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:08,342
Holy shit!

1535
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:09,311
Okay.

1536
01:29:36,972 --> 01:29:38,640
Jamie!

1537
01:29:38,641 --> 01:29:40,274
Take the room!

1538
01:29:40,275 --> 01:29:43,310
Jamie, get back!

1539
01:29:43,311 --> 01:29:44,879
Get away from the door!

1540
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:46,280
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1541
01:29:46,281 --> 01:29:48,716
Freeze! Fucking freeze!

1542
01:29:48,717 --> 01:29:50,084
Hey!

1543
01:29:50,085 --> 01:29:51,886
Move!

1544
01:29:52,788 --> 01:29:53,921
Get the fuck down!

1545
01:29:53,922 --> 01:29:55,056
Tony, you all right?

1546
01:29:55,057 --> 01:29:56,758
Yeah, I'm good.

1547
01:29:56,759 --> 01:29:57,792
Don't move!

1548
01:29:57,793 --> 01:29:58,893
Don't you fucking move,
you piece of shit!

1549
01:29:58,894 --> 01:29:59,794
Fuck you.

1550
01:30:21,083 --> 01:30:22,184
Jamie!

1551
01:30:27,523 --> 01:30:29,524
Where is he?

1552
01:30:29,525 --> 01:30:30,758
Jamie!

1553
01:30:30,759 --> 01:30:32,194
Slow the fuck down!

1554
01:31:05,894 --> 01:31:06,794
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1555
01:31:06,795 --> 01:31:08,663
No, no, no, no.

1556
01:31:08,664 --> 01:31:09,831
No, no. All right.

1557
01:31:09,832 --> 01:31:11,999
Put your head down,
put your head down.

1558
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,402
Jamie, no, no, no, no.

1559
01:31:19,808 --> 01:31:22,009
Keep your head down.

1560
01:31:22,010 --> 01:31:23,978
Oh, shit.

1561
01:31:23,979 --> 01:31:25,580
Jamie, look at me, look at me.

1562
01:31:25,581 --> 01:31:27,014
Come on.

1563
01:31:30,886 --> 01:31:34,321
Jamie, look at me.

1564
01:31:34,322 --> 01:31:36,558
Look at me, look at me.

1565
01:31:36,559 --> 01:31:38,726
Jamie.

1566
01:31:38,727 --> 01:31:40,394
Shit...

1567
01:31:42,998 --> 01:31:44,633
Jamie.

1568
01:31:47,069 --> 01:31:48,436
Jamie.

1569
01:31:53,175 --> 01:31:54,276
Look at me.

1570
01:31:56,845 --> 01:31:58,313
Hey...

1571
01:33:44,853 --> 01:33:46,755
Willie, come in.

1572
01:33:49,224 --> 01:33:51,960
Now, please.

1573
01:33:54,863 --> 01:33:56,431
Get inside.

1574
01:34:49,017 --> 01:34:52,387
Found this
in Bob's hotel room.

1575
01:35:04,332 --> 01:35:06,300
Do you know how we met?

1576
01:35:06,301 --> 01:35:08,636
He put an ad in the paper.

1577
01:35:10,305 --> 01:35:14,441
"Looking for an intelligent,
mature woman

1578
01:35:14,442 --> 01:35:17,012
to share my life and my land."

1579
01:35:20,215 --> 01:35:21,883
About a hundred women responded,

1580
01:35:21,884 --> 01:35:24,086
but out of all of them,
he chose me.

1581
01:35:30,859 --> 01:35:32,160
Hmm.

1582
01:35:33,495 --> 01:35:35,396
But I couldn't have children.

1583
01:35:35,397 --> 01:35:37,331
Bob said he didn't care.

1584
01:35:37,332 --> 01:35:39,600
He was excited to adopt,

1585
01:35:39,601 --> 01:35:44,305
but I know it still mattered.

1586
01:35:44,306 --> 01:35:49,476
He wanted his line to continue.

1587
01:35:49,477 --> 01:35:52,279
Debbie, none of this is for you,

1588
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:53,948
or Clinton.

1589
01:35:53,949 --> 01:35:55,082
You don't know.

1590
01:35:55,083 --> 01:35:56,952
I do.

1591
01:35:58,553 --> 01:35:59,854
All the sacrifices,

1592
01:35:59,855 --> 01:36:02,489
the work...

1593
01:36:02,490 --> 01:36:06,360
the women.

1594
01:36:06,361 --> 01:36:07,494
He can justify it all

1595
01:36:07,495 --> 01:36:09,496
with the cause
he's fighting for.

1596
01:36:09,497 --> 01:36:14,501
End of the day,
it's all about him.

1597
01:36:14,502 --> 01:36:18,039
Believe me.

1598
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:20,875
You know that.

1599
01:36:20,876 --> 01:36:22,443
Right now,

1600
01:36:22,444 --> 01:36:24,478
he's planning an attack

1601
01:36:24,479 --> 01:36:26,781
that will kill
hundreds of people.

1602
01:36:29,017 --> 01:36:32,486
I need your help to find him.

1603
01:36:32,487 --> 01:36:34,621
Debbie, do not
protect this man

1604
01:36:34,622 --> 01:36:37,058
just because you think
he's some saint.

1605
01:36:37,059 --> 01:36:39,227
I know he's not a saint.

1606
01:36:54,576 --> 01:36:55,910
I never been there before,

1607
01:36:55,911 --> 01:36:59,046
but there was always a plan

1608
01:36:59,047 --> 01:37:02,917
if they had to run.

1609
01:37:02,918 --> 01:37:04,953
There's a house.

1610
01:37:08,290 --> 01:37:09,757
Thank you.

1611
01:37:10,993 --> 01:37:12,059
He won't know it was you.

1612
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:15,496
Doesn't matter.

1613
01:37:15,497 --> 01:37:18,699
You won't take him alive.

1614
01:37:40,522 --> 01:37:43,024
So, was it worth it?

1615
01:37:43,025 --> 01:37:44,292
What?

1616
01:37:47,262 --> 01:37:49,931
The work,

1617
01:37:49,932 --> 01:37:51,398
women,

1618
01:37:51,399 --> 01:37:53,568
sacrifices?

1619
01:37:56,804 --> 01:37:58,640
What do you think?

1620
01:38:08,516 --> 01:38:11,819
But we've always worked
very well together.

1621
01:38:31,706 --> 01:38:32,707
Where's Bob?

1622
01:38:34,842 --> 01:38:36,477
Finish your fucking cereal.

1623
01:38:36,478 --> 01:38:38,245
We've gotta get out of here.

1624
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:50,291
Hey, Bob.

1625
01:38:54,596 --> 01:38:57,365
Hey, Bob, you ready to go?

1626
01:38:58,900 --> 01:39:00,968
Hey.

1627
01:39:00,969 --> 01:39:02,737
Hey, Bob,
I got the truck outside.

1628
01:39:09,611 --> 01:39:11,779
What is this?

1629
01:39:13,248 --> 01:39:14,716
Declaration of war.

1630
01:39:20,088 --> 01:39:21,989
Who am I sending it to?

1631
01:39:21,990 --> 01:39:23,390
Congress,
the House of Representatives,

1632
01:39:23,391 --> 01:39:25,192
the White House,

1633
01:39:25,193 --> 01:39:28,396
"New York Times,"
Denver, Denver news.

1634
01:39:31,133 --> 01:39:32,299
Everyone.

1635
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:33,400
Why?

1636
01:39:33,401 --> 01:39:34,401
It's happening.

1637
01:39:34,402 --> 01:39:35,569
The war has begun.

1638
01:39:35,570 --> 01:39:36,503
Fuck. There's no fucking army.

1639
01:39:36,504 --> 01:39:38,705
Everybody's gone.

1640
01:39:38,706 --> 01:39:40,507
Cattle die,

1641
01:39:40,508 --> 01:39:41,575
kinsmen die,

1642
01:39:41,576 --> 01:39:42,876
I too shall die,

1643
01:39:42,877 --> 01:39:47,748
but the one thing that I know
that never dies,

1644
01:39:47,749 --> 01:39:49,917
it's the fame
of a dead man's deeds.

1645
01:40:50,278 --> 01:40:52,480
Bob, let's go.
We gotta go now!

1646
01:40:54,616 --> 01:40:55,616
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1647
01:40:55,617 --> 01:40:56,918
They're fucking everywhere.

1648
01:41:37,759 --> 01:41:39,861
Is he in there alone?

1649
01:41:42,864 --> 01:41:43,898
Fuck you.

1650
01:42:22,204 --> 01:42:23,971
Send 'em in.

1651
01:42:24,872 --> 01:42:27,309
Bring him out alive.

1652
01:42:30,111 --> 01:42:32,479
Alive.

1653
01:42:41,756 --> 01:42:43,190
Let's go, let's go.

1654
01:43:21,929 --> 01:43:22,796
Go, go, go!

1655
01:43:22,797 --> 01:43:24,030
Pull 'em out!

1656
01:43:29,804 --> 01:43:31,071
- Go, go!
- They're coming out!

1657
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:32,006
We've got wounded!

1658
01:43:37,211 --> 01:43:38,745
Come back!
Move it, move it!

1659
01:43:38,746 --> 01:43:40,381
Take cover!

1660
01:43:58,032 --> 01:43:59,933
It was a mistake.

1661
01:43:59,934 --> 01:44:01,568
It's a mistake.
He's not coming out.

1662
01:44:01,569 --> 01:44:03,169
- Come on, let's go.
- He's not coming out.

1663
01:44:03,170 --> 01:44:05,172
You'll burn him alive.

1664
01:44:59,361 --> 01:45:01,162
Shit.

1665
01:46:13,768 --> 01:46:15,902
Let's go.

1666
01:46:15,903 --> 01:46:18,372
It's done. Come on.

1667
01:46:23,645 --> 01:46:24,645
Bob!

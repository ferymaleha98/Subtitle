3
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:24,306
Sweet girl, you're not gonna let us down.

4
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,991
You were never here for us before.

5
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,076
I'm so glad

6
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,370
you could start now.

7
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:18,040
And you can all see...

8
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:20,459
The reason is right in front of us.

9
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:04,169
Your I-Ching horoscope.

10
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:13,136
Your wedding is February 14th?

11
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:17,849
You should have been married in April.

12
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:25,565
Your ovaries are very healthy.

13
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,317
Very powerful flow.

14
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,027
You'll be pregnant on your first try.

15
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:32,864
Stable.

16
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:34,199
Obedient.

17
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:36,910
A lap dog of a man!

18
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,614
I'm what?

19
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,783
I have a bat mitzvah I must attend.

20
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,827
Please hold up.

21
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,333
You're right.

22
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,127
Success has to be recognised.

23
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:34,676
I-Ching horoscope.

24
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:45,312
You said your business was successful?

25
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,651
Your palm.

26
00:10:56,365 --> 00:11:01,036
Your love line and career line
are tangled.

27
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:06,500
Finding your soul mate
will help your business.

28
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,888
And this person will be
one of the next five dates you go on.

29
00:53:16,861 --> 00:53:19,697
Shame on you both.

30
00:53:53,314 --> 00:53:55,232
You've gone too far.

31
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:19,882
Wishing you prosperity!

32
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:50,564
You know...

33
01:00:50,564 --> 01:00:52,733
Life is like a dance.

34
01:00:53,192 --> 01:00:54,985
Find your balance.

35
01:00:55,319 --> 01:00:57,029
Follow the rhythm.

36
01:00:57,738 --> 01:01:00,324
Dance however you want.

37
01:11:34,541 --> 01:11:36,001
I'm sorry.

38
01:11:40,255 --> 01:11:41,464
No, I'm sorry.

39
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:19,789
Not him, huh?

40
01:14:25,837 --> 01:14:26,754
No.

41
01:14:26,838 --> 01:14:29,174
But they're going to be
very happy together.

42
01:14:29,716 --> 01:14:31,926
So, who did you choose?

43
01:14:40,226 --> 01:14:43,897
My child, I didn't say whose wedding.

44
01:14:45,356 --> 01:14:47,609
I believe you have one date left.

45
01:14:52,614 --> 01:14:55,325
Your sister has amazing taste
in hors d'oeuvres.

46
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:41,449
I can't say.

47
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:45,078
I wish you guys

48
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:47,163
one hundred years of happiness.

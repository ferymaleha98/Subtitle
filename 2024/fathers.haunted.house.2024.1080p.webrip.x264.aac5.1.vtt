BAYANGSARI VILLAGE

00:20.583 --> 00:24.083
A HORROR COMEDY BY
BOBBY PRASETYO

01:01.958 --> 01:03.250
[door creaks]

01:10.500 --> 01:12.583
[house gecko chirping]

01:12.666 --> 01:13.625
[thuds]

01:16.500 --> 01:18.416
There are still a lot of house geckos.

01:19.708 --> 01:21.250
Thank God they're not tokay geckos.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
They're still a kind of gecko,

01:25.791 --> 01:27.166
but they're more premium.

01:30.750 --> 01:32.083
This is a horror movie.

01:32.583 --> 01:33.708
Please respect me.

01:34.083 --> 01:36.625
[tense music]

01:53.458 --> 01:55.625
[adult Dodit] <i>This is a story</i>
<i>about my childhood,</i>

01:56.375 --> 01:57.833
<i>but that's not me.</i>

02:01.500 --> 02:02.625
<i>Not that one either.</i>

02:04.208 --> 02:05.666
<i>There, that's me.</i>

02:10.291 --> 02:11.333
[Lis] Dodit!

02:11.750 --> 02:13.625
Did they ditch you? [giggles]

02:14.875 --> 02:16.458
- [Dewo] Boys, he is in a ditch!
- [Lis] Dodit!

02:19.666 --> 02:21.000
[kid] Huh? Dodit?

02:21.083 --> 02:22.833
[somber music]

02:22.916 --> 02:24.541
Come here! Play with me.

02:28.208 --> 02:29.041
No.

02:29.958 --> 02:31.666
My Tamiyo is out of battery.

02:32.541 --> 02:34.291
I'll lend you my battery.

02:35.416 --> 02:36.250
No.

02:36.708 --> 02:38.125
I'm going to play with my little brother.

02:40.500 --> 02:42.250
Does he have a little brother?

02:42.750 --> 02:43.625
Maybe he just got one.

02:45.416 --> 02:48.625
[Dewo] So, what kind of job is it, Dad?

02:49.041 --> 02:53.458
[Lis] What kind of work
will Dewo do in the woods?

02:54.291 --> 02:56.541
A year is too long.

02:56.625 --> 02:57.708
[Dodit's mom] Lis.

02:57.791 --> 03:02.708
Getting a promotion
and a raise isn't easy.

03:05.416 --> 03:06.791
And you too, Dewo.

03:08.333 --> 03:09.791
[in Javanese] As a husband,

03:10.166 --> 03:12.500
you are responsible for your wife.

03:13.375 --> 03:15.416
You have to be a provider.

03:15.500 --> 03:18.791
Don't be picky about jobs
or worry about the salary.

03:19.875 --> 03:21.125
- Understand?
- Yes.

03:21.208 --> 03:22.666
[awkward music]

03:22.750 --> 03:24.583
As for you, Lis.

03:25.458 --> 03:27.791
Your duties as a wife include

03:27.875 --> 03:30.875
taking care of your husband
and following his lead.

03:30.958 --> 03:33.291
[in Javanese]
Especially since you're pregnant.

03:36.875 --> 03:38.666
[playful music]

03:45.500 --> 03:46.333
Dodit.

03:48.708 --> 03:49.541
Come here, son.

03:53.333 --> 03:54.458
I have to tell you something.

03:55.291 --> 03:58.458
I'm getting a one-year assignment
for a promotion,

03:59.750 --> 04:01.916
and we'll be moving to Mantren next month.

04:04.625 --> 04:06.208
Dodit, you're moving schools.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.833
Lis, Dewo, and Mom are all coming.

04:10.416 --> 04:11.500
[in Javanese] Don't wanna.

04:11.583 --> 04:14.583
This is me telling you, not a negotiation.

04:17.875 --> 04:18.875
[Dodit's mom] Huh?

04:19.916 --> 04:20.791
Dodit!

04:20.875 --> 04:22.416
Have dinner with us!

04:25.916 --> 04:26.875
Go easy on him.

04:28.250 --> 04:29.375
He just needs to know.

04:29.958 --> 04:31.875
[somber music]

04:47.458 --> 04:48.416
Dodit.

04:59.416 --> 05:00.583
[somber music stops]

05:00.666 --> 05:02.208
You're against the wall.

05:03.291 --> 05:04.125
You'll get sore.

05:05.166 --> 05:06.416
Whatever.

05:09.375 --> 05:11.500
[in Javanese] Come here. Sit next to me.

05:14.166 --> 05:15.416
[sighs]

05:16.958 --> 05:19.416
Is this still about the Tamiyo?

05:20.250 --> 05:22.875
[somber music]

05:26.000 --> 05:27.041
Come here.

05:29.041 --> 05:29.875
[hums]

05:33.458 --> 05:37.208
If it's still about the Tamiyo car,

05:38.416 --> 05:40.500
we should go with Dad.

05:41.333 --> 05:44.500
When he gets a raise,

05:44.583 --> 05:49.458
I promise to get you a Tamiyo car
like the ones your friends have.

05:49.541 --> 05:51.250
When will that be?

05:52.166 --> 05:53.958
Well, in a year or so.

05:55.500 --> 05:56.833
That's too long.

05:58.541 --> 06:01.583
Be patient.

06:01.666 --> 06:05.875
It's better late than never, right?

06:07.250 --> 06:09.416
You promise you'll get me a Tamiyo car?

06:10.625 --> 06:11.458
I promise.

06:12.291 --> 06:13.958
A year will go by quickly.

06:14.708 --> 06:15.666
An expensive one?

06:16.083 --> 06:19.250
The most expensive.

06:20.250 --> 06:21.083
I want five.

06:24.083 --> 06:24.958
Sure.

06:27.375 --> 06:28.958
In five years.

06:29.375 --> 06:30.708
One each year.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.208
Come on, Mom.

06:33.291 --> 06:34.291
[chuckles]

06:34.833 --> 06:36.416
Come on, Dodit.

06:38.208 --> 06:39.041
[chuckles]

06:39.125 --> 06:41.375
[in Javanese] There you go, smile.

06:41.458 --> 06:43.375
Yup. Pull it for me.

06:44.416 --> 06:45.750
- Tightly.
- Yeah, tightly.

06:46.458 --> 06:48.333
Great job. [chuckles]

06:48.958 --> 06:50.000
Is this one ready?

06:50.458 --> 06:51.291
Yeah.

06:52.833 --> 06:54.416
- Is that everything, dear?
- Yes.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.833
Dewo, I'll see you there.

06:58.291 --> 06:59.250
Yes, Dad.

07:06.500 --> 07:09.208
[motorcycle revving]

07:09.291 --> 07:10.333
[Dodit's mom] Take care!

07:12.708 --> 07:13.791
[chuckles]

07:15.250 --> 07:17.416
Would you do this in front of Dad?

07:17.500 --> 07:19.416
[playful music]

07:19.500 --> 07:20.541
[chuckles]

07:20.625 --> 07:21.625
[clears throat]

07:23.708 --> 07:24.625
Ma'am. Sir.

07:25.250 --> 07:27.083
I can't drive with my eyes shut.

07:28.708 --> 07:30.250
I feel awkward looking at you two.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.583
[giggling]

07:41.041 --> 07:41.875
Let's go.

07:44.833 --> 07:46.041
Damn it.

07:46.125 --> 07:47.958
TODAY: THURSDAY 16
TOMORROW: KLIWON FRIDAY

07:53.875 --> 07:57.416
[ominous music]

08:07.250 --> 08:12.375
WELCOME TO PRENDUS SUB-DISTRICT

08:34.250 --> 08:36.083
[exclaims] Gosh.

08:37.541 --> 08:38.541
It broke down again?

08:39.166 --> 08:40.375
Looks like it.

08:42.708 --> 08:43.541
I'll give it a push.

08:46.541 --> 08:47.541
[grunts]

08:47.625 --> 08:51.250
[man singing in Javanese]

08:54.833 --> 08:56.333
What is that on the tree, dear?

08:57.666 --> 08:58.666
Nothing.

08:59.416 --> 09:00.666
[Dodit's mom] Look!

09:00.750 --> 09:02.541
- It's a monkey.
- There's no way it's a monkey!

09:02.625 --> 09:03.500
Watch your mouth!

09:04.208 --> 09:07.291
- [tense music]
- [man's singing continues]

09:20.000 --> 09:21.708
[motorcycle engine stopping]

09:22.708 --> 09:23.583
Did you get everything, Dewo?

09:23.666 --> 09:25.041
[chuckles] Almost.

09:26.458 --> 09:27.375
Come on.

09:31.583 --> 09:34.000
[tense music]

09:41.958 --> 09:43.791
Spooky.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.250
There's a prison cell.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.958
Sheesh. It's just a cell.

09:53.666 --> 09:54.791
- Boo!
- [shrieks]

09:54.875 --> 09:56.000
[laughs]

09:56.916 --> 09:58.041
[mocking] Scared?

09:59.875 --> 10:00.750
Lis.

10:03.666 --> 10:05.958
You're just the same.

10:06.916 --> 10:08.750
Aren't you two tired?

10:08.833 --> 10:11.333
[ominous music]

10:16.583 --> 10:17.666
It's so quiet.

10:18.541 --> 10:20.625
I haven't seen anyone around here.

10:21.541 --> 10:24.666
It's nine in the evening.
People are inside their homes.

10:25.166 --> 10:26.541
It's not the city, after all.

10:31.458 --> 10:32.458
Get some rest, dear.

10:32.541 --> 10:33.500
[Joko groans]

10:33.583 --> 10:35.666
Lis, come inside.

10:36.916 --> 10:39.250
It's not good for pregnant women
to be outside at night. Come in.

10:39.333 --> 10:42.166
I'm perfectly fine outside, Mom.

10:42.250 --> 10:44.083
[motorcycle engine revving]

10:54.375 --> 10:55.916
Good evening, sir, ma'am.

10:56.250 --> 10:57.500
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

10:57.583 --> 11:01.458
My apologies, Mr. Joko.
I thought you were arriving tomorrow.

11:02.875 --> 11:04.250
I'm Sugeng.

11:05.083 --> 11:06.833
This is Kasno, he's the new kid.

11:07.666 --> 11:10.666
We'll be your staff here.

11:10.750 --> 11:12.458
Oh.

11:12.541 --> 11:16.583
Frankly, we were hesitant to come here.

11:16.666 --> 11:20.625
After all, tonight is the night before
Kliwon Friday.

11:20.708 --> 11:21.916
[ominous music]

11:23.166 --> 11:24.333
This is my wife.

11:25.583 --> 11:28.125
This is Lis, my daughter.
Her husband, Dewo.

11:29.125 --> 11:30.958
This is my youngest child, Dodit.

11:32.750 --> 11:36.500
Are you two from around here?

11:37.125 --> 11:38.625
Ah, we're from…

11:39.083 --> 11:39.791
somewhere around.

11:39.875 --> 11:42.333
- [laughing]
- [playful music]

11:46.625 --> 11:48.458
[laughing]

11:50.333 --> 11:52.416
We've prepared the house, sir.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.833
You and your family can go ahead and rest.

11:54.916 --> 11:55.708
Thank you.

11:55.791 --> 11:58.750
Okay, then. We'll be on our way.

11:58.833 --> 12:01.291
We'll be back here tomorrow
at six in the morning.

12:01.375 --> 12:02.500
You're going already?

12:02.958 --> 12:06.125
Didn't you say it was Kliwon Friday Eve?

12:07.041 --> 12:08.666
It's a bit spooky.

12:09.208 --> 12:12.375
Driver, weren't there rooms available?

12:13.000 --> 12:13.708
Over there, ma'am.

12:14.083 --> 12:15.583
- That one?
- Yes.

12:16.083 --> 12:17.791
Spend the night here.

12:17.875 --> 12:19.666
Uh, thank you, ma'am.

12:20.458 --> 12:21.875
We better go home.

12:22.333 --> 12:24.416
We don't want to trouble you.

12:24.500 --> 12:26.125
It's no trouble at all.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
Our home is close by. Right, Kasno?

12:31.333 --> 12:33.375
What? No, it's ages away.

12:34.125 --> 12:35.625
It's close.

12:35.708 --> 12:38.541
If we're talking about ages away,
it'd be Aceh,

12:39.833 --> 12:42.583
Polewali Mandar, or Rangkasbitung.

12:42.666 --> 12:44.416
[chuckles awkwardly]

12:44.500 --> 12:45.541
[Lis] Mister.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.791
What is that cell for?

12:49.125 --> 12:50.000
[Lis] Do you know?

12:50.083 --> 12:55.000
From what I know,
it was used to imprison "blandong."

12:55.083 --> 12:56.250
"Blandong"?

12:56.708 --> 12:57.750
Wood thieves.

12:59.291 --> 13:00.750
That's scary.

13:01.541 --> 13:02.791
[in Javanese] Then spend the night here.

13:03.250 --> 13:04.083
Okay?

13:04.166 --> 13:08.458
Refusing a request from your boss
is bad manners. Right, dear?

13:09.291 --> 13:10.250
[chuckles]

13:10.333 --> 13:11.916
- Yes, ma'am.
- Huh?

13:12.000 --> 13:14.541
Okay, come in. Let's check the post
while we're at it.

13:15.500 --> 13:17.958
Isn't it better to wait until tomorrow?

13:18.041 --> 13:20.041
It's Kliwon Friday tonight.

13:20.125 --> 13:23.125
Exactly. We have to make the most
of Kliwon Friday.

13:24.125 --> 13:27.416
Nobody is outside. The thieves
thought it'd be a quiet night.

13:30.041 --> 13:30.958
Fine.

13:32.041 --> 13:33.791
I'll patrol by myself.

13:35.083 --> 13:37.750
[in Javanese]
You guys can just sleep here.

13:38.708 --> 13:39.833
[Dewo] Dad.

13:39.916 --> 13:42.791
I'll join you since they feel scared.

13:42.875 --> 13:44.041
[Joko] No need.

13:44.125 --> 13:47.833
You stay here with Lis.
You'll start working tomorrow.

13:47.916 --> 13:48.833
Okay.

13:48.916 --> 13:51.250
If so, I'll go with you, sir.

13:52.041 --> 13:54.083
That goes without saying, Kasno.

13:54.416 --> 13:57.250
It is our job.

13:58.291 --> 13:59.458
We'll join you, sir.

14:00.333 --> 14:02.541
Okay. I'll get ready.

14:03.250 --> 14:04.000
Yes, sir.

14:06.333 --> 14:07.875
Come on in.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.583
- Can we help you with anything, ma'am?
- [Dodit's mom] It's fine.

14:10.666 --> 14:12.250
Oh, this.

14:12.333 --> 14:14.875
Please bring the table
and cabinets inside.

14:14.958 --> 14:16.916
Okay. Kasno will help you with that.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
[Dodit's mom] Okay. Come on, Kasno.

14:18.458 --> 14:19.666
Excuse me.

14:19.750 --> 14:21.083
You got this.

14:23.875 --> 14:26.666
[tense music]

14:28.250 --> 14:30.500
[house gecko chirping]

14:30.583 --> 14:31.500
Let me help, Kasno.

14:33.166 --> 14:34.208
[Dewo grunts]

14:37.166 --> 14:40.416
I wonder why
Dad's staff didn't want to stay here.

14:44.416 --> 14:46.125
Maybe this house is haunted.

14:56.541 --> 14:57.458
[groans]

14:58.750 --> 15:01.416
Lis, help me out a bit.

15:05.791 --> 15:06.583
Yes, sweetie?

15:07.416 --> 15:08.458
Are you tired?

15:08.541 --> 15:11.125
Mommy is tired too.

15:11.208 --> 15:12.500
[playful music]

15:12.916 --> 15:14.166
You want to lie down?

15:15.041 --> 15:16.208
Oh.

15:16.666 --> 15:19.166
Okay. I'll lie down with you.

15:22.583 --> 15:23.708
What is it, sweetie?

15:23.791 --> 15:24.791
You're tired?

15:24.875 --> 15:27.541
I see.

15:27.625 --> 15:29.083
It's okay.

15:29.166 --> 15:31.125
Daddy will carry it all myself.

15:31.208 --> 15:32.875
Just wish me luck, sweetie.

15:32.958 --> 15:33.916
"Yes, Daddy."

15:41.583 --> 15:43.083
Well done.

15:52.041 --> 15:54.000
- Dewo!
- What is it?

15:54.083 --> 15:56.958
- What is it?
- The house gecko! Get rid of it!

15:57.041 --> 15:58.166
Oh, please.

16:00.916 --> 16:02.000
- [thuds]
- [gasps] Dear!

16:05.041 --> 16:06.041
Stop.

16:06.125 --> 16:08.291
What? You want to be thrown at Lis?

16:08.791 --> 16:10.125
Oh.

16:10.208 --> 16:12.583
Throw it at me and we're divorced.

16:12.666 --> 16:14.250
[somber music]

16:15.416 --> 16:16.916
It was only a joke.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.791

- Dewo!

16:18.875 --> 16:20.791

[ominous music]

16:43.791 --> 16:46.250
I wonder what Mr. Joko
is doing at the post.

16:47.125 --> 16:49.375
Is it really okay for us to leave early?

16:51.458 --> 16:54.166
Enough. Don't worry about it.

16:55.083 --> 16:57.041
Be grateful we were able to leave early.

16:58.500 --> 17:01.083
Besides, he's an adult.

17:02.708 --> 17:05.541
He seems like someone who works hard.

17:06.666 --> 17:07.583
Exactly.

17:08.041 --> 17:09.625
He'll make things harder for us.

17:09.708 --> 17:10.666
Huh?

17:11.791 --> 17:13.333
Let's get some rest.

17:23.875 --> 17:25.666
Don't you know the history of this house?

17:25.750 --> 17:26.791
I know.

17:27.416 --> 17:28.500
During the Dutch…

17:28.583 --> 17:29.458
[yelps, shushes]

17:30.625 --> 17:32.166
Don't say it.

17:33.083 --> 17:34.916
The house is right next to us.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.083

I'll go out and check. Okay?

19:04.875 --> 19:05.875
I'm coming with you.

19:41.708 --> 19:44.916
See, I told you this house is spooky.

19:45.416 --> 19:47.125
[ominous music]

20:09.541 --> 20:10.833
Maybe it's a burglar?

20:12.208 --> 20:12.958
Go check it out.

20:17.458 --> 20:19.291
Surely you can handle a burglar.

20:20.250 --> 20:22.500
You don't want to get fired, do you?

20:34.666 --> 20:35.583
[Mom grunts]

20:36.708 --> 20:38.458
If you're this scared,

20:40.041 --> 20:41.166
I'm even more scared.

20:42.791 --> 20:44.291
I'm not scared.

20:45.333 --> 20:47.250
But as a good senior,

20:47.750 --> 20:50.583
I should let my junior step up.

20:53.958 --> 20:57.500
Do you know what "Kasno" means
in ancient Javanese?

21:01.666 --> 21:05.250
"Kas." Cou…

21:07.291 --> 21:10.208
"No." …rage.

21:11.333 --> 21:14.916
Kasno, the courageous.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.916

21:23.666 --> 21:24.458
Is that true?

Huh? What?

21:52.833 --> 21:53.791
Let's go.

Let's check it out together,

22:22.791 --> 22:24.375
but I'll take the lead.

22:27.291 --> 22:30.666
So, on the count of three,

22:32.166 --> 22:33.500
we'll go outside together.

22:35.583 --> 22:36.625
One.

22:46.416 --> 22:47.708
- Kasno!
- Ma'am?

22:48.541 --> 22:50.458
Why are you running around
and yelling like that?

22:50.791 --> 22:52.875
I thought I heard a burglar.

22:56.666 --> 23:00.750
I heard something in there.
I thought someone had broken in.

23:00.833 --> 23:01.666
Did you hear that too?

23:04.666 --> 23:05.625
Everything all right, ma'am?

23:05.708 --> 23:07.000
Sugeng! Jeez!

23:08.250 --> 23:09.458
I've checked everything.

23:09.916 --> 23:11.708
[motorcycle engine revving]

23:16.333 --> 23:17.416
All right.

23:18.125 --> 23:19.166
[Dodit's mom] Come on.

23:22.250 --> 23:23.166
What's the matter, dear?

23:23.500 --> 23:24.416
Nothing.

23:25.166 --> 23:26.083
Let's go inside.

23:29.750 --> 23:30.875
Safe?

23:31.875 --> 23:33.458
You didn't even follow me outside.

23:33.541 --> 23:37.083
I was checking inside the house.

23:37.166 --> 23:40.000
The cabinets and door frames
are all teak wood.

23:40.083 --> 23:40.916
[sharp rapping]

23:41.000 --> 23:43.208

- [playful music]

23:43.958 --> 23:44.875

- Teak?
- Yeah.

23:52.083 --> 23:53.166

23:56.083 --> 23:58.791
You're still new.
You won't be able to tell.

You'll be able to do it one day.

Right. Take care.

Yeah.

24:25.291 --> 24:28.166
Lis, come on.

24:28.250 --> 24:32.083
You're not going to see your husband off?

24:32.166 --> 24:33.708
I'm about to.

24:33.791 --> 24:35.458
He shouldn't have been so early.

24:35.541 --> 24:38.166
[old man in Javanese] Good morning.

24:38.250 --> 24:39.875
Good morning.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.250
Give this to him.

24:50.291 --> 24:51.208
Okay?

24:52.625 --> 24:53.666
Give me a moment.

24:53.750 --> 24:54.666
[Slamet] Okay.

25:02.458 --> 25:03.375
Miss.

25:04.083 --> 25:06.083
How is it, living in this house?

25:06.625 --> 25:08.291
What do you mean?

25:08.375 --> 25:10.125

So many died in this house.

25:24.875 --> 25:27.125
[tense music]

25:27.208 --> 25:30.458
There were dozens of wood thieves
during the Dutch era!

[Joko] Mbah.

25:34.291 --> 25:35.583
[in Javanese] Pardon, Mbah.

25:35.666 --> 25:37.208
Please don't talk nonsense.

25:37.750 --> 25:39.083
[in Indonesian] You'll scare my family.

25:39.791 --> 25:40.833
Right.

25:40.916 --> 25:42.291
Dear?

25:45.041 --> 25:46.708
You're back already?

25:46.791 --> 25:48.625
I forgot my singlet.

If I don't wear it,

Remember, Mom says pregnant women
shouldn't be out at dusk.

You should stay in the bedroom with me
and we can have fun.

28:29.375 --> 28:32.125
Not a chance. You stink.

28:33.916 --> 28:35.791
I don't have to smell good in the woods.

28:35.875 --> 28:37.291
In fact, I'm going back after this.

30:42.041 --> 30:43.458
- Let's do rock paper scissors, Kasno.
- Let's do it.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.291
- I won!
- Best out of three.

30:49.291 --> 30:50.041
I won!

30:50.708 --> 30:51.625
I won!

30:51.708 --> 30:53.375
[tense music]

30:56.458 --> 30:57.500
Then you go.

30:57.583 --> 30:59.208
Why me?

30:59.291 --> 31:02.291
In Javanese rock paper scissors,
the winner goes.

31:04.958 --> 31:06.083
Go.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.125
You're lucky.

31:09.541 --> 31:11.958
"Kasno" means courageous.

31:12.875 --> 31:14.125
Go, you can do it.

31:15.791 --> 31:16.708
Don't be stubborn.

31:18.291 --> 31:20.916
[ominous music]

31:35.333 --> 31:36.166
[metal clinks]

31:36.791 --> 31:38.791
[shrieks]

31:39.875 --> 31:44.375
How could you believe in my staff's
and Mbah Slamet's ghost stories?

31:44.458 --> 31:45.708
But it's true, Dad.

31:45.791 --> 31:48.333
I experienced it myself.
You too, right, Mom?

31:48.416 --> 31:49.583
Right.

31:50.208 --> 31:51.458
Just let him be.

31:52.458 --> 31:55.375
If he doesn't believe it,
there will be consequences.

31:55.833 --> 31:59.416
Consequences happen
when you disobey your parents

32:00.208 --> 32:02.375
or defy your husband.

32:02.750 --> 32:04.416
There are no consequences with ghosts.

32:06.541 --> 32:09.416
[exclaiming]

32:09.500 --> 32:13.416
[TV playing indistinctly]

32:14.041 --> 32:16.916
With the official opening
of this conservation area,

32:17.000 --> 32:20.208
we hope for a healthier ecosystem.

32:21.291 --> 32:25.875
Building infrastructure
should go hand-in-hand with…

32:25.958 --> 32:27.458
Did you pee in the open?

32:27.875 --> 32:28.791
[shushing]

32:29.166 --> 32:30.833
- [Joko] …and most importantly…
- Pay attention.

32:31.375 --> 32:33.166
…to cut down on teak wood theft.

32:34.166 --> 32:35.625
[village elder] Amen.

32:35.708 --> 32:39.708
May our forest be safer with you here.

32:40.416 --> 32:41.791
With round-the-clock monitoring…

32:41.875 --> 32:43.708
- [tense music]
- …the thieves won't have time.

32:44.041 --> 32:45.833
[laughing]

32:47.041 --> 32:47.958
Nice one.

32:48.041 --> 32:49.166
This is my wife.

32:49.250 --> 32:51.250
Hi. I'm Mrs. Joko.

32:51.583 --> 32:52.291
And my son.

32:53.041 --> 32:54.666
Shall we eat?

32:55.000 --> 32:56.666
[growling]

32:58.833 --> 33:00.125
I seek forgiveness from Allah!

33:00.583 --> 33:01.666
You're a Christian!

33:02.041 --> 33:03.166
Jesus Christ!

33:03.250 --> 33:04.833
[growling]

33:04.916 --> 33:05.625
Sugeng!

33:07.208 --> 33:09.375
[in Javanese] I demand a proper burial!

33:10.833 --> 33:11.708
Sir!

33:11.791 --> 33:13.958
- [growling]
- [Joko] Sugeng!

33:14.041 --> 33:16.916
- Sugeng!
- [all gasping and shrieking]

33:17.000 --> 33:19.500
[tense music]

33:19.583 --> 33:22.916
- [Dodit's mom] Sir! Sir!
- Sir! Call Mbah Slamet!

33:23.500 --> 33:24.416
Hold him!

33:24.500 --> 33:26.041
[Kasno exclaiming]

33:26.125 --> 33:27.666
[tense music stops]

33:27.750 --> 33:29.208
- [Dewo] Kasno!
- [exclaims]

33:29.291 --> 33:30.250
[Dewo] Kasno!

33:30.333 --> 33:32.666
[yells]

33:32.750 --> 33:36.000
- There's no Javanese rock paper scissors!
- Calm yourself, Kasno.

33:36.083 --> 33:39.375
How dare you wipe
your dirty hands on me! [yells]

33:39.458 --> 33:41.166
- Stop, Kasno!
- [groans]

33:41.250 --> 33:42.833
- That's enough.
- [playful music]

33:42.916 --> 33:44.625
[village elder] I think he's dead.

33:46.083 --> 33:48.333
[grunts]

33:48.416 --> 33:52.666
[Joko] I'm here for work.
I can't just return as I please.

33:53.500 --> 33:56.958
[Dodit's mom] You saw what happened!

33:57.291 --> 34:00.083
Do you not think about the kids' safety?

34:00.166 --> 34:01.541
They're locals.

34:01.625 --> 34:04.875
I meant our kids! Not your staff!

34:06.416 --> 34:07.750
[sighs] Oh my God.

34:08.291 --> 34:11.875
[sighs] You never think
about the kids' safety.

34:11.958 --> 34:13.166
How could you?

34:13.791 --> 34:16.375
Lis is expecting.

34:16.458 --> 34:18.083
Dodit is still a kid.

34:18.666 --> 34:20.750
We should trust God with this.

34:20.833 --> 34:21.708
What?

34:21.791 --> 34:23.625
We can't simply go back
because we're scared.

34:23.708 --> 34:25.041
I'm here on duty.

34:26.083 --> 34:27.583
I can't run away from my responsibilities.

34:27.666 --> 34:29.625
That's a responsibility to your job.

34:30.375 --> 34:33.291
What about your responsibilities
to your family?

34:33.375 --> 34:34.708
[somber music]

34:34.791 --> 34:38.416
You spend so little of the night here
if any at all.

34:38.500 --> 34:40.375
I rarely come home
because I'm on patrol duty,

34:41.750 --> 34:44.000
not spending the night with a young wife!

34:44.083 --> 34:45.166
[music turns sour]

34:46.250 --> 34:47.750
So you thought about having a young wife?

34:47.833 --> 34:48.958
How could you say that?

34:49.041 --> 34:49.958
You brought it up first!

34:50.041 --> 34:51.708
- What?
- Spending the night with a young wife!

34:51.791 --> 34:53.041
- I don't have one.
- What if you did?

34:53.125 --> 34:54.541
I'd come home.

34:56.500 --> 34:57.583
Do you have one?

34:57.666 --> 34:59.666
You don't want another wife, right, Dad?

34:59.750 --> 35:01.416
[playful music]

35:01.750 --> 35:02.875
Shush!

35:02.958 --> 35:04.000
Stay out of this.

35:06.291 --> 35:07.333
[grunts]

35:09.708 --> 35:10.833
[door slams]

35:10.916 --> 35:13.375
[somber music]

35:13.458 --> 35:15.708
[door creaks]

35:18.125 --> 35:19.041
What is it, son?

35:19.708 --> 35:21.041
Are you okay, Mom?

35:21.666 --> 35:24.625
[sighs deeply]

35:25.375 --> 35:26.291
I'm okay.

35:31.416 --> 35:32.333
What's wrong?

35:32.958 --> 35:34.750
You still remember, right?

35:35.833 --> 35:38.708
That you'll get me a Tamiyo car
when we return home.

35:42.583 --> 35:47.416
I'd be ashamed to go home
without a Tamiyo.

35:52.541 --> 35:53.458
No, you won't.

35:56.041 --> 35:56.958
I remember.

35:59.458 --> 36:06.208
I'll get you the most expensive
Tamiyo in the world.

36:07.083 --> 36:07.833
Okay?

36:14.583 --> 36:17.666
[adult Dodit's voice]
All I want is a Tamiyo car.

36:18.625 --> 36:21.833
But why does it feel so difficult?

36:24.083 --> 36:25.875
My family is truly something else.

36:27.500 --> 36:29.916
[heavy breathing]

36:33.083 --> 36:34.875
[winces]

36:35.708 --> 36:38.041
You really don't remember anything?

36:39.583 --> 36:41.750
Yeah. I can't remember a thing.

36:43.250 --> 36:45.333
When I came to, I was all beaten up.

36:47.791 --> 36:49.000
Thank goodness.

36:49.500 --> 36:50.750
[winces]

36:51.666 --> 36:52.750
Why does it hurt so bad?

36:54.041 --> 36:56.000
Is this really because I got possessed?

36:58.125 --> 37:00.125
Yeah, it's normal.

37:00.791 --> 37:02.125
My cousin was like that too.

37:02.666 --> 37:03.500
Oh.

37:04.416 --> 37:05.333
All good here.

37:07.416 --> 37:09.250
[playful music]

37:11.083 --> 37:11.875
Uncle!

37:15.875 --> 37:16.791
Who is he referring to?

37:17.208 --> 37:18.875
You, Sugeng. You're the oldest.

37:21.666 --> 37:23.375
Don't call me Uncle, Dodit.

37:24.000 --> 37:24.875
It makes me sound old.

37:25.208 --> 37:26.041
Okay, Sugeng.

37:27.541 --> 37:28.916
That's too casual.

37:29.958 --> 37:32.458
Call me Mister Sugeng. Okay?

37:33.125 --> 37:34.250
What's the matter?

37:34.333 --> 37:37.708
Mister, you know what's wrong
with this house, right?

37:37.791 --> 37:39.458
[tense music]

37:40.708 --> 37:41.625
This house?

37:46.333 --> 37:48.583
If you don't want to tell me,

37:49.083 --> 37:50.166
that's fine.

37:50.541 --> 37:52.125
Please take me to Mbah Slamet's place.

37:52.208 --> 37:53.083
Huh?

37:54.041 --> 37:56.416
Why? His house is far away.

37:57.875 --> 37:58.791
It's close.

37:59.458 --> 38:01.958
If we're talking about far, it'd be Aceh,

38:02.041 --> 38:05.291
Polewali Mandar, or Rangkasbitung.

38:05.375 --> 38:06.958
[stifled laughter]

38:13.875 --> 38:16.291
I don't mind, Mbah. Please tell me.

38:19.083 --> 38:20.500
[sighs]

38:21.166 --> 38:23.375
[distant rooster crows]

38:25.250 --> 38:26.791
To help you loosen up.

38:29.083 --> 38:32.208
[Slamet chuckles] To loosen up.

38:33.041 --> 38:33.875
[hums]

38:37.208 --> 38:38.125
Please.

38:47.208 --> 38:48.375
Ah.

38:49.166 --> 38:55.500
Back in the Dutch colonial days,

38:56.291 --> 38:59.541
a local girl

38:59.625 --> 39:06.083
was impregnated by a married Dutchman.

39:06.166 --> 39:08.791
Mimin was the name.

39:08.875 --> 39:09.833
Huh?

39:10.583 --> 39:11.791
Mimin?

39:11.875 --> 39:14.041
How could a man be named Mimin?

39:14.125 --> 39:15.625
Yeah, impossible.

39:15.708 --> 39:16.750
Are you sure it's not Maman?

39:16.833 --> 39:19.958
It was the girl's name.

39:20.625 --> 39:21.458
[in unison, softly] Oh.

39:21.541 --> 39:24.416
Her name was Rukmini.

39:24.500 --> 39:25.541
Oh.

39:26.958 --> 39:32.625
Their relationship was discovered
by the Dutchman's wife.

39:34.166 --> 39:37.458
Then, the Dutchman left Mimin.

39:38.666 --> 39:44.666
He even managed to shift the blame,

39:44.750 --> 39:51.250
accusing Mimin of lying
about their relationship.

39:52.458 --> 39:54.375
After that, Mimin was locked up

39:54.833 --> 39:59.833
in a cell at your Dad's
official residence.

40:00.791 --> 40:03.750
Mimin was not allowed to see anyone,

40:03.833 --> 40:08.875
including the man who loved her.

40:12.375 --> 40:13.875
The man who…

40:13.958 --> 40:16.166
[in unison] Loved her.

40:18.375 --> 40:24.083
She was even falsely accused of theft

40:24.666 --> 40:27.166
and had her thumb cut off.

40:28.416 --> 40:29.791
Her right or left one?

40:29.875 --> 40:30.916
Hey!

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
Why is that important?

40:33.083 --> 40:34.333
She could be a lefty.

40:34.416 --> 40:35.333
So what if she is?

40:35.416 --> 40:37.750
- That means she's right-brained…
- [shushing]

40:39.000 --> 40:40.416
You two are so childish.

40:42.250 --> 40:43.375
Please continue, Mbah.

40:43.458 --> 40:47.166
Mimin was suffering.

40:47.916 --> 40:53.041
She gave birth to her baby
inside that cell.

40:54.208 --> 40:58.291
And soon after, they both died.

41:00.083 --> 41:06.166
They died on the night of Kliwon Friday.

41:06.250 --> 41:07.291
[tense music]

41:08.541 --> 41:09.375
Which month?

41:09.458 --> 41:11.000
[music dies down]

41:11.083 --> 41:12.750
Your questions are irrelevant.

41:12.833 --> 41:15.833
It might be a Libra like me.

41:17.166 --> 41:18.208
Are you a Libra too?

41:18.291 --> 41:19.083
Yeah.

41:19.166 --> 41:21.000
I'm a Kliwon Libra.

41:21.083 --> 41:22.708
I'm a Pahing Libra. [chuckles]

41:23.416 --> 41:25.916
No wonder we get along and never clash.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.125
Nice.

41:27.208 --> 41:29.291
Have you ever felt indecisive?

41:29.375 --> 41:33.291
Of course not. Kliwon Libras
are quick decision-makers.

41:33.375 --> 41:35.250
Man, lucky you.

41:35.333 --> 41:36.291
Oh, come on.

41:36.375 --> 41:37.750
[winces]

41:39.875 --> 41:41.208
You have bad luck though.

41:41.291 --> 41:43.500
[whimpering softly]

41:44.875 --> 41:46.000
[Joko] <i>Son, please.</i>

41:46.083 --> 41:50.291
Mbah Slamet is known to talk nonsense,
yet you believe him?

41:51.916 --> 41:53.250
[sighs] Well.

41:54.500 --> 41:56.541
I'll wash up and have a nap.

41:59.875 --> 42:01.541
Here's some more pocket money.

42:08.166 --> 42:09.708
You're still here?

42:11.833 --> 42:12.958
Did Dad give you pocket money?

42:14.666 --> 42:15.583
Not yet.

42:16.166 --> 42:17.833
[bright music]

42:18.541 --> 42:19.458
Here.

42:20.666 --> 42:21.875
Keep it.

42:23.125 --> 42:24.166
Go on.

42:24.250 --> 42:25.083
[bright music stops]

42:25.166 --> 42:27.833
[owl hooting]

42:28.208 --> 42:29.125
[yawns]

42:32.458 --> 42:34.791
Are you getting sleepy this early, Kasno?

42:36.375 --> 42:37.250
[yawns]

42:37.333 --> 42:38.625
Sheesh.

42:38.708 --> 42:41.958
Feel free to sleep. I'll keep watch.

42:42.750 --> 42:43.666
Yes, sir.

42:46.875 --> 42:47.833
Don't say yes.

42:48.500 --> 42:51.125
But he offered, Sugeng.

42:51.958 --> 42:54.750
It's just courtesy.

42:54.833 --> 42:58.250
Then I'll take up the offer.
Wake me up later.

42:59.291 --> 43:01.333
Dewo. You keep watch with me.

43:02.166 --> 43:03.083
Yes, Dad.

43:04.916 --> 43:05.833
[groans]

43:18.666 --> 43:20.041
[clatters]

43:28.250 --> 43:30.625
[ominous music]

43:36.333 --> 43:38.625
[hoarse voice] Help me.

43:38.708 --> 43:39.500
[growls]

43:39.583 --> 43:44.000
- [yelps, screams]
- Sugeng?!

43:44.083 --> 43:45.166
What is it?

43:46.125 --> 43:47.125
He's possessed again!

43:47.208 --> 43:49.208
<i>Audhubillah min al shaitan nirajeem.</i>

43:49.291 --> 43:50.791
Dewo.

43:50.875 --> 43:52.708
I think he's also not a Muslim.

43:52.791 --> 43:54.291
I'm a Muslim!

43:54.375 --> 43:55.500
Allahu Akbar!

43:55.583 --> 43:57.708
It must be a Muslim jinn!

43:57.791 --> 44:00.333
I don't need exorcism! I'm not possessed!

44:00.416 --> 44:02.000
This has to be the Jinn's trick!

44:02.083 --> 44:04.083
- I'm not possessed!
- Squeeze his thumb!

44:04.166 --> 44:04.916
Yes, sir.

44:05.500 --> 44:07.958
- [snaps]
- [screaming]

44:08.041 --> 44:09.375
I meant his big toe, stupid!

44:09.458 --> 44:15.166
[Sugeng groaning]

44:15.958 --> 44:18.041
[playful music]

44:21.250 --> 44:22.166
Mom.

44:22.708 --> 44:25.000
This hot water is for me, right?

44:29.625 --> 44:31.291
TODAY: THURSDAY 13
TOMORROW: KLIWON FRIDAY

44:31.375 --> 44:32.416

[ominous music]

44:47.208 --> 44:48.125
Dear?

44:51.541 --> 44:52.458
Mom.

44:53.500 --> 44:55.958
I'm using the hot water for Dewo's bath.

45:12.083 --> 45:13.000
Dear?

45:14.875 --> 45:17.083
[ominous music continues]

45:33.958 --> 45:34.875
[gasps] Dear.

45:36.458 --> 45:38.916
Go. Go take a bath.

45:52.833 --> 45:54.625
Smells like blood.

45:57.791 --> 45:58.708
Dear.

45:59.500 --> 46:00.750
I'll get your towel, okay?

46:04.000 --> 46:05.708
[water splashing]

46:10.208 --> 46:12.375
[water splashing]

46:15.333 --> 46:16.375
Dewo is inside.

46:18.541 --> 46:20.041
What about my hot water?

46:20.125 --> 46:22.250
Ask Mom to heat some more.

46:23.916 --> 46:25.125
Dewo is using it.

46:25.208 --> 46:27.833
[clicks tongue] But that was for me.

46:27.916 --> 46:29.083
Don't fuss over it.

46:31.541 --> 46:32.458
[Dodit clicks tongue]

46:35.708 --> 46:36.625
Dear.

46:37.916 --> 46:39.583
Open up, here's your towel.

46:43.416 --> 46:44.333
Dewo.

46:45.416 --> 46:46.833

[ominous music]

46:58.166 --> 46:59.750
D… dear?

47:02.375 --> 47:03.375
Dewo?

47:05.458 --> 47:06.541
What's the matter?

47:07.791 --> 47:09.708
Did you see Dewo come home?

47:14.583 --> 47:18.458
- [stammering]
- Dewo is in the woods with Dad.

47:19.458 --> 47:20.916
He won't be back until dawn.

47:29.541 --> 47:30.541
- Mom.
- What?

47:34.708 --> 47:37.416
I saw him earlier.

47:40.208 --> 47:42.875
[ominous music intensifies, stops]

47:45.375 --> 47:47.166
[door clicks open, creaking]

47:48.791 --> 47:49.708
[door closes]

47:52.375 --> 47:53.625
Dewo?

47:53.708 --> 47:55.916
[footsteps approaching]

48:03.250 --> 48:04.291
Dad?

[screaming]

48:50.458 --> 48:52.333
What is it? Powder?

48:52.416 --> 48:55.250
- No! Your face!
- What is it?

48:58.041 --> 49:00.291
It's ash!

49:03.041 --> 49:04.666
What's this ruckus?

49:04.750 --> 49:06.208
I just saw a ghost.

49:06.291 --> 49:07.000
What?

49:07.083 --> 49:08.750
Are you sure it wasn't a dream?

49:08.833 --> 49:11.166
I know I saw it! Why would I lie?

49:12.708 --> 49:14.625
Calm down.

49:14.708 --> 49:16.208
Think about your baby.

49:17.166 --> 49:18.625
Calm down, okay?

49:18.708 --> 49:20.000
I feel uncomfortable here.

49:20.083 --> 49:21.000
[ominous music]

49:21.083 --> 49:23.500
Why is it that every Kliwon Friday night,

49:23.583 --> 49:25.416
something strange always happens?

49:26.541 --> 49:28.333
Are they going to make us
sacrificial offerings?

49:30.583 --> 49:31.958
[Lis] What?

49:34.666 --> 49:35.583
Hey.

49:36.833 --> 49:38.125
[in Javanese] Watch your mouth.

49:42.250 --> 49:44.208
- Sugeng, Kasno. Help me out.
- Yes, ma'am?

49:46.083 --> 49:47.666
Put these up around the house.

49:48.583 --> 49:51.166
[dramatic music]

49:54.791 --> 49:55.791
Put them up.

50:05.833 --> 50:06.750
How is it?

50:07.541 --> 50:09.833
- It's done, ma'am.
- Is it? Let me see.

50:11.250 --> 50:12.041
Gosh.

50:12.125 --> 50:13.250
Do it properly.

50:13.333 --> 50:14.250
Yes, ma'am.

50:15.250 --> 50:16.166
Lis.

50:23.750 --> 50:25.458
You'll be safe with this.

50:27.666 --> 50:28.583
Cute, right?

50:28.958 --> 50:30.583
Mom. Here.

50:30.916 --> 50:33.541
Okay. Apply it on the alley too.

50:35.083 --> 50:36.125
Apply it everywhere.

Okay.

TODAY: THURSDAY 17
TOMORROW: KLIWON FRIDAY

51:05.416 --> 51:06.333
Dad?

51:08.625 --> 51:09.625
What are you doing?

51:15.958 --> 51:17.166
Dear, what is this?

51:17.250 --> 51:20.916
At least I'm doing something
for our family.

51:21.458 --> 51:23.583
- I…
- You refused to go back.

51:23.666 --> 51:25.208
- Well…
- It's fine!

51:25.291 --> 51:28.083
If you're not going to, don't stop me
from doing what I have to do!

51:28.166 --> 51:29.916
- But…
- That's my condition.

51:35.666 --> 51:37.625
I didn't get to say anything.

51:39.833 --> 51:40.791
[metal clinks]

51:43.458 --> 51:45.791
[tender music]

[Joko in Javanese]
This is getting ridiculous, dear!

51:52.791 --> 51:54.500
[Dodit's mom in Javanese]
There's nothing wrong with being careful!

51:54.583 --> 51:55.958
There's nothing to lose!

51:56.041 --> 51:58.500
If you're away from home all day,

51:58.583 --> 52:00.875
who will protect me and the kids?

52:00.958 --> 52:04.166
[Joko] You know I'm on patrol
day and night!

52:04.250 --> 52:06.041
It's the cost of being a forest ranger.

52:06.125 --> 52:08.791
[Dodit's mom]
When will you protect your family?

52:08.875 --> 52:10.541
[Joko] What do you want?

52:10.625 --> 52:12.583
[Dodit's mom] I want to go home!

52:13.291 --> 52:16.000
I'm going home with the kids,
whether you like it or not!

52:16.083 --> 52:17.000
[Joko] No way!

52:17.708 --> 52:19.666
[Lis in Javanese]
Mom and Dad are always fighting.

52:20.458 --> 52:21.375
Let's just play, Dodit.

52:28.125 --> 52:31.791
[Dodit] I feel bad.

52:34.833 --> 52:40.291
Because of me, Mom couldn't go home.

52:43.125 --> 52:43.958
Dodit?

52:44.041 --> 52:46.125
[ominous music]

52:47.500 --> 52:49.541
He left his bag here?

52:50.416 --> 52:51.333
Dodit?

53:07.500 --> 53:09.041
[dripping sound]

53:16.125 --> 53:17.041

Mom! Dad!

53:25.833 --> 53:29.750
[screaming] Help! Mom!

53:30.333 --> 53:34.708
My gosh, Dodit still isn't home
at this hour.

53:35.208 --> 53:37.791
He's not anywhere around here.

53:38.375 --> 53:41.791
[Dodit's mom] What should we do, dear?

53:41.875 --> 53:43.708
He might be crashing at a friend's place.

53:43.791 --> 53:46.375
Don't be ridiculous!

53:46.458 --> 53:50.208
Since we moved here,
Dodit hasn't had any friends!

53:50.291 --> 53:52.708
He comes straight home after school!

53:55.291 --> 53:57.125
I think it's Mimin's ghost.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.291
Don't say the name or Mimin will show up.

54:00.625 --> 54:01.666
Huh?

54:01.750 --> 54:03.125

Don't just stand there!

54:07.708 --> 54:08.750
Dear.

54:09.291 --> 54:11.250
The boys and I
will look for Dodit in the woods.

54:11.333 --> 54:13.625
You and Lis stay here in case he returns.

54:14.791 --> 54:15.625
Come on, boys.

54:16.625 --> 54:18.916
[suspenseful music]

54:19.000 --> 54:20.750
Please find him, Dewo.

54:23.458 --> 54:24.791
Take care!

Dodit!

54:33.333 --> 54:34.833
[Dewo] You haven't seen him?

54:35.833 --> 54:36.833
No.

54:36.916 --> 54:39.333
If I had seen him, I would have told you.

54:40.708 --> 54:42.166
He couldn't have been kidnapped, right?

54:42.250 --> 54:45.083
Not a chance. It's safe here.

54:45.166 --> 54:48.041
People here would rather snatch wood
than people.

54:52.083 --> 54:53.208
Unless…

54:55.750 --> 54:58.250
the kidnapper…

55:01.000 --> 55:02.500
isn't human.

55:05.166 --> 55:06.583
You mean a ghost took Dodit away?

Everyone is looking for you.

I just saw a…

56:08.375 --> 56:09.791
[shushing]

56:11.041 --> 56:15.083
Keep quiet about whatever you see, okay?

56:15.166 --> 56:16.250
Shh.

56:18.041 --> 56:21.000
Don't tell anyone about it.

56:21.708 --> 56:25.791
Talking about it will only
make the singing man more pleased.

56:28.375 --> 56:30.083
[grunts]

56:30.166 --> 56:34.375
I have a little something for you.

56:34.458 --> 56:35.958
Keep it safe,

56:36.416 --> 56:38.250
and don't tell anyone.

56:38.750 --> 56:39.666
Okay?

[sobbing] Oh my God!

56:46.958 --> 56:49.500
[somber music]

56:50.208 --> 56:52.791
We shouldn't have told her so soon.

56:54.041 --> 56:58.375
[in Javanese]
Don't tell me Dodit was taken by a ghost!

56:59.000 --> 57:02.041
No, dear. Kasno was talking nonsense.

Pretty sure Mr. Joko is just milking this.

[Dewo shushes]

57:10.333 --> 57:11.333

[Dodit's mom sobs]

57:29.458 --> 57:31.791
Are you okay?

57:31.875 --> 57:33.583
Are you hurt? Are you injured?

57:34.916 --> 57:36.291
Where have you been?

57:36.375 --> 57:39.708
Everyone was looking for you!

57:39.791 --> 57:41.791
I was just taking a stroll.

57:43.000 --> 57:44.625
You've been missing since this afternoon!

57:45.166 --> 57:45.958
What?

57:46.750 --> 57:48.791
[in Javanese] This is why kids
shouldn't be out at night.

57:49.416 --> 57:53.000
I thought that was for pregnant women?

57:53.791 --> 57:54.833
He's talking back now.

57:55.833 --> 57:57.916
[Dodit's mom] You made me so worried.

57:58.000 --> 58:01.458
No more going out alone for you!

58:01.541 --> 58:03.166
Come straight home after school!

58:03.250 --> 58:05.708
Dewo can even come and pick you up.

58:06.750 --> 58:11.416
Promise me, okay?
You still want to buy a Tamiyo, right?

58:11.500 --> 58:13.750
Don't misbehave again.

58:14.625 --> 58:15.916
[groaning softly]

58:17.375 --> 58:19.625
What's the matter, Lis? Stomach cramps?

Take her to the hospital!

58:31.333 --> 58:32.666
No!

58:32.750 --> 58:34.416
Call a midwife! The hospital is too far!

- Right. Call a midwife!
- Boys, come with me!

[Dodit's mom] Now that you're a mother,

59:29.333 --> 59:32.041
you need to take better care of yourself.

59:32.791 --> 59:33.791
Mm.

59:35.416 --> 59:37.916
Being a woman is exhausting, Mom.

59:39.416 --> 59:41.791
As a wife, you have to do this.

59:42.250 --> 59:44.625
As a mother, you have to do that.

59:45.583 --> 59:48.166
But Dewo, as a father and husband,

59:48.958 --> 59:50.583
still has his good old life.

59:51.958 --> 59:53.875
[Dodit's mom] You always talk back.

59:54.583 --> 59:58.333
Looking after yourself
makes you more beautiful

59:59.333 --> 01:00:01.458
and clean.

01:00:03.291 --> 01:00:04.375
Like you?

01:00:06.541 --> 01:00:07.458
You know I'm right.

01:00:11.958 --> 01:00:12.791
Don't we look alike?

01:00:15.250 --> 01:00:17.791
My lovely grandchild.

01:00:18.166 --> 01:00:20.250
You're so handsome.

01:00:20.333 --> 01:00:21.458
She's a girl, Dad.

01:00:23.291 --> 01:00:24.833
But she could be handsome.

01:00:24.916 --> 01:00:28.291
You made me want to rush home
just to see you.

01:00:29.708 --> 01:00:31.000
[shushing]

01:00:31.083 --> 01:00:34.000
Dear! You're filthy from being outside.

01:00:34.083 --> 01:00:36.083
Take a bath and get changed first.

01:00:37.583 --> 01:00:40.458
All right. Gramps is going to take a bath.

01:00:40.541 --> 01:00:42.250
"Gramps"?

01:00:42.791 --> 01:00:45.666
At least make it "grandpa."
It sounds cooler.

01:00:46.208 --> 01:00:49.291
What "grandpa"?

01:00:49.833 --> 01:00:51.583
Only wealthy people get called "grandpa."

01:00:52.666 --> 01:00:55.708
My undershirt is full of holes.

01:00:56.083 --> 01:00:57.333
I'm going to take a bath.

01:00:58.250 --> 01:00:59.166
Holes.

01:00:59.541 --> 01:01:00.375
Holes.

01:01:01.458 --> 01:01:04.750
[Dodit's mom] Back off,
take a shower first.

01:01:04.833 --> 01:01:06.375

01:01:06.458 --> 01:01:10.708

01:02:23.916 --> 01:02:25.833
- [gasps]
- Dear.

01:02:26.708 --> 01:02:27.750
What's the matter?

01:02:27.833 --> 01:02:30.375
I saw something at the window…

01:02:30.458 --> 01:02:32.708
[baby crying]

01:02:35.375 --> 01:02:37.416

- [Dodit's mom cooing]
- [baby stops crying]

01:02:42.166 --> 01:02:44.541
[Dodit's mom] Hush now…

01:02:44.625 --> 01:02:46.166
What is it?

01:02:47.416 --> 01:02:48.958
Nothing, Mom.

01:02:49.833 --> 01:02:51.666
[tense music stops]

01:02:55.166 --> 01:02:56.708
[thunder rumbles]

01:02:57.750 --> 01:03:00.250
Dad. It's about to rain.

01:03:03.125 --> 01:03:05.416
Let's go back home to check on the house.

01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:06.541
Okay.

01:03:07.208 --> 01:03:10.291
Excuse me, sir.
So are we staying here, or…?

01:03:10.375 --> 01:03:11.625
You guys go ahead.

01:03:14.416 --> 01:03:17.041
If something happens, I'll let you…

01:03:17.125 --> 01:03:18.166
[motorbike revving]

01:03:18.250 --> 01:03:19.666
We're off, sir.

01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:21.166
The rain is truly a blessing.

01:03:24.125 --> 01:03:25.583
Those jerks.

01:03:25.666 --> 01:03:27.500
[thunder roars]

01:03:34.875 --> 01:03:37.125
[house gecko chirping]

01:03:43.416 --> 01:03:45.791

01:03:47.125 --> 01:03:49.208

01:03:52.791 --> 01:03:54.500
Mom!

01:03:54.958 --> 01:03:56.291
Mom! House geckos!

01:03:56.375 --> 01:03:58.083
- [panicking] House geckos!
- Oh my God.

01:03:59.541 --> 01:04:01.583
- Dodit, call Dad!
- Okay.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:04.875
What the heck?

01:04:05.791 --> 01:04:07.416
There's none on you.

01:04:13.375 --> 01:04:14.708
Dad, come inside.

01:04:14.791 --> 01:04:16.541
- What's happened?
- House geckos!

01:04:16.625 --> 01:04:18.791
Geckos are always around in the house.

01:04:18.875 --> 01:04:19.875
But there's a lot this time!

01:04:19.958 --> 01:04:22.083
- How many?
- The whole house is full of them! Come on!

01:04:22.166 --> 01:04:22.875
The whole house?

01:04:23.375 --> 01:04:24.666
[screaming]

01:04:27.208 --> 01:04:28.208
What's going on?

01:04:29.208 --> 01:04:30.583
These geckos are everywhere!

01:04:30.666 --> 01:04:32.250
I don't know where they came from!

01:04:34.583 --> 01:04:35.333
Mom?

01:04:35.416 --> 01:04:36.875
- [thunder roars]
- [shrieks]

01:04:36.958 --> 01:04:38.000
Calm down.

01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:39.916
I'll get the lights.

01:04:41.458 --> 01:04:43.458
- [thunder rumbles]
- [Lis and Dodit's mom whimper]

01:04:45.541 --> 01:04:46.708
[Dodit's mom] Stay close.

01:04:49.833 --> 01:04:51.250
[Joko] Is that you, Dodit?

01:04:51.333 --> 01:04:53.250
[Dodit] No, Dad. I'm with Mom.

01:04:53.333 --> 01:04:55.083
- Lis?
- No, Dad.

01:04:55.166 --> 01:04:56.375
[Joko] I can feel some long hair.

01:04:56.958 --> 01:04:58.000
Dear?

01:04:58.083 --> 01:05:00.666
[Dodit's mom] I can't hear you.
I'm in front of the house.

01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:02.375

[baby crying]

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:47.916
Your baby, Lis.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.666
- Yes.
- Huh?

01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:50.583
Go get her.

01:05:51.333 --> 01:05:52.625
[grunts]

01:05:53.708 --> 01:05:54.791
The geckos?

01:05:55.666 --> 01:05:56.750
I've cleaned them up, Dad.

01:05:59.625 --> 01:06:01.375

Dewo!

01:06:07.833 --> 01:06:10.458
Dewo! Our baby is gone!

01:06:15.291 --> 01:06:16.458
Where is she?

01:06:16.541 --> 01:06:20.083
I don't know! I was busy with the geckos!

01:06:20.166 --> 01:06:21.750
What should I do, Mom?

01:06:21.833 --> 01:06:24.208
[sobbing] Mom…

01:06:24.291 --> 01:06:27.083
Calm down. Let's find her together.

01:06:27.166 --> 01:06:28.750
- How?
- [baby cooing]

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:34.416
- She's a baby! She can't answer us!
- [baby keeps cooing]

01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:36.458
[Dodit's mom]
Had you listened to me and left,

01:06:36.541 --> 01:06:38.583
our grandchild wouldn't have vanished!

01:06:38.666 --> 01:06:40.000
- [baby gurgling]
- [Joko] Okay, I was wrong.

01:06:40.083 --> 01:06:41.666
But I had no choice!

01:06:42.416 --> 01:06:45.583
I'm doing this for you, Lis, and Dodit!

01:06:46.583 --> 01:06:48.000
Don't talk to me like that!

01:06:49.458 --> 01:06:52.416
If anything happens to our grandchild,

01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:54.875
I won't be able to forgive myself.

01:06:54.958 --> 01:06:56.666
I won't forgive you either!

01:06:56.750 --> 01:06:57.458
Enough!

01:06:59.208 --> 01:07:00.666
Everything will be fine.

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:02.458

Let's start searching, Mom.

01:07:02.541 --> 01:07:04.541
[baby gurgling]

01:07:05.833 --> 01:07:07.500
[Lis sobbing] We'll find her.

01:07:07.583 --> 01:07:08.958
- [Dodit's mom] All right.
- [Joko] Calm down.

01:07:09.041 --> 01:07:10.458
I'll go get the boys.

01:07:10.541 --> 01:07:13.083
- Our boys are here!
- My staff.

01:07:13.166 --> 01:07:14.291
Come with me, Dewo!

Sweetie, it's me!

[Dodit's mom whimpers]

01:08:14.333 --> 01:08:15.875

- My baby is missing.

01:08:15.958 --> 01:08:17.541
- Can you help us find her?
- Missing?

01:08:17.625 --> 01:08:18.458
Help us find her.

01:08:18.541 --> 01:08:19.875
Wait. Let me get my umbrella.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.458
- Yes?
- My child is missing.

01:08:22.541 --> 01:08:25.166
- I need help finding her.
- Okay, wait.

01:08:25.250 --> 01:08:26.333
Let's go!

01:08:26.416 --> 01:08:27.541
Wait, I'll lock the door.

01:08:27.625 --> 01:08:28.958
Let's go.

01:08:29.041 --> 01:08:31.500
[ominous music intensifies]

[ominous music stops]

01:08:36.375 --> 01:08:38.583
Thank goodness
we got to leave early today.

01:08:39.291 --> 01:08:41.958
Otherwise, we'd have to spend the night
at Mr. Joko's again.

01:08:42.875 --> 01:08:44.500
Not to mention it's Kliwon Friday night.

01:08:44.583 --> 01:08:45.708
[shudders]

01:08:45.791 --> 01:08:46.916
[knocking]

01:08:49.041 --> 01:08:50.666
- Someone's at the door.
- Open it.

01:08:51.416 --> 01:08:52.791
Watch out for ghosts.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.083
[thunder roars]

01:09:05.083 --> 01:09:06.333
No one's here.

01:09:07.625 --> 01:09:08.416
Huh?

01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:11.250
Sir? What's happened?
Why have you come here this late?

01:09:11.333 --> 01:09:13.250
- My grandchild is missing.
- What?

01:09:13.333 --> 01:09:14.875
Help me gather the people.

01:09:14.958 --> 01:09:16.125
Yes, sir. Please wait.

- Sugeng, wake up!
- [Sugeng mumbling]

Mr. Joko needs us.

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:25.958
[in Javanese] It's raining. It's cold.

01:09:26.791 --> 01:09:28.750
We don't even get paid for overtime.

01:09:29.375 --> 01:09:31.041
You can go alone.

01:09:31.791 --> 01:09:34.333
There's no end to their family problems.

01:09:35.333 --> 01:09:38.083
But it's an emergency!
His grandchild is missing!

01:09:38.166 --> 01:09:40.708
It was Dodit yesterday.
Now his grandchild.

01:09:40.791 --> 01:09:42.458
He'll run out of family members.

01:09:43.041 --> 01:09:44.958
[somber music]

01:09:46.625 --> 01:09:48.166
[sighs] But…

01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:50.875
Mrs. Joko even warned him about it.

01:09:51.750 --> 01:09:54.041
"Dear, this house is haunted."

01:09:54.125 --> 01:09:57.625
And for what? He refused to believe her.

01:09:58.375 --> 01:09:59.291
[sighs]

01:10:00.583 --> 01:10:02.166
I guess it's just you and me, Mr. Joko.

01:10:02.250 --> 01:10:04.250
[playful music]

01:10:07.041 --> 01:10:08.916
Kasno! This is an emergency!

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.750
He's missing his grandchild,
not a nail clipper!

01:10:11.166 --> 01:10:12.541
You weren't speaking clearly.

01:10:12.625 --> 01:10:14.125
Let's go, sir. I'll help you.

01:10:17.583 --> 01:10:19.166
I'll go with Kasno.

01:10:22.916 --> 01:10:24.625
Kasno! How can I help?

01:10:25.833 --> 01:10:27.125
I'll go with Mr. Joko.

01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:32.208
Sir! I might get fired.

01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:35.333
Sir! Sir!

01:10:35.416 --> 01:10:38.500
Everyone! Thank you for coming!

01:10:38.916 --> 01:10:42.416
I need your help tonight
to search for my grandchild.

01:10:42.958 --> 01:10:44.500
She is a baby.

01:10:45.083 --> 01:10:48.333
This group will follow
Kasno and Sugeng that way.

01:10:49.083 --> 01:10:51.041
The rest will follow me this way!

She's not even at the teak forest.

She must be upset

01:12:38.583 --> 01:12:41.500

01:13:18.541 --> 01:13:24.041
My spiritual abilities are limited.

01:13:25.083 --> 01:13:27.666
This is all I have.

01:13:28.916 --> 01:13:31.500

[in Javanese] My condolences.

You spent your life

devoted to Mimin.

Is he the man who loved Mimin?

He was…

01:24:52.208 --> 01:24:53.458
my ancestor.

01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:58.083
He always stayed here with Mimin

[Slamet] Mimin will always remain here.

01:25:23.333 --> 01:25:28.166
Yes, because her spirit has<i> nyawiji.</i>

Her spirit is one with the house.

01:25:35.208 --> 01:25:37.833
Especially that cell.

01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:43.583
For months, Mimin used
that cell for shelter.

01:25:45.541 --> 01:25:49.375
And so have the spirits
of the wood thieves.

01:25:49.708 --> 01:25:53.791
They were treated harshly by the Dutch.

01:25:56.083 --> 01:25:57.000

01:25:57.625 --> 01:25:59.583
It's just a rumor,

01:26:00.875 --> 01:26:06.166
but some of the thieves' remains were
dumped in the woods

01:26:06.250 --> 01:26:07.708
and left to rot.

01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:11.875
But to this day,

no skeletons have been discovered yet.

01:26:19.250 --> 01:26:20.166
And that's

01:26:21.083 --> 01:26:25.375
how brutal the Dutch were
during the colonization.

01:26:26.708 --> 01:26:27.625
During…

01:26:28.166 --> 01:26:29.750
[in unison]
…the colonization.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.458
Oh dear.

01:26:33.750 --> 01:26:34.791
So that's how it is.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.458
Mom.

01:26:39.541 --> 01:26:40.458
Thank you.

01:26:41.791 --> 01:26:45.083
For teaching me how to be a good mother.

01:26:45.625 --> 01:26:48.541
[tender music]

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.291
[in Javanese] You're welcome.

01:26:55.666 --> 01:26:57.500
I'm also still learning.

01:26:59.083 --> 01:27:01.875
There's no school for motherhood. Right?

01:27:13.250 --> 01:27:14.250
Lis.

01:27:14.333 --> 01:27:15.416
You've packed all the baby's clothes?

01:27:16.041 --> 01:27:17.583
Yeah, I got everything.

01:27:19.416 --> 01:27:22.333
[cooing] My baby is so beautiful.

01:27:24.541 --> 01:27:25.458
Dewo.

01:27:26.625 --> 01:27:27.500
What?

01:27:27.583 --> 01:27:28.500
Give me your hand.

01:27:29.791 --> 01:27:32.125
I'm just going inside for a bit.
Why should I give you my hand?

01:27:46.833 --> 01:27:49.375
Don't be sad, guys.

01:27:51.375 --> 01:27:52.958
No, we're not sad.

01:27:54.208 --> 01:27:56.416
I just caught a cold.

01:27:56.500 --> 01:27:57.458
[sniffling]

01:27:57.916 --> 01:28:00.250
You caught a cold? Get well soon.

01:28:01.916 --> 01:28:02.875
[sniffling]

01:28:09.458 --> 01:28:10.500
Mr. Joko!

01:28:11.375 --> 01:28:13.125
[wailing]

01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:20.458
Thank you, sir.

01:28:21.416 --> 01:28:24.083
For everything you taught us.

01:28:25.458 --> 01:28:29.750
I'm sorry if I offended you
or your family in any way.

01:28:30.166 --> 01:28:31.500
That's right, sir.

01:28:31.583 --> 01:28:34.500
Please forgive Sugeng.

01:28:35.708 --> 01:28:36.791
Mmm.

01:28:36.875 --> 01:28:37.791
It's okay.

01:28:38.625 --> 01:28:40.750
I know my family went missing often.

01:28:40.833 --> 01:28:42.625
[music turns sour]

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.541
Don't say that, sir.

01:28:44.625 --> 01:28:46.833
I was only joking yesterday.

01:28:46.916 --> 01:28:49.125
[tender music continues]

01:28:49.208 --> 01:28:51.375
[Dodit's mom]<i></i>Dodit!
Did you get your stuff?

01:28:51.458 --> 01:28:52.375
I did!

01:28:52.916 --> 01:28:56.416
Thank you for being there for Mr. Joko.

01:28:56.500 --> 01:28:58.333
- Yes, ma'am.
- Please forgive him too, Sugeng.

01:28:58.416 --> 01:29:01.291
When you got possessed,
Kasno hit you to wake you up.

01:29:01.875 --> 01:29:04.375
Forgive him, okay? Get along.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:05.916
Huh?

01:29:12.333 --> 01:29:14.000
[Sugeng] This isn't over
between us, Kasno!

01:29:14.083 --> 01:29:15.541
[Kasno] Can we do this later?

01:29:16.916 --> 01:29:18.541
[Dodit's mom] Bye all!

01:29:18.625 --> 01:29:21.375
[tender violin playing]

01:29:44.333 --> 01:29:45.250
[sighs]

01:29:45.625 --> 01:29:48.916
That's how it was
living in Dad's haunted house for a year.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.416
What do you think? Scary, right?

01:29:51.208 --> 01:29:53.625
That's why I grew up to be a brave man.

01:29:54.583 --> 01:29:57.458
I'm not scared of ghosts and such.

01:29:57.541 --> 01:29:59.375
No big deal. [chuckles]

01:29:59.458 --> 01:30:02.750
[ominous music]

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.375
- Mom.
- Yeah?

01:30:36.458 --> 01:30:38.125
You're going to get me a Tamiyo, right?

01:30:38.750 --> 01:30:39.666
Of course.

01:30:40.083 --> 01:30:41.000
Five?

01:30:43.208 --> 01:30:44.125
Sure.

01:30:44.708 --> 01:30:47.500
But you'll have to
stay in that house again.

01:30:48.541 --> 01:30:49.583
Just one is fine.

01:30:50.375 --> 01:30:51.291
[chuckles]

01:30:51.791 --> 01:30:53.250
[tender music]

01:30:53.333 --> 01:30:55.000
- Here's the store.
- Yes!

01:30:56.208 --> 01:30:56.958
Mom, look at the Tamiyo.

01:30:57.041 --> 01:30:59.875
Wow. What's this?

01:31:03.458 --> 01:31:04.625
We'd like a Tamiyo car, please.

01:31:10.875 --> 01:31:11.791
This one, please.

01:31:17.916 --> 01:31:21.166
Here's the money, miss. Exact change.

01:31:21.916 --> 01:31:23.541
Just give it to my son directly.

01:31:24.708 --> 01:31:27.000
Dodit. I'm going next door
to buy some food.

01:31:27.083 --> 01:31:28.416
- Okay.
- Catch up with me after.

01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:30.250
- Okay.
- Please look after him, miss.

01:31:35.291 --> 01:31:36.333
Thank you, miss.

01:31:39.250 --> 01:31:41.625
[ominous music builds up]

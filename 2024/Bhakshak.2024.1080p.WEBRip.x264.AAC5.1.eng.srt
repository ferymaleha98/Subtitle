3
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:29,541
Motherfucker! What are you looking at?

4
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:30,500
Get lost!

5
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,250
Weren't you supposed to just deflower her?

6
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,958
She wasn't letting me do it.

7
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:59,250
She was acting as if she was some heroine.

8
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:05,625
I tried, but she started screaming.

9
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,791
I tried to gag her with my hand,

10
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:12,125
but the bloody thing bit my finger.

11
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:14,375
Then?

12
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,041
Then what?

13
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,208
It pissed me off.

14
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:18,791
What did you do then?

15
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:21,333
Then I got mad, went into the kitchen,

16
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:23,875
brought chili powder,
and shoved it up her...

17
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:26,333
Motherfucker.

18
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,166
Do you think it's funny?

19
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:38,666
Hello, doctor.

20
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,083
Sonu here.

21
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,166
You know that idiot Pappu Thekedar.

22
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:45,125
He was trying to deflower a girl.

23
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,250
But things went a little south

24
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,500
and he stuffed chili powder in her...

25
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:54,250
Who's going to get ice at 3:00 a.m.?

26
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:56,625
I'll bring her over.

27
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:09,541
What did the doctor say?

28
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,125
Hold her tight. Grab her properly.

29
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:17,833
Be quiet!

30
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,500
Hey, <i>Dom</i>!

31
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:04,958
What?

32
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,208
Come here.

33
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,041
There's a girl's body in the boot.

34
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,416
Cremate the body quickly.

35
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,291
What is her name?

36
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,166
Who will light the pyre?

37
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,583
He will. He has got a fire burning inside.

38
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:36,791
Why would I?

39
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:38,333
I won't cremate her.

40
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,750
Will anyone tell me
what caste or clan she belongs to?

41
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,500
She's an orphan, motherfucker.

42
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,791
Cremate the body. I'll pay for it.

43
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:49,666
Listen, <i>Dom</i>.

44
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,541
This is Mr. Bansi's property.

45
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:58,791
We never came here,

46
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,791
nor did you cremate any girl.

47
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,375
Understood?

48
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,291
{\an8}Yes, Guptaji.

49
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,416
{\an8}<i>Hello, madam.</i>

50
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,250
{\an8}<i>Meet me under the Rajendra Nagar flyover
in 30 minutes.</i>

51
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,750
{\an8}At this hour--

52
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,250
{\an8}Hello?

53
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,500
{\an8}Good morning, madam.

54
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,875
{\an8}Here you go.

55
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:03,625
{\an8}What is this?

56
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,958
{\an8}This news is worth chasing.

57
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:07,708
{\an8}What do you mean?

58
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,291
{\an8}It's a social audit report.

59
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:13,041
{\an8}A survey was conducted
in the state's children's shelter homes.

60
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,833
{\an8}There's a report of girls
being physically abused

61
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,083
{\an8}in the girls' shelter home of Munawwarpur.

62
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,958
{\an8}See if this news is of any good to you.

63
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,125
{\an8}Come on, Guptaji.

64
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:28,791
{\an8}You woke me up in the morning for this?

65
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:30,291
{\an8}Keep it.

66
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:33,083
{\an8}This is the problem
with reporters like you.

67
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:36,166
{\an8}If you knew,
you would be a national-level reporter.

68
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,083
{\an8}I'm handing you
the state government's head on a platter,

69
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,125
{\an8}but you don't get it.

70
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,000
{\an8}I am a reporter, Guptaji, not a cop.
Understood?

71
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:51,250
{\an8}But if the cops had taken action,
we wouldn't have to do anything.

72
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:53,250
{\an8}What do you mean?

73
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:56,041
{\an8}It has been two months
since the report is out.

74
00:07:57,041 --> 00:08:00,708
{\an8}The government, police, and administration
won't lift a finger.

75
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:04,375
{\an8}You can take this news
or I'll give it to the BND News channel.

76
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,333
{\an8}What are you thinking, madam?

77
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:08,583
{\an8}What if it's fake?

78
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,958
{\an8}You can investigate first and pay later.

79
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,250
{\an8}How much?

80
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:15,791
{\an8}51,000 rupees.

81
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,291
{\an8}Have you lost your mind, Guptaji?

82
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,583
{\an8}Where will I get 51,000? You keep it.

83
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,791
{\an8}- Madam...
- No, I don't want it.

84
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,750
{\an8}Money isn't a factor between us.

85
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,958
{\an8}We'll discuss it later. Take it.

86
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,541
{\an8}And if this news is fake,
then you better say your prayers.

87
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,041
{\an8}I am not going anywhere.

88
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:54,666
<i>During the social audit
of all the shelter homes in our state,</i>

89
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,541
<i>we took a closer look at all
the children's shelter homes in the state.</i>

90
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:02,333
<i>That's when the girls' shelter home
in Munawwarpur drew our attention.</i>

91
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,416
<i>We request the state government</i>

92
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,291
<i>to form an investigation committee</i>

93
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,916
<i>to bring about reforms</i>

94
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,250
<i>in their management and conditions.</i>

95
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,166
But where did you find Gupta?

96
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,041
He's a big-time scoundrel.

97
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:19,625
{\an8}Bloody Traitor.

98
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:25,500
Remember how he gave you that fake news
against the chief minister last time?

99
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,500
And also charged you 10,000 rupees.

100
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:32,875
{\an8}You've got it easy.
You are a female reporter.

101
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,750
Anything you say slides with the audience.
I almost got thrashed last time.

102
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,916
Are you even listening
to what I am saying?

103
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,791
I am, Mr. Bhaskar, but unfortunately,

104
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,041
the way things are going,

105
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,041
we'll have to shut down
the studio in six months.

106
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,625
Then we'll both be sitting idle.

107
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,208
{\an8}Now, are you listening to what I'm saying?

108
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:52,541
Do I have a choice?

109
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,541
Look, Mr. Bhaskar, I am making an effort.

110
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,291
And making an effort
is better than just sitting idle.

111
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,500
Did you find a news reader?

112
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:01,750
Do we have tea leaves?

113
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,500
I am asking you
if you found a news reader.

114
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,375
This is an office, not a kitchen.

115
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,625
I'll find someone soon.

116
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,750
{\an8}You've been giving that excuse
for a week now.

117
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,833
If you're done eating,
can we do some work?

118
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:13,833
What?

119
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,166
No, I'll wait.

120
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,541
- I'm all ready.
- No, it's all right.

121
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,416
Wait just a minute.

122
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,833
- Wait, look here. Look this way.
- Okay.

123
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,875
Is my face too glossy?

124
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:27,958
Not at all.

125
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,208
Okay.

126
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,500
What do I do about these headphones?

127
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:33,791
{\an8}I'm using wires from the table lamp
to keep it together.

128
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,458
{\an8}Only one side works.

129
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:36,958
{\an8}Now say "hello".

130
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,083
{\an8}Hello! One-two...

131
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,916
- Can you hear me?
- Loud and clear.

132
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,458
Much better.

133
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,125
- Okay...
- Roll.

134
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:44,916
Action.

135
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,541
Hello! This is Vaishali Singh
from Koshish News, Patna.

136
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,708
Firstly, the headlines for today.

137
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:53,458
Patna Police have seized
large amounts of fake liquor last night.

138
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:57,000
Two brothers in Darbhanga
shot each other over a property row.

139
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:01,458
A dog and a bitch got married in Munger,
and the guests were overjoyed.

140
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,250
Why haven't you started yet?

141
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,083
Vaishali.

142
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,458
Will you pay the electricity bill
or should I?

143
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:13,541
I'll pay for it.

144
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,041
Just give me the money.

145
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:17,958
Okay.

146
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:22,958
What's new in the state, madam reporter?

147
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,333
Winter has set in.

148
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,166
Oranges have arrived in the market,

149
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,416
unemployment among youth
is on the rise, and--

150
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,125
And the government is silent.

151
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,708
I've been hearing this
since my college days.

152
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,875
You reported this three years ago.

153
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:37,416
The government stayed silent back then

154
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,625
and even now.

155
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,750
We give five years to the government
to bring some change.

156
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,875
I'll get only three?

157
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,208
What will I achieve in three years?

158
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,666
Look, Vaishali,
you said this three years ago.

159
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,041
That you'll set up your channel
in two years.

160
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:57,583
Now we're in the fourth year.

161
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,416
I know this is the fourth year, Arvind.

162
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:00,875
What should I do?

163
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,875
Take up a job in some big channel again?

164
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,666
Suck up to everyone?

165
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,000
Wait for that big scoop to arrive?

166
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,125
I can't do all this.

167
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:14,666
You're not getting anywhere
in this job either.

168
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,375
Okay. Stop.

169
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,416
Stop.

170
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,125
This seems to be the place.

171
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,125
I'll ask that tea vendor.

172
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:11,916
GIRLS' SHELTER HOME, MUNAWWARPUR

173
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:20,916
JAN SEVA DAL

174
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,208
GIRLS' SHELTER HOME, MUNAWWARPUR

175
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:34,416
Hey!

176
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:36,500
What are you doing?

177
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,583
Why are you taking pictures?

178
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,625
Mister.

179
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,083
Which way is Amar Cinema?

180
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,250
It has been five years
since Amar Cinema shut down.

181
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,041
Well, I was looking for a tour and travel...

182
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,041
This is a private lane, understood?

183
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,000
Trespassers are not allowed.

184
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,666
- Now leave.
- What?

185
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,000
I said leave.

186
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,208
Why is this a private lane?

187
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,125
I'll serve it.

188
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:37,791
Here.

189
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,625
What number is it on, Vaishali?

190
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,500
My brother-in-law,
you only watch my channel when I am here.

191
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,875
It's 603 in Patna,
you'd know what number it is out here.

192
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,708
It must be 603 here too.

193
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:51,041
It's not like that...

194
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,083
Scan the channels.

195
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:55,916
<i>Let's meet the students and the teachers.</i>

196
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,458
<i>Are you the teacher?</i>

197
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:58,625
<i>No, sir, I'm a student.</i>

198
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,500
<i>What are you studying?</i>

199
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,083
<i>I'm pursuing my graduation.</i>

200
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,916
<i>Home Science, second year.</i>

201
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,166
<i>And he's your son?</i>

202
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,083
<i>- Are you here to meet your dad?
- No, he's my classmate.</i>

203
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,416
<i>The state government's love
for the youth is pretty unique.</i>

204
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:18,583
<i>Normally, it takes three years
to complete graduation in other states.</i>

205
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:24,000
<i>But sometimes in our State University,
it takes six to seven years.</i>

206
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,166
<i>It is good</i>

207
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,125
<i>when the youngsters
won't remain in their youth phase anymore.</i>

208
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,708
<i>There won't be
any youth unemployment left.</i>

209
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:33,166
<i>The youth of Bihar
have so much time to spare,</i>

210
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,125
<i>they are following us around.</i>

211
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:41,375
You seem pretty concerned
about unemployed young men.

212
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,333
What is your opinion about yourself?

213
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:47,416
I mean, who's going to watch your channel

214
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,833
for this kind of news?

215
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:55,083
What suddenly brings you to Munawwarpur?

216
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,375
I had some work.

217
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,500
I had to meet someone.

218
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,166
How are your studies coming along?

219
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,416
Good.

220
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,958
She misses you.

221
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,291
Even I miss her.

222
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,750
She's like my daughter.

223
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,125
She's like your daughter,

224
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,833
but she's my daughter.

225
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,916
When will you decide
on expanding your family?

226
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:25,125
Madam Vaishali,
I'll wait outside in the car.

227
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:30,791
There are complications in getting
pregnant after a certain age, Vaishali.

228
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,250
And you've been married for six years.

229
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,791
I'll wait for a couple more years
and set up my work.

230
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,291
Then we'll see.

231
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,375
It's not like I am missing some train.

232
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:43,916
The thing about work is that

233
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,791
you can set it up at any time.

234
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,458
And it doesn't matter even if you don't.

235
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,833
You must have a baby.

236
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,416
She's acting like a baby herself.

237
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,750
Imagine your life without a child.

238
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,791
{\an8}Listen.

239
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,666
I have no information
about any such report.

240
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:11,583
What are you trying to do, Vaishali?

241
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,583
I am just trying to find out.

242
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,250
It has been two months
since the report is out.

243
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:18,708
Why is the government tight-lipped?

244
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:19,791
The government--

245
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:24,083
I mean, when the state government
has ordered this audit,

246
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,541
then why hasn't any investigation
been carried out?

247
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,541
Don't you find it strange, Mr. Mithilesh?

248
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:34,458
I think CWC should verify this report.

249
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,208
This is your responsibility too.

250
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,125
Of course.

251
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,583
This is our responsibility as well.

252
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,125
I am not running away from it.

253
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:48,708
Look, Vaishali, I'm not saying
there shouldn't be any investigation.

254
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,583
In fact, there should be an investigation.

255
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,625
An open, serious investigation.

256
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,750
But there is a system for everything.

257
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,125
And the government is bound
by its formalities.

258
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,625
First, an investigation will happen,

259
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,750
and then the government
will complete its formalities

260
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,208
and send the file to us.

261
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:09,625
How long will it take
to complete these formalities?

262
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,208
Young girls are being exploited.

263
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,041
It's right in front of you.
You have read it.

264
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,291
Read what?

265
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,708
You brought this.

266
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,083
The government didn't send me this.

267
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,791
When the government sends me the file

268
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,666
and if after reading that file, I feel

269
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,208
the children are being treated unfairly,

270
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,375
then I won't just sit quietly.

271
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:36,416
I have two cute little daughters.

272
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,000
I am a dad myself.

273
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,208
Have faith in time. Be patient.

274
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,291
And watch the administration
work its magic.

275
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,041
These things take time,

276
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,375
but everything is fixed
in the end. Goodbye.

277
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,041
I've given you my card.

278
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,666
Please inform us if you find out anything.

279
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:12,583
Hello.

280
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:13,958
<i>Am I talking to Arvind?</i>

281
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:15,583
Yes.

282
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:18,541
<i>Hello! This is Bansi Sahu,
from Munawwarpur.</i>

283
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:23,166
Yes, hello! Sorry, I didn't recognize you.

284
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,208
<i>You didn't?</i>

285
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,791
<i>Never mind.
I don't know you so well either.</i>

286
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,916
My goodness.
Did the sun rise from the west today?

287
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,750
Did you come to welcome me?

288
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,291
{\an8}What are you reporting lately?

289
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,125
{\an8}What is this girls' shelter home
that you are investigating?

290
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,000
You thought I wouldn't find out?

291
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,625
Some Bansi Sahu had called me.

292
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:18,333
Who is Bansi Sahu?

293
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,000
You don't get it, Vaishali.

294
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,583
I've asked my brother-in-law
and he said that guy is a bastard.

295
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,583
Tell me what you wish to do.

296
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,875
Arvind, I don't know
which Bansi Sahu called you

297
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,625
and what he said.

298
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,458
I'm just doing my job, that's all.

299
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:35,791
- Doing your job?
- Yes.

300
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:38,625
Vaishali, I've always supported you.

301
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,250
I am an ordinary man.
I can't take on these people.

302
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,916
- Understood?
- Why are you getting mad at me, Arvind?

303
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,541
I don't understand what's wrong.

304
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:46,666
Give me the car keys.

305
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,750
Keys.

306
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:54,416
You won't take the car starting tomorrow.

307
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,291
I don't want your car.

308
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:01,666
Vaishali!

309
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:13,291
ONLY RASCALS SPIT HERE

310
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,500
<i>Bansi Sahu runs three newspapers.</i>

311
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,625
Navyug, Munawwarpur.

312
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:18,708
News, Munawwarpur.

313
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,041
And Siyasat-e-Bihar.

314
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,208
The majority
of the state government's official ads

315
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,250
are published in his newspapers.

316
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:30,833
Fun fact, he takes 60,000 papers
from the state government

317
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,416
on subsidized rates
and prints only three copies.

318
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,041
It's a total scam.

319
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,791
The shelter home in Munawwarpur
belongs to him

320
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:40,083
and he's also connected with several NGOs.

321
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:46,125
Also, the chief minister
attended his son's birthday party.

322
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,291
He has contested the elections twice
but never won.

323
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:53,125
Don't you think you should have
informed me about this earlier, Guptaji?

324
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:56,166
He has already called my husband
because of you.

325
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,416
And the point is,

326
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,708
if all this is government-affiliated,

327
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:05,000
then he must have
the government's support.

328
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,541
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

329
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,458
That's why he has suppressed the report.

330
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:10,958
Once his secret is exposed,
everyone will get looped in.

331
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:12,041
Each and every one.

332
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,250
What are you reporters for?

333
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:14,958
Expose them.

334
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,541
Yes. Expose them? Upon your order?

335
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:19,750
And challenge the government?

336
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:22,916
Then why don't you sell some snacks
on the streets instead

337
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,541
or open a grocery store?

338
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,458
- Why bother with journalism?
- Don't teach us

339
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:27,791
- what we must do!
- Mr. Bhaskar!

340
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:29,375
- He's being absurd.
- Mr. Bhaskar!

341
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:32,416
Deposit 25,000 in his account.

342
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,916
25,000 is too little, madam.

343
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,416
I know, Guptaji. But soon.

344
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,708
Right now, take this.

345
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:38,250
My wedding date is close.

346
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:39,791
Are you getting married at this age?

347
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:41,833
Any kind of pressure?
Is someone forcing you to get married?

348
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:46,000
- I need it, sir.
- Look, Guptaji, we're quite stressed.

349
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:57,416
<i>The conditions of the girls living
in Munawwarpur is a matter of concern.</i>

350
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:03,791
<i>Deep gashes can be seen
on some of the girls living there.</i>

351
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:07,208
<i>When we spoke with the girls,</i>

352
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:10,416
<i>some of them told us
about the physical abuse they faced.</i>

353
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,916
<i>Several of them
were so afraid of the management</i>

354
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,083
<i>that they didn't even speak.</i>

355
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,750
<i>The girls living there told us</i>

356
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:24,208
<i>that they have been
physically abused several times.</i>

357
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,375
<i>And they see no signs of help.</i>

358
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:34,375
<i>Many of them believed that several girls
who were living with them had disappeared</i>

359
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:36,541
<i>or maybe they were killed.</i>

360
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,000
JAN SEVA DAL

361
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:09,958
KHUSHI SHELTER HOME, PATNA,
ANUMAYA HUMAN RESOURCE FOUNDATION

362
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:13,166
Even our organization is recognized
by the state government.

363
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:16,416
Through the police or any other medium,

364
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:21,125
when we learn there is
some helpless girl in the area,

365
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:26,333
or alone,
or battling some kind of a problem,

366
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:28,458
then we rescue her.

367
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:30,666
We'll bring her here, counsel her,

368
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,500
and get a medical checkup done.

369
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:37,208
We'll send the medical report
to the Child Welfare Committee.

370
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:39,708
The girl is our responsibility.

371
00:24:39,791 --> 00:24:44,958
Food, clothing, education, and medical...

372
00:24:45,041 --> 00:24:47,166
We take on all these responsibilities

373
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:51,166
and spend from the funds
we get from the government.

374
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:54,416
Up to what age can these girls stay here?

375
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,458
I mean...

376
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:57,875
Is there any rule or age limit?

377
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:01,666
We can only keep those
under the age of 18.

378
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,041
When they are old enough
to go someplace else,

379
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:07,208
we either shift them

380
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:11,250
or send them to a different shelter home
for various other reasons.

381
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:14,791
Do girls from other shelter homes
come here?

382
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:19,083
Yes, girls from Gaya, Bihar Sharif...

383
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:20,500
And Munawwarpur?

384
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:24,541
No, we never had any case
from Munawwarpur.

385
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:27,875
Where are the girls from
the Munawwarpur girls' shelter home sent?

386
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:31,291
Try to understand the chronology here.

387
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:34,291
All these little organizations

388
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:37,166
are governed by one ministry or another.

389
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,208
Do you understand?

390
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:41,291
And the one we're examining,
the girls' shelter home,

391
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:43,333
comes under social welfare.

392
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:47,000
They monitor it
and provide them with enough funds.

393
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,666
I have an idea.

394
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:53,125
The Social Welfare Department minister
is Rajni Singh.

395
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:54,541
Her office is in the Secretariat.

396
00:25:54,625 --> 00:25:56,416
Let's go pay her a visit. Finish your tea.

397
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,375
- How's the idea?
- It's stupid.

398
00:25:58,875 --> 00:25:59,750
Why is it stupid?

399
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:02,833
Don't you think the Social Welfare
Department already has this report?

400
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:06,541
The report arrived two months ago
and they haven't done a thing.

401
00:26:06,625 --> 00:26:08,208
Why will they act now upon our request?

402
00:26:08,291 --> 00:26:09,791
Think of something else, Mr. Bhaskar.

403
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:11,833
This world is a complicated place.

404
00:26:11,916 --> 00:26:14,291
I can't think of anything else.
You have to come up with something.

405
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:15,541
Where do we go from here?

406
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:18,583
KOSHISH NEWS

407
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:25,083
Mr. Bhaskar...

408
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:31,125
Would you like to have tea
with Bansi Sahu?

409
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:37,166
{\an8}<i>In October 2017,</i>

410
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:41,250
{\an8}the state government
officially appointed NISS,

411
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:46,166
{\an8}the Noble Institute of Social Studies,
to conduct a social audit

412
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:49,375
{\an8}of all shelter homes that come
under the Social Welfare Department.

413
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:54,291
NISS has mentioned several
shelter homes in their report,

414
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:57,916
but their main focus was
on the girls' shelter home of Munawwarpur.

415
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,708
<i>What needs attention is that NISS
submitted the report two months ago,</i>

416
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:06,500
<i>and the state government
hasn't taken any action in this matter.</i>

417
00:27:07,041 --> 00:27:11,333
<i>We're curious to know
if there's any truth in the NISS report.</i>

418
00:27:11,416 --> 00:27:14,916
<i>Is the state government's
silence justified?</i>

419
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,750
This is Vaishali Singh with the cameraman,
Bhaskar Sinha, for Koshish News, Patna.

420
00:27:29,541 --> 00:27:31,083
Look, he's doing yoga.

421
00:27:31,166 --> 00:27:33,416
It's not yoga.

422
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,875
It's a votive for the goddess.

423
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:47,875
Stay seated.

424
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:49,041
{\an8}You're embarrassing me.

425
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,375
{\an8}Stay seated.

426
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:58,291
So...

427
00:28:01,291 --> 00:28:02,375
Yes.

428
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:08,750
She's my daughter, Puja.

429
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:11,166
- Say hello.
- Hello.

430
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,458
She's a popular reporter in Patna.

431
00:28:14,916 --> 00:28:16,208
She's doing her BA in English.

432
00:28:16,875 --> 00:28:17,875
Go, child.

433
00:28:25,166 --> 00:28:27,666
You've been targeting me.

434
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,000
I am not targeting you, sir.

435
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:34,166
I'm trying to find out the truth

436
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,166
and there's nothing wrong with that.

437
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,750
Define wrong.

438
00:28:39,041 --> 00:28:42,708
Every wrong thing in this world
is right in their own opinion.

439
00:28:42,791 --> 00:28:44,416
There is no such thing as wrong.

440
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,291
Wrong is when you
intentionally malign someone,

441
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:50,500
which you're doing.

442
00:28:51,291 --> 00:28:55,583
I knew it the day
when you were asking about me in the city.

443
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:57,125
Mithilesh informed me.

444
00:28:57,875 --> 00:28:59,791
You went to the CWC?

445
00:28:59,875 --> 00:29:01,708
I called your husband directly.

446
00:29:02,291 --> 00:29:03,916
He seemed like a decent man.

447
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,750
It was a pleasure talking to him.

448
00:29:05,833 --> 00:29:08,750
Arvind works at the post office,
doesn't he?

449
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:12,791
Six years of marriage, imagine.

450
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:15,583
It doesn't look that way.

451
00:29:15,666 --> 00:29:17,666
You still look so young.

452
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:23,083
Although I don't call anyone so soon,

453
00:29:23,166 --> 00:29:24,375
but I did.

454
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:27,916
I clearly told him
that if you have any questions,

455
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,375
you could ask me directly.

456
00:29:30,875 --> 00:29:33,000
But madam, you went two steps ahead of me.

457
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:37,625
You broadcast the news last night.

458
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:43,125
How many people watch your news anyway?

459
00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:46,541
In fact,
I've watched the repeat show myself.

460
00:29:47,041 --> 00:29:48,666
Why are you doing this?

461
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:53,000
I am a reporter.

462
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:57,916
If I see something that's not right,

463
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,541
then it's my duty to follow up on it
and that's what I am doing.

464
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:03,291
Why are you getting annoyed, madam?
Even I am a reporter.

465
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:06,416
If I publish something
in the newspaper about you,

466
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,375
you won't be worth anything.

467
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:13,416
My newspaper
has a bigger reach than yours.

468
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,125
And I'll publish it
in all three languages.

469
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:17,000
Hindi, Urdu, English.

470
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:25,458
You see, Vaishali,

471
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,791
if some cyclist gets run over
by an oncoming truck,

472
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:35,250
then that's an accident.

473
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:39,541
But if someone
throws himself under the truck,

474
00:30:39,625 --> 00:30:41,041
then that's suicide.

475
00:30:45,291 --> 00:30:47,250
You have other members in your family.

476
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,750
Why do you wish to get into trouble?

477
00:30:53,958 --> 00:30:55,166
My name is Bansi.

478
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:58,125
I'm not a flute that you'll play.

479
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:05,000
Next time when you come over,
you can also have some tea.

480
00:31:05,541 --> 00:31:07,041
- Sonu.
- Yes.

481
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:09,041
Show madam reporter the way out.

482
00:31:09,125 --> 00:31:10,125
Come.

483
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:17,375
Come.

484
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:49,875
See you tomorrow.

485
00:33:22,541 --> 00:33:23,750
What time is it?

486
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:28,875
I've been waiting
for over two hours, Vaishali,

487
00:33:28,958 --> 00:33:30,166
and I haven't had a morsel of food.

488
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:34,708
Give me five minutes.
I'll make some porridge.

489
00:33:37,041 --> 00:33:38,208
This is great!

490
00:33:38,291 --> 00:33:40,708
Work hard the entire day
and eat porridge at night.

491
00:33:44,666 --> 00:33:46,041
Just tell me what you want to eat.

492
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,958
I'll make it.

493
00:33:48,041 --> 00:33:49,250
Make what?

494
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:52,291
Have you lost your mind?

495
00:33:53,166 --> 00:33:56,208
Have you seen the time?
You're always busy working!

496
00:33:56,291 --> 00:33:57,500
You don't care about your family.

497
00:33:58,791 --> 00:33:59,708
Why are you yelling?

498
00:33:59,791 --> 00:34:01,416
What do you expect me to do?

499
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,583
{\an8}- Rub your feet?
- Did I ask you to rub my feet?

500
00:34:06,166 --> 00:34:08,458
I don't have a problem with your job.

501
00:34:08,541 --> 00:34:10,666
But I have a problem with your methods.

502
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:13,708
I make enough money,

503
00:34:13,791 --> 00:34:16,791
- so you don't have to do such petty work--
- Don't call my work petty, Arvind.

504
00:34:18,416 --> 00:34:20,083
I do it for my passion, not for the money.

505
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:21,458
Get that straight!

506
00:34:21,541 --> 00:34:23,500
- Have you fulfilled your passion?
- No, I haven't! Tell me!

507
00:34:30,416 --> 00:34:34,625
Bansi Sahu is abusing those girls.
Why don't you understand, Arvind?

508
00:34:34,708 --> 00:34:37,083
{\an8}Is anyone abusing our child? No!

509
00:34:37,166 --> 00:34:38,583
{\an8}Then why are you getting emotional?

510
00:34:38,666 --> 00:34:40,791
Do you know what the problem is?

511
00:34:41,375 --> 00:34:43,166
People like you
with such disgusting mentality.

512
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,583
- That's the problem.
- Be quiet!

513
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:46,583
{\an8}I won't stay quiet. You be quiet!

514
00:34:49,291 --> 00:34:52,041
{\an8}No one speaks up
when someone else is being mistreated.

515
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:54,083
But remember, Arvind,

516
00:34:54,166 --> 00:34:57,083
that someday,
your child will get abused too.

517
00:34:57,166 --> 00:34:58,791
So we must speak up, Arvind!

518
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:03,291
You can wait until you are victimized,
but I won't!

519
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,291
And if you are hungry,
is it my fault that you haven't eaten?

520
00:35:14,375 --> 00:35:17,333
All you have to do is boil a cup of rice
and lentils in the pressure cooker.

521
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:19,041
Can't you do that much? Are you a child?

522
00:35:21,625 --> 00:35:24,500
If you feel hungry,
then better learn to cook, Arvind.

523
00:35:28,791 --> 00:35:34,666
You and your family
keep persuading me to have a child

524
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:38,291
and expand the family.
I beg you to stop urging me.

525
00:35:38,375 --> 00:35:41,000
I will have a child
when I am ready for it.

526
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:43,625
I won't quit everything for it.

527
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:48,000
If you're getting desperate
to have a child,

528
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,500
then marry someone else, but spare me!

529
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,541
When did I nag you about having a child?

530
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:10,541
Madam, I've checked the entire register.

531
00:36:10,625 --> 00:36:12,208
There's no one from Munawwarpur.

532
00:36:12,291 --> 00:36:14,000
You know what?

533
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:18,333
There's Mary Welfare Society in Darbhanga

534
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,541
and Umeed Gruh in Motihari.

535
00:36:22,625 --> 00:36:24,083
{\an8}O, Lord.

536
00:36:24,166 --> 00:36:25,291
{\an8}- O, Lord.
- O, Lord.

537
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:27,541
It's your grace...

538
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:29,583
- It's your grace...
- It's your grace...

539
00:36:29,666 --> 00:36:31,375
- And not our capability...
- And not our capability...

540
00:36:31,458 --> 00:36:35,625
Did you ever come across any girl
from the Munawwarpur shelter home?

541
00:36:35,708 --> 00:36:39,375
We had a girl two years ago.

542
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:41,291
She stayed here for a couple of months.

543
00:36:41,375 --> 00:36:43,666
Later, she was transferred to Hajipur.

544
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:44,791
Why?

545
00:36:44,875 --> 00:36:45,875
She was insane.

546
00:36:45,958 --> 00:36:48,166
She would bite the other girls.

547
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,416
How old was she?

548
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,625
Close to 11 or 12 years.

549
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,916
We never had anyone after that.

550
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,791
{\an8}We came all the way from Patna.

551
00:36:54,875 --> 00:36:56,708
{\an8}See my card. We're from the media.

552
00:36:56,791 --> 00:36:58,541
Call your owner. We'll talk to him.

553
00:36:58,625 --> 00:37:01,208
The owner isn't here. How can I call him?

554
00:37:01,291 --> 00:37:04,458
No one's allowed inside
without permission.

555
00:37:04,541 --> 00:37:07,041
Did you get permission
to come into this world?

556
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:08,041
I didn't, so what?

557
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:10,041
You're irritating me early in the morning.

558
00:37:10,541 --> 00:37:12,541
How dare you talk like that?
Show some respect.

559
00:37:12,625 --> 00:37:13,750
Idiot!

560
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:15,083
Shut up.

561
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:16,291
- You're an idiot.
- Get lost.

562
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:18,791
Madam, let's leave all of this.

563
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:20,583
Let's give this news
to some bigger channel.

564
00:37:20,666 --> 00:37:22,916
When it becomes national news,
the government will deal with it.

565
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,541
At least we'll get a break.
We don't have to talk to such idiots.

566
00:37:37,291 --> 00:37:39,833
Not a single girl from Munawwarpur.

567
00:37:41,291 --> 00:37:43,333
We had two girls a year ago.

568
00:37:43,416 --> 00:37:45,083
But we had sent them to Motihari.

569
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:47,250
The Motihari person said
they haven't had any new girls.

570
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:49,166
Maybe they sent her someplace else.

571
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,333
No idea.

572
00:37:59,041 --> 00:38:02,625
One thing is confirmed.
There is no one here.

573
00:38:03,625 --> 00:38:06,875
There is a girl who cooks for us.

574
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:11,125
She used to cook at the Munawwarpur
girls' shelter home earlier.

575
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:13,625
Do you want to speak to her?

576
00:38:14,416 --> 00:38:15,666
Yes, please.

577
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:17,666
Guddan.

578
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,375
Yes, ma'am.

579
00:38:19,958 --> 00:38:21,750
Call Sudha.

580
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,625
Sudha!

581
00:38:26,166 --> 00:38:28,250
Ma'am is calling you.

582
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:29,750
Coming!

583
00:38:36,666 --> 00:38:37,875
Come, my child.

584
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,916
Come on, don't be scared.

585
00:38:44,375 --> 00:38:46,750
She is Sudha. That's Vaishali.

586
00:38:47,833 --> 00:38:51,791
She wanted to know something
about the Munawwarpur girls' shelter home.

587
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:54,083
Talk to her.

588
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:57,166
Madam, can we please get some tea?

589
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,500
Of course. I'll send some right away.

590
00:39:01,125 --> 00:39:02,333
Relax.

591
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:07,083
She was kneading dough to make bread.

592
00:39:08,291 --> 00:39:10,458
- Why are you standing?
- Wait.

593
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:16,250
Have a seat, dear.

594
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,500
Sudha, I am Vaishali Singh,

595
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
and that's Mr. Bhaskar Sinha.

596
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:36,500
We're from Patna.

597
00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:40,458
We work for the media.

598
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:47,541
Ms. Shobha was telling us

599
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:52,000
you've worked at the Munawwarpur
girls' shelter home before this.

600
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:58,541
If you remember anything,
if you can tell us anything...

601
00:39:58,625 --> 00:40:00,000
I don't know anything.

602
00:40:02,875 --> 00:40:04,875
Anything, good or bad. Anything at all.

603
00:40:10,166 --> 00:40:14,625
Sudha, I've heard
that girls are being abused over there.

604
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:17,416
Did you see anything?

605
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,416
No. I don't know anything.

606
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:25,291
What will be the outcome
if you don't tell us what you know?

607
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:27,500
You'll be a part of this crime in the end.

608
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:31,875
Say something.

609
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,416
Sudha, I'm only trying
to help those girls.

610
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:55,875
You must remember something.

611
00:41:03,166 --> 00:41:05,625
I can't force you to speak to me.

612
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:10,500
I've left my number with Ms. Shobha.

613
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,125
In case you remember anything at all,
give me a call.

614
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:15,875
Okay?

615
00:41:36,875 --> 00:41:39,875
She was speaking
in the interest of those girls.

616
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:41,166
Think about it.

617
00:41:48,416 --> 00:41:49,500
Wait.

618
00:41:52,541 --> 00:41:54,166
If I tell you anything,

619
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,625
will my identity remain a secret?

620
00:42:01,041 --> 00:42:04,541
I swear
I'll never let your name be revealed.

621
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:05,791
Have faith in me.

622
00:42:11,083 --> 00:42:12,541
- Can I record--
- Please don't do that.

623
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:18,291
Whenever you're ready.

624
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:31,958
<i>December 2016 was the first time
I went to the girls' shelter home.</i>

625
00:42:32,041 --> 00:42:34,416
<i>My dad got me a job over there.</i>

626
00:42:35,458 --> 00:42:38,625
<i>He said Bansi Sahu is a very nice man.</i>

627
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:40,791
<i>And I could learn a lot under him.</i>

628
00:42:40,875 --> 00:42:42,541
Fine, I'll send four.

629
00:42:42,625 --> 00:42:45,208
<i>There, I met Sonu first.</i>

630
00:42:45,291 --> 00:42:46,541
Sudha...

631
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,375
- Your age?
- I'm 21.

632
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:51,083
You're 21?

633
00:42:51,166 --> 00:42:53,583
- <i>Sonu was the caretaker of the place.</i>
- Here.

634
00:42:53,666 --> 00:42:56,875
Press harder.

635
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,333
Yes.

636
00:43:00,916 --> 00:43:02,416
Baby, where are you?

637
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,375
Come downstairs.

638
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:10,375
<i>After meeting Sonu, he sent me inside.</i>

639
00:43:20,958 --> 00:43:23,541
<i>That was when I first met Baby Rani.</i>

640
00:43:24,708 --> 00:43:27,458
<i>Baby Rani was the warden
of the shelter home.</i>

641
00:43:28,166 --> 00:43:30,541
<i>She looked quite ordinary.</i>

642
00:43:30,625 --> 00:43:33,458
<i>But she was nothing the way she looked.</i>

643
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:37,666
What is your name?

644
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:38,750
Sudha.

645
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,875
Sudha...

646
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,333
What does Sudha mean?

647
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Nectar.

648
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:49,750
Nectar.

649
00:43:51,125 --> 00:43:52,875
You've been appointed as the cook.

650
00:43:53,541 --> 00:43:54,875
So stick to cooking.

651
00:43:55,500 --> 00:44:01,666
You have no business
with who or what anyone's up to.

652
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:02,791
Okay?

653
00:44:02,875 --> 00:44:04,541
- <i>At first, I didn't understand</i>
- Come.

654
00:44:04,625 --> 00:44:06,375
<i>what Baby Rani had said.</i>

655
00:44:06,458 --> 00:44:07,750
Come.

656
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:14,083
{\an8}<i>I went into the girls' room
with Baby Rani.</i>

657
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:24,666
Leave it.

658
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:25,791
What, leave it?

659
00:44:25,875 --> 00:44:26,875
Give it back to her.

660
00:44:26,958 --> 00:44:28,791
Why are you fighting?

661
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:29,916
Sit down!

662
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,625
Or else, you'll get a tight slap.

663
00:44:31,708 --> 00:44:35,416
<i>There were no rooms, just one large hall.</i>

664
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,833
<i>There were mattresses
spread out on the floor.</i>

665
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:40,375
<i>There wasn't even a single window.</i>

666
00:44:40,916 --> 00:44:45,000
<i>Around 40 to 45 girls of the shelter home
were seated on the floor.</i>

667
00:44:45,708 --> 00:44:46,750
Look here.

668
00:44:50,625 --> 00:44:51,958
She is Sudha.

669
00:44:52,541 --> 00:44:55,375
Starting today,
she will cook for all of you.

670
00:45:02,291 --> 00:45:06,041
Some of these girls are insane.

671
00:45:06,125 --> 00:45:07,583
They bite.

672
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:10,125
If anyone tries to bite you,

673
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:11,833
then give a tight slap.

674
00:45:12,791 --> 00:45:13,750
Come on, let's go.

675
00:45:37,541 --> 00:45:38,500
Listen, girl...

676
00:45:42,166 --> 00:45:43,583
Don't bite me or I will hit you.

677
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:50,166
I am not insane to bite you.

678
00:45:51,625 --> 00:45:52,625
I just came to tell you

679
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,875
that you should run away
as soon as you can.

680
00:45:55,375 --> 00:45:56,416
They are not nice people.

681
00:45:57,291 --> 00:45:59,875
- Why are you trying to scare me?
- I am telling the truth.

682
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:02,250
What are you gossiping about?

683
00:46:03,125 --> 00:46:04,208
I was hungry,

684
00:46:04,291 --> 00:46:05,833
so I came to ask if the food was ready.

685
00:46:06,416 --> 00:46:07,708
Is it time yet, princess?

686
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:12,291
How many times have I told you
not to enter the kitchen?

687
00:46:12,375 --> 00:46:13,250
Get lost!

688
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:20,375
They are rude. Don't talk to them.

689
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,875
Talk to me as much as you like.

690
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:47,416
Motherfucker! You guys make a mess
and disrupt my sleep!

691
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,916
Now you're trying to run away?

692
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,791
I wasn't running away, sir.

693
00:46:50,875 --> 00:46:52,916
She's heavy. Please help.

694
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,541
What heavy, asshole? I'll break your head!

695
00:46:55,625 --> 00:46:57,166
Pick it up!

696
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:59,416
He's telling me she's heavy.

697
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,541
Asshole!

698
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:03,541
And you, bring her along!

699
00:47:04,125 --> 00:47:06,458
You'll understand
when I kick your ass in the morning.

700
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:08,625
Come on.

701
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:17,916
<i>Dom</i>, it's Sonu speaking.

702
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I'm bringing a girl over. Stay awake.

703
00:47:21,875 --> 00:47:23,250
Yes, we'll be there soon.

704
00:47:24,125 --> 00:47:25,375
Come on.

705
00:47:44,875 --> 00:47:45,791
Haul her in quick.

706
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,875
It's the same drama every day.

707
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:22,416
I'm tired of explaining.

708
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,625
But nothing gets in your thick head!

709
00:48:25,583 --> 00:48:28,666
I'll show you tomorrow
when you wake up, bitch.

710
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:32,125
You'll realize when I keep you
locked up in the dark room for three days.

711
00:48:32,625 --> 00:48:34,875
You will neither get food nor water.

712
00:48:34,958 --> 00:48:36,875
Just rot in there!

713
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,416
Have you lost your mind?

714
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,250
How can you be so stupid?

715
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:24,625
Will you understand
when they strip you naked?

716
00:50:25,875 --> 00:50:27,166
And if you don't comply,

717
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:31,375
they will bury you alive
without any trace.

718
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,250
{\an8}Look.

719
00:50:36,083 --> 00:50:38,875
Look.

720
00:50:41,625 --> 00:50:42,625
Do you want to see more?

721
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,000
They took me yesterday.

722
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:49,041
{\an8}When I yelled and screamed,

723
00:50:49,125 --> 00:50:51,250
{\an8}they beat me up and left me here.

724
00:50:51,875 --> 00:50:53,916
They took two more girls today.

725
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,625
Tomorrow, it will be your turn.

726
00:50:56,875 --> 00:50:58,166
So listen to me

727
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:01,416
and get out of here while you still can.

728
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,500
Otherwise, you won't be able to leave.

729
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Understood?

730
00:51:07,375 --> 00:51:10,166
And if you didn't, then you don't have to.

731
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:12,125
Just save yourself and run away.

732
00:51:18,125 --> 00:51:20,416
Go out after five minutes.

733
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:21,750
Lock the door.

734
00:52:04,291 --> 00:52:05,666
That bloody Neeraj!

735
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:08,416
I wonder what he did with that girl
after watching that porn flick.

736
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,916
She has been screaming for five days.

737
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,791
I've locked her up in the room.

738
00:52:11,875 --> 00:52:14,291
- I wonder what she will do if I go in.
- You're such a coward.

739
00:52:14,375 --> 00:52:15,666
Strangle her to death.

740
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:17,000
And then?

741
00:52:17,625 --> 00:52:18,875
Then what?

742
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:20,875
Who is she?

743
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:23,500
Is her name mentioned in the register?

744
00:52:24,125 --> 00:52:25,541
Does CWC know about her?

745
00:52:25,625 --> 00:52:27,500
No one knows whether she exists or not.

746
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:32,250
I'm fasting today.
Otherwise, I would've killed her myself.

747
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:37,375
You know what?

748
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:42,375
Remember that thin, dark-skinned girl
we brought from Samastipur?

749
00:52:44,125 --> 00:52:47,250
Tell her to strangle that girl
and we'll set her free.

750
00:52:47,875 --> 00:52:48,875
We will let her go?

751
00:52:51,125 --> 00:52:53,166
I am just joking, you fool.

752
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:54,875
- Do you think I'll let her go?
- Goodness!

753
00:52:54,958 --> 00:52:57,250
It's hard to tell when you're joking
and when you're serious.

754
00:53:05,375 --> 00:53:06,375
Who are you?

755
00:53:07,416 --> 00:53:08,500
I...

756
00:53:09,375 --> 00:53:10,666
She is Sudha.

757
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:13,250
She is the new cook here.

758
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:14,875
Sudha.

759
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:17,625
Sudha. Nice.

760
00:53:19,875 --> 00:53:21,500
What do you cook?

761
00:53:23,875 --> 00:53:25,000
Never mind her, sir.

762
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,041
She's going to be around.

763
00:53:27,125 --> 00:53:28,541
You can check her out later.

764
00:53:29,125 --> 00:53:31,833
{\an8}Mr. Sinha has been sleeping here
since last night.

765
00:53:31,916 --> 00:53:33,250
Take a look at him.

766
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,166
That bloody Mithilesh...

767
00:53:37,875 --> 00:53:39,750
Kick him in the ass.

768
00:53:41,375 --> 00:53:42,625
Nice.

769
00:53:44,333 --> 00:53:45,625
Your hair is all wet.

770
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,666
You'll catch a cold.

771
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:49,875
Take care.

772
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:54,375
Don't you carry a veil?

773
00:53:55,625 --> 00:53:58,500
Drink some hot tea.
And get one cup for me as well.

774
00:54:04,625 --> 00:54:06,291
That's Mr. Bansi.

775
00:54:06,375 --> 00:54:08,958
The master, owner, he's everything.

776
00:54:09,041 --> 00:54:10,791
If you keep him happy,

777
00:54:10,875 --> 00:54:12,125
you'll be happy.

778
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:16,583
Go. Make some tea.

779
00:54:28,875 --> 00:54:31,250
Doctor, what are you thinking?

780
00:54:31,333 --> 00:54:35,125
This master has made things tough for me.

781
00:54:36,416 --> 00:54:39,083
The injury is pretty serious.

782
00:54:39,166 --> 00:54:40,625
Please tell that Baby,

783
00:54:40,708 --> 00:54:44,208
girls are for satisfying your desires,

784
00:54:44,291 --> 00:54:46,166
not for putting out cigarettes.

785
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:49,125
She could've bought an ashtray instead.

786
00:54:49,208 --> 00:54:51,625
Why waste something that's worth millions?

787
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,958
Ask him.

788
00:54:57,041 --> 00:55:01,791
Do cigarettes cause injuries,
wounds, or burn marks?

789
00:55:01,875 --> 00:55:04,416
Master, it's injury.

790
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,250
It burns.

791
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:09,291
It burns.

792
00:55:09,375 --> 00:55:10,875
You're unbelievable.

793
00:55:12,958 --> 00:55:14,041
What medicine did you give her?

794
00:56:56,625 --> 00:56:59,166
They just don't get it.

795
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:01,958
That Pappu Thekedar
took Gudiya to the hotel.

796
00:57:02,041 --> 00:57:03,583
When Gudiya started screaming,

797
00:57:03,666 --> 00:57:05,041
he shoved chili powder up hers.

798
00:57:05,125 --> 00:57:06,583
That motherfucker...

799
00:57:06,666 --> 00:57:08,458
Doctor is completely drunk.
You handle it now.

800
00:57:08,541 --> 00:57:09,708
What should I do?

801
00:57:09,791 --> 00:57:10,708
Take a look.

802
00:57:10,791 --> 00:57:12,208
Save her if you can.

803
00:57:12,291 --> 00:57:13,708
Otherwise, just choke her to death.

804
00:57:13,791 --> 00:57:16,000
- And Mr. Bansi?
- I will deal with him. Go.

805
00:57:37,666 --> 00:57:40,166
<i>Had I not escaped that night,</i>

806
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,500
<i>maybe I'd never get another chance.</i>

807
00:57:43,583 --> 00:57:46,208
GIRLS' SHELTER HOME, MUNAWWARPUR

808
00:58:06,125 --> 00:58:09,166
At least Sudha should have spoken up
and taken a stand.

809
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:11,250
Why hasn't she? It's wrong.

810
00:58:11,333 --> 00:58:13,291
It's not Sudha's fault.

811
00:58:17,125 --> 00:58:18,958
Our society has made

812
00:58:21,083 --> 00:58:23,083
girls like her helpless.

813
00:58:25,916 --> 00:58:27,958
She can't speak up,

814
00:58:29,666 --> 00:58:31,291
but we can.

815
00:58:31,375 --> 00:58:34,000
What will you say and to whom?

816
00:58:34,083 --> 00:58:36,083
They'll ask on what grounds
we made these claims.

817
00:58:36,166 --> 00:58:38,375
What are you going to say?
We have nothing to show.

818
00:58:44,375 --> 00:58:47,250
There is a difference
between humans and animals.

819
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:53,750
Humans can use their minds and speak up.

820
00:58:56,625 --> 00:58:58,750
If we cannot do that,

821
00:59:01,375 --> 00:59:04,083
then we should consider ourselves animals.

822
00:59:09,375 --> 00:59:11,750
We must use every ounce
of our strength, Mr. Bhaskar.

823
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,375
To get those girls justice.

824
00:59:33,791 --> 00:59:35,125
Let's go.

825
00:59:36,541 --> 00:59:42,083
<i>O' River Ganga, you've witnessed
Everything on your shores</i>

826
00:59:42,166 --> 00:59:47,458
<i>O' Ganga, you've witnessed
Everything on your shores</i>

827
00:59:47,541 --> 00:59:48,875
Let's go.

828
00:59:48,958 --> 00:59:50,541
<i>Haven't you frozen?</i>

829
00:59:50,625 --> 00:59:51,791
You're absolutely right.

830
00:59:51,875 --> 00:59:54,666
<i>How could you still flow</i>

831
00:59:54,750 --> 01:00:00,666
<i>Slowly</i>

832
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:06,625
<i>O' Ganga</i>

833
01:00:06,708 --> 01:00:13,041
<i>O' Ganga, you've witnessed
Everything on your shores</i>

834
01:00:13,125 --> 01:00:19,791
<i>O' Ganga, you've witnessed
Everything on your shores</i>

835
01:00:36,916 --> 01:00:38,458
Why don't you talk to her?

836
01:00:38,541 --> 01:00:40,333
That Bansi Sahu is not a good guy.

837
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:45,083
And the way Vaishali
has been pursuing him to run her news

838
01:00:45,833 --> 01:00:47,250
could prove her wrong.

839
01:00:50,083 --> 01:00:52,041
I know. I've spoken to Vaishali about it.

840
01:00:52,125 --> 01:00:54,750
I know what you've been telling her.

841
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:59,916
If I knew you would change
so drastically after marriage,

842
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,208
I would've never let you marry this girl.

843
01:01:02,833 --> 01:01:03,708
Bring some fritters.

844
01:01:04,958 --> 01:01:07,833
Your dad had asked me
before consenting to this relationship.

845
01:01:08,333 --> 01:01:11,208
{\an8}It's too late anyway.
What's the point now?

846
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:14,500
- No point in crying over--
- Hello, my sister-in-law.

847
01:01:15,625 --> 01:01:17,000
God bless you.

848
01:01:18,333 --> 01:01:19,333
Greetings, my brother-in-law.

849
01:01:20,833 --> 01:01:22,250
Where are you coming from?

850
01:01:23,625 --> 01:01:25,375
I was on a tour of Bihar.

851
01:01:26,125 --> 01:01:28,375
Looking for Bansi Sahu's playground.

852
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:32,291
You're still fixated on that, aren't you?

853
01:01:32,375 --> 01:01:34,541
I am, my brother-in-law.

854
01:01:34,625 --> 01:01:38,291
And I will only move on
once Bansi Sahu gets capital punishment.

855
01:01:38,375 --> 01:01:41,041
It's not right
to be so fixated on something.

856
01:01:42,375 --> 01:01:44,916
If I was fixated on everything,

857
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,041
then we wouldn't be sharing a snack today.

858
01:01:48,625 --> 01:01:51,625
{\an8}I would've been
a national-level reporter, wouldn't I?

859
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:54,625
Be thankful for what you have.

860
01:01:54,708 --> 01:01:57,416
Don't be a sour lemon.

861
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,291
If you're so hung up on right and wrong,

862
01:01:59,375 --> 01:02:01,500
then don't just show
what a reporter can do.

863
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,500
Go to the court and file a case.

864
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:07,166
There's a system in place for everything.

865
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:09,250
How does news reporting fit into all this?

866
01:02:09,916 --> 01:02:12,208
And you call yourself a journalist.

867
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:19,125
My brother-in-law, that reminds me.

868
01:02:19,208 --> 01:02:23,500
To file a case,
I'll need a lawyer, won't I?

869
01:02:23,583 --> 01:02:25,250
And you are a lawyer.

870
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:30,833
How long will you keep
making birth certificates?

871
01:02:32,291 --> 01:02:34,833
I want to file a PIL. Will you do it?

872
01:02:41,625 --> 01:02:46,000
I mean, donning the black coat alone
doesn't make you a lawyer.

873
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:52,375
Please say yes only if you genuinely
want to help, my brother-in-law.

874
01:02:53,583 --> 01:02:59,333
Dozens of lawyers stand outside the court.
I'll find someone else.

875
01:03:11,541 --> 01:03:13,625
What are you looking at?
Eat those fritters!

876
01:03:28,416 --> 01:03:30,250
GIRLS' SHELTER HOME, MUNAWWARPUR

877
01:03:30,333 --> 01:03:31,625
No, mister.

878
01:03:31,708 --> 01:03:33,833
You dance well to the songs,

879
01:03:33,916 --> 01:03:35,541
but always miss the words.

880
01:03:35,625 --> 01:03:38,416
It's not "Whack! Whack!",
it's "Smack! Smack!"

881
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:45,333
What is this?

882
01:03:46,083 --> 01:03:47,041
PIL.

883
01:03:47,125 --> 01:03:48,583
PIL for what?

884
01:03:48,666 --> 01:03:50,541
Someone has filed a PIL
in Patna High Court.

885
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:54,000
PIL for what?

886
01:03:54,083 --> 01:03:55,375
It's against the state government.

887
01:03:56,208 --> 01:03:58,875
It's about why they aren't taking any
action against our girls' shelter home!

888
01:04:15,708 --> 01:04:17,333
Who the fuck has filed this?

889
01:04:18,166 --> 01:04:19,375
I am trying to find out.

890
01:04:20,458 --> 01:04:21,833
Still trying to find out?

891
01:04:22,583 --> 01:04:23,958
What were you doing until now?

892
01:04:28,208 --> 01:04:29,583
What do you think, master?

893
01:04:35,708 --> 01:04:36,708
Sir...

894
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:40,625
Only someone who knows about the report

895
01:04:40,708 --> 01:04:43,666
and wants the case to be reopened
will file a PIL.

896
01:04:45,708 --> 01:04:48,833
That reporter. What was her name?

897
01:04:49,458 --> 01:04:51,000
Vaishali.

898
01:04:51,083 --> 01:04:52,625
But there is no name on it.

899
01:04:52,708 --> 01:04:54,000
It was filed anonymously.

900
01:04:54,083 --> 01:04:55,625
Remember Brij Bihari's case?

901
01:04:55,708 --> 01:04:58,500
- Yes.
- First, the PIL was filed.

902
01:04:58,583 --> 01:05:00,291
He took it lightly and later got screwed.

903
01:05:00,375 --> 01:05:02,500
The same thing happened
with Chandrashekhar, right?

904
01:05:02,583 --> 01:05:03,875
That was a murder case.

905
01:05:03,958 --> 01:05:06,125
302 is different and a PIL is different.

906
01:05:07,125 --> 01:05:08,958
- You see, a PIL is--
- Shut up.

907
01:05:09,041 --> 01:05:10,000
Don't be a wise guy.

908
01:05:10,083 --> 01:05:11,791
If you know so much,
why didn't you become a lawyer?

909
01:05:13,833 --> 01:05:14,708
Dial Patna.

910
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:17,208
And tell Brijmohan I want to meet.

911
01:05:41,041 --> 01:05:42,583
I said I'll deal with it.

912
01:05:43,583 --> 01:05:47,041
Listen, I'll call you back sometime.

913
01:05:47,125 --> 01:05:48,000
Okay.

914
01:05:48,083 --> 01:05:49,083
Now hang up.

915
01:05:52,458 --> 01:05:53,500
What's the matter, Bansi?

916
01:05:53,583 --> 01:05:54,916
Why are you so stressed?

917
01:05:56,583 --> 01:05:58,208
Don't worry, Mr. Singh.

918
01:05:59,083 --> 01:06:00,625
I won't be stressed alone.

919
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:03,083
I know.

920
01:06:03,583 --> 01:06:07,291
Don't fret over these little things.

921
01:06:07,375 --> 01:06:10,250
Find a bigger topic for the election.

922
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:12,041
Does this look like a little thing to you?

923
01:06:12,958 --> 01:06:14,208
Well?

924
01:06:14,291 --> 01:06:15,500
Remember what you said?

925
01:06:15,583 --> 01:06:17,583
"Don't worry,
the media will never find out.

926
01:06:17,666 --> 01:06:19,083
Even if they do, I'll manage them."

927
01:06:19,166 --> 01:06:20,375
Now, someone has filed a PIL!

928
01:06:20,458 --> 01:06:21,458
Did you manage this?

929
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:30,000
Don't just stand there.
Get something for him.

930
01:06:30,083 --> 01:06:31,125
Are you an approver?

931
01:06:31,208 --> 01:06:32,583
- No, I'll get something.
- Go!

932
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:37,458
I am managing it.

933
01:06:38,083 --> 01:06:39,833
Did any big players come in?

934
01:06:40,458 --> 01:06:42,250
And there won't be anyone
in the future as well.

935
01:06:42,333 --> 01:06:45,416
This Vaishali is no big deal.

936
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:47,500
No one in the media even knows about her.

937
01:06:47,583 --> 01:06:49,458
It's not about known or unknown,
Mr. Singh.

938
01:06:50,416 --> 01:06:54,583
We must stop her,
no matter how insignificant she is.

939
01:06:55,208 --> 01:06:57,833
What if they become significant tomorrow?

940
01:06:57,916 --> 01:06:59,000
Then what?

941
01:07:01,208 --> 01:07:02,875
Did anyone tell you to interfere?

942
01:07:02,958 --> 01:07:04,083
I am talking to him.

943
01:07:04,166 --> 01:07:05,916
- I am just--
- If he doesn't stop barking,

944
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,375
someday he will get you in trouble.

945
01:07:07,958 --> 01:07:08,833
What did you say?

946
01:07:10,708 --> 01:07:12,875
I am barking?

947
01:07:12,958 --> 01:07:15,666
You mean, I am a dog?

948
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:19,416
Yes, I am barking because I am loyal.

949
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:20,541
What do you have to say?

950
01:07:20,625 --> 01:07:24,583
Dogs like him will get you in trouble.

951
01:07:24,666 --> 01:07:27,666
She can do nothing. Nothing!

952
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:29,500
You know what, Mr. Singh?

953
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,416
You are responsible
for a couple of things,

954
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:36,625
but it doesn't mean I'll watch silently
when someone throws shit on my face.

955
01:07:39,625 --> 01:07:41,625
If you don't stop her, then I will.

956
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:43,166
I won't hold back.

957
01:07:43,250 --> 01:07:45,708
Hey! Don't talk rubbish.

958
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:49,041
Don't lay a finger on her.

959
01:07:49,125 --> 01:07:50,375
Not a finger.

960
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,375
Orders are from above.

961
01:07:53,375 --> 01:07:56,041
She's a reporter and a woman too.

962
01:07:56,125 --> 01:07:57,916
If you even put a scratch on her,

963
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,791
all of the media fraternity
will come after us.

964
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:01,583
Who will be accountable then?

965
01:08:01,666 --> 01:08:02,583
Who?

966
01:08:03,791 --> 01:08:05,791
I've put the entire state government
on your security

967
01:08:05,875 --> 01:08:07,291
and you're worried sick.

968
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:09,416
I am quiet because she is a reporter.

969
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:12,666
Otherwise, I would've beheaded her
and thrown her body on the railway tracks!

970
01:08:14,375 --> 01:08:15,833
Nonsense.

971
01:08:16,583 --> 01:08:20,416
And the state government is saving itself,
not me. Even you know that.

972
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:23,625
Don't make me lose my temper
for your own good.

973
01:08:24,375 --> 01:08:25,458
Understood?

974
01:08:27,083 --> 01:08:28,458
You're a smart man yourself.

975
01:08:29,833 --> 01:08:31,083
He only looks like one.

976
01:08:31,583 --> 01:08:34,000
These things
won't make a difference, Mr. Bhaskar.

977
01:08:37,458 --> 01:08:40,000
Our channel isn't reaching many people.

978
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,916
And until our channel
doesn't have a wide reach,

979
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,583
how will they see our news?

980
01:08:45,583 --> 01:08:48,000
Suggest something.
What should we do? Tell me.

981
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:50,500
We'll have to go viral, Bhaskar.

982
01:08:51,208 --> 01:08:52,083
What does that mean?

983
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,083
Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter.

984
01:08:56,625 --> 01:08:58,625
We'll try everything
we can get our hands on.

985
01:08:59,250 --> 01:09:00,625
Something will definitely work out.

986
01:09:00,708 --> 01:09:03,375
These are a few things
I know nothing about.

987
01:09:05,125 --> 01:09:09,791
Madam, Ajit's always on the phone at home.

988
01:09:10,375 --> 01:09:11,416
I'll call him over.

989
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:13,541
Let him look after this. What do you say?

990
01:09:13,625 --> 01:09:14,750
Yes.

991
01:09:16,083 --> 01:09:20,208
Mr. Bhaskar, starting tomorrow,
we'll do a 30-minute show every day.

992
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:23,750
I'll do live reporting
on the Munawwarpur case.

993
01:09:24,458 --> 01:09:25,666
I'll speak about everything.

994
01:09:25,750 --> 01:09:28,416
NISS report, Bansi Sahu,

995
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:31,125
why the government isn't taking action.
We'll disclose everything.

996
01:09:31,916 --> 01:09:32,750
Okay.

997
01:09:32,833 --> 01:09:34,500
Great. Absolutely correct.

998
01:09:35,875 --> 01:09:37,000
Nice.

999
01:09:49,041 --> 01:09:50,666
<i>I've picked you from the streets.</i>

1000
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:51,625
<i>How can you forget?</i>

1001
01:09:53,458 --> 01:09:55,625
I gave you a roof, food and clothes.

1002
01:09:55,708 --> 01:09:57,250
Does all this come for free?

1003
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Do you know what orphan means?

1004
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:09,625
Someone who has been abandoned.

1005
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,458
No one to look up to.

1006
01:10:13,708 --> 01:10:17,875
No one knows whether you exist or not.

1007
01:10:20,208 --> 01:10:21,500
Only I do.

1008
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:24,000
I am your master.

1009
01:10:26,708 --> 01:10:28,958
You'll do as I say.

1010
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:32,875
Or else, I'll stub you with this cigarette
until you're dead.

1011
01:10:35,125 --> 01:10:36,083
Will you do it?

1012
01:10:36,625 --> 01:10:37,750
Will you do it?

1013
01:10:43,583 --> 01:10:44,625
What's the matter?

1014
01:10:46,625 --> 01:10:50,250
I can't find the guy who filed the PIL.

1015
01:10:52,625 --> 01:10:55,291
I gave you a small job.

1016
01:10:55,375 --> 01:10:56,708
Don't you get it?

1017
01:10:57,958 --> 01:10:59,291
I suspect a guy.

1018
01:10:59,875 --> 01:11:01,708
{\an8}He's Vaishali's brother-in-law.
Suresh Singh.

1019
01:11:02,208 --> 01:11:04,958
He's a bloody lawyer.
I think he's involved in all this.

1020
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:07,625
He practices in Munawwarpur court.

1021
01:11:08,625 --> 01:11:10,541
He lives in Brahampura with his wife.

1022
01:11:11,125 --> 01:11:13,500
{\an8}I'll go deal with him if you want.

1023
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:20,500
Take your belt out.

1024
01:11:31,125 --> 01:11:33,833
Let me go!

1025
01:11:34,708 --> 01:11:37,166
What are you looking up for?
Do you want to go?

1026
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,583
Forgive me.

1027
01:11:57,125 --> 01:11:58,250
Understood?

1028
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:18,333
My sister-in-law!

1029
01:12:19,833 --> 01:12:20,833
Is he all right?

1030
01:12:24,583 --> 01:12:26,250
What are you here for now?

1031
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,500
You've already done what you wanted.

1032
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:32,041
What are you saying, my sister-in-law?

1033
01:12:32,125 --> 01:12:33,458
He was badly beaten up.

1034
01:12:34,375 --> 01:12:35,750
He has serious head injuries.

1035
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:37,875
He lost a lot of blood.

1036
01:12:37,958 --> 01:12:40,125
The doctor has taken him inside,
he's bandaging him up.

1037
01:12:41,875 --> 01:12:43,375
You must know already.

1038
01:12:43,458 --> 01:12:45,333
They were Bansi Sahu's men.

1039
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:49,208
The police didn't even file an FIR.

1040
01:12:51,458 --> 01:12:52,500
Are you happy now?

1041
01:12:53,083 --> 01:12:54,375
No, my sister-in-law...

1042
01:13:08,208 --> 01:13:09,541
Who attacked your brother-in-law?

1043
01:13:09,625 --> 01:13:10,791
Bansi Sahu.

1044
01:13:11,375 --> 01:13:12,500
Bansi Sahu?

1045
01:13:12,583 --> 01:13:14,166
He lives on Sahu Road.

1046
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:15,666
The reporter?

1047
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:17,375
He's not a reporter.

1048
01:13:18,958 --> 01:13:21,500
Have you ever met him?

1049
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:23,916
How does that matter?

1050
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,416
It doesn't matter,

1051
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:28,291
but you should know the man
you're filing a complaint against.

1052
01:13:28,375 --> 01:13:30,250
As far as I know,

1053
01:13:30,750 --> 01:13:34,416
it's hard to find a man like him.

1054
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:37,708
- He's such a decent--
- I run a news channel.

1055
01:13:38,375 --> 01:13:41,333
Bansi Sahu has been in the headlines.

1056
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:43,875
He warned me, threatened me.

1057
01:13:43,958 --> 01:13:46,000
- But you see--
- Wait a second, madam?

1058
01:13:46,541 --> 01:13:48,291
Did he warn you or threaten you?

1059
01:13:48,375 --> 01:13:49,708
What's your question?

1060
01:13:49,791 --> 01:13:51,875
A warning is like a request

1061
01:13:51,958 --> 01:13:55,250
not to broadcast anything
against him on TV.

1062
01:13:55,833 --> 01:13:58,791
And threat means that
her life's in danger.

1063
01:13:58,875 --> 01:14:00,875
Bravo, Dheeraj! You are pretty smart.

1064
01:14:00,958 --> 01:14:03,041
This is a serious matter, sir.

1065
01:14:03,125 --> 01:14:05,208
You're treating it too lightly.
Take my complaint.

1066
01:14:05,291 --> 01:14:11,208
Well, madam, I don't know why Mr. Bansi
has been in the headlines on your channel.

1067
01:14:11,291 --> 01:14:12,958
But I have a question.

1068
01:14:13,041 --> 01:14:15,000
If he was snuffed with you,

1069
01:14:15,625 --> 01:14:18,958
then why did he beat up
your brother-in-law and not you?

1070
01:14:19,625 --> 01:14:21,208
How can you talk to me like this?

1071
01:14:21,291 --> 01:14:22,875
My family has been attacked.

1072
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:25,375
I'm here to file a complaint.
Take my complaint.

1073
01:14:25,458 --> 01:14:27,625
Since you're a woman
and a reporter at that,

1074
01:14:27,708 --> 01:14:30,666
I'll file a complaint
of violence for your sake.

1075
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:31,875
Take it down, Dheeraj.

1076
01:14:31,958 --> 01:14:33,291
But I won't write anyone's name.

1077
01:14:33,375 --> 01:14:34,625
Why wouldn't you?

1078
01:14:34,708 --> 01:14:36,958
What do you mean?

1079
01:14:37,041 --> 01:14:41,666
Someone will walk right in
and file a complaint against any guy,

1080
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:43,000
and I'll accept it?

1081
01:14:43,083 --> 01:14:46,166
The law has a system, madam.

1082
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:47,333
I get it, sir.

1083
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:48,791
Thank you.

1084
01:14:48,875 --> 01:14:51,583
What has gotten into her?

1085
01:14:52,166 --> 01:14:53,708
It's bad enough they beat me up,

1086
01:14:54,333 --> 01:14:56,250
but they also badgered my motorcycle.

1087
01:14:57,208 --> 01:14:59,500
Your dad had gifted me.

1088
01:15:00,166 --> 01:15:01,625
Aunt is here.

1089
01:15:02,958 --> 01:15:04,500
Here comes the princess.

1090
01:15:06,458 --> 01:15:08,875
You're pretty seriously injured,
my brother-in-law.

1091
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,875
Why didn't you tell me?

1092
01:15:15,375 --> 01:15:17,875
- If you were filing the PIL--
- PIL?

1093
01:15:18,958 --> 01:15:21,041
I am not crazy to file the PIL.

1094
01:15:21,125 --> 01:15:23,458
I haven't filed any PIL.

1095
01:15:23,541 --> 01:15:24,916
PIL, my foot!

1096
01:15:29,875 --> 01:15:34,791
If you didn't file the PIL,
then why did Bansi Sahu's men--

1097
01:15:34,875 --> 01:15:37,750
Bansi Sahu's man, Sonu, came to badger me.

1098
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:40,083
He beat me up outside the court.

1099
01:15:40,166 --> 01:15:41,666
He told me to get this through to you

1100
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:43,541
or else,
you'll face the same consequences.

1101
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:45,541
What did you think?

1102
01:15:45,625 --> 01:15:47,916
You will change the society?
Change the system?

1103
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:49,875
You're trying to be a hero!

1104
01:15:54,875 --> 01:15:57,291
I didn't know this would happen,
my brother-in-law.

1105
01:15:57,375 --> 01:16:00,958
If you pinch their nerves,
they won't let it go.

1106
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:03,791
You think I'm an asshole
because I don't say anything.

1107
01:16:03,875 --> 01:16:05,583
- No--
- You think I'm an asshole.

1108
01:16:06,416 --> 01:16:09,500
- No, don't say that.
- Do you know why we keep quiet?

1109
01:16:09,583 --> 01:16:11,625
Because we want to stay safe.

1110
01:16:11,708 --> 01:16:12,833
We have a family.

1111
01:16:13,333 --> 01:16:16,500
Today, they just beat me up.
Tomorrow, they can even slit my throat

1112
01:16:16,583 --> 01:16:18,083
and the police won't do a thing.

1113
01:16:18,166 --> 01:16:19,541
I went to file an FIR.

1114
01:16:19,625 --> 01:16:21,875
How can you be that stupid?

1115
01:16:21,958 --> 01:16:23,666
Don't you have brains?

1116
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:25,125
I don't want to get into your mess!

1117
01:16:25,208 --> 01:16:26,875
I told you once! Why don't you get it?

1118
01:16:26,958 --> 01:16:28,166
Get her out of here...

1119
01:16:29,333 --> 01:16:30,541
Stop putting us in trouble...

1120
01:16:49,416 --> 01:16:55,708
<i>There's no hope from anyone</i>

1121
01:16:55,791 --> 01:17:01,041
<i>Even our joy is short-lived</i>

1122
01:17:01,125 --> 01:17:07,125
<i>There's no hope from anyone</i>

1123
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:13,208
<i>Even our joy is short-lived</i>

1124
01:17:13,291 --> 01:17:19,666
<i>Our troubles keep growing
With every moment</i>

1125
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:26,166
<i>My heart longs for
A single ray of hope</i>

1126
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:32,958
<i>Please show us the light
At the end of the tunnel</i>

1127
01:17:35,208 --> 01:17:41,250
<i>- O' Ganga
- How you keep flowing</i>

1128
01:17:41,333 --> 01:17:48,291
<i>- O' Ganga
- Slowly</i>

1129
01:18:04,875 --> 01:18:05,916
Why are you so worried?

1130
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:12,916
What can we do?

1131
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,750
We live in a male-dominated society.

1132
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:18,958
If the wife sets out to do some good
and the husband supports her,

1133
01:18:20,333 --> 01:18:21,500
it is tough to see.

1134
01:18:25,250 --> 01:18:26,375
Forgive me.

1135
01:18:30,625 --> 01:18:31,750
It doesn't matter.

1136
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:33,875
How does it not matter?

1137
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:42,750
And you came from Patna
to Munawwarpur on a scooter.

1138
01:18:43,333 --> 01:18:44,875
You should've taken the car.

1139
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,666
I look better going to the office
on the scooter.

1140
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:53,291
I like the fresh breeze on my face.

1141
01:19:02,458 --> 01:19:05,250
{\an8}Let's go get something to eat.
I am hungry.

1142
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,125
There's nothing I can do about
my brother-in-law's injuries, Arvind.

1143
01:19:25,125 --> 01:19:28,708
But I can put his injuries to better use.

1144
01:19:30,458 --> 01:19:33,375
And maybe he might earn some merits.

1145
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,500
{\an8}I don't understand. What do you mean?

1146
01:19:37,791 --> 01:19:39,500
Will you do something for me?

1147
01:19:42,333 --> 01:19:45,250
It has been a while since
the social audit report in connection

1148
01:19:45,333 --> 01:19:47,375
with Munawwarpur's shelter homes
was published.

1149
01:19:48,083 --> 01:19:53,750
Seems like the state government
is still sleeping over it.

1150
01:19:54,333 --> 01:19:55,666
None of the media houses,

1151
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:58,041
be it print or TV,
is shedding any light on it,

1152
01:19:58,125 --> 01:20:00,875
nor is it being investigated.

1153
01:20:00,958 --> 01:20:06,458
Remember, we brought this news
to you first.

1154
01:20:06,541 --> 01:20:09,791
A lawyer from Munawwarpur court
filed a PIL

1155
01:20:09,875 --> 01:20:13,375
in the Patna High Court
after hearing this news.

1156
01:20:13,458 --> 01:20:17,791
Today, this lawyer was brutally attacked
by a person named Sonu,

1157
01:20:17,875 --> 01:20:21,250
who fatally injured him
right outside the court.

1158
01:20:21,333 --> 01:20:22,416
That's not all.

1159
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:24,916
Munawwarpur Police
expressed their hesitation

1160
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,541
in mentioning any names
in their complaint.

1161
01:20:27,625 --> 01:20:30,250
Maybe they are under
some kind of pressure, but we are not.

1162
01:20:30,833 --> 01:20:32,875
Starting today,
we'll broadcast a special program

1163
01:20:32,958 --> 01:20:35,125
on our channel every day called <i>Bhakshak</i>.

1164
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:40,000
Through this report,
we'll bring all the information to you,

1165
01:20:40,083 --> 01:20:43,541
and we'll keep doing it
until this case isn't tried

1166
01:20:43,625 --> 01:20:46,583
and the people connected
aren't brought to justice.

1167
01:20:46,666 --> 01:20:50,041
Remember, one person
cannot bring about a change.

1168
01:20:50,125 --> 01:20:52,625
<i>We need your help.</i>

1169
01:20:52,708 --> 01:20:54,250
- What are you looking at?
<i>- I am...</i>

1170
01:20:54,333 --> 01:20:55,916
That we only got 400 views so far.

1171
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,500
Soon, we'll get 1,000 views,
wait and watch. Only 400.

1172
01:20:59,541 --> 01:21:04,791
Madam, who do you think filed the PIL?

1173
01:21:07,625 --> 01:21:10,000
I don't know yet, Mr. Bhaskar,

1174
01:21:11,250 --> 01:21:12,750
but I feel terrible

1175
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,291
about what happened
with my brother-in-law.

1176
01:21:15,375 --> 01:21:18,208
- I mean, he is still my family member.
- Of course.

1177
01:21:18,291 --> 01:21:19,708
He's your brother-in-law.

1178
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:22,750
Don't be sad.

1179
01:21:23,708 --> 01:21:26,625
There are always two perspectives
to look at things.

1180
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:29,000
Good and bad.

1181
01:21:29,875 --> 01:21:31,958
What if we look at it the other way?

1182
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,625
He kept sticking his foot in your matters.

1183
01:21:39,583 --> 01:21:40,958
As a result,

1184
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:42,791
someone broke his legs.

1185
01:21:43,375 --> 01:21:44,291
Broke his legs...

1186
01:21:47,583 --> 01:21:49,041
I imagined his face.

1187
01:21:52,166 --> 01:21:54,333
He's your brother-in-law. Sorry.

1188
01:21:56,416 --> 01:21:58,291
Do you know where's today's newspaper?

1189
01:21:58,375 --> 01:22:00,083
Hey! Get up!

1190
01:22:00,958 --> 01:22:02,875
You're sitting on today's newspaper!

1191
01:22:02,958 --> 01:22:04,375
You have no manners at all.

1192
01:22:04,458 --> 01:22:06,375
This is called manners.

1193
01:22:06,458 --> 01:22:09,333
SSP Jasmeet Gaur. See!

1194
01:22:10,958 --> 01:22:12,583
IPS from Punjab.

1195
01:22:13,083 --> 01:22:14,750
This is her first posting here.

1196
01:22:14,833 --> 01:22:19,333
She's the first lady SP
in the history of Munawwarpur.

1197
01:22:20,458 --> 01:22:22,750
She taught them a good lesson.

1198
01:22:22,833 --> 01:22:24,291
I have her number.

1199
01:22:24,375 --> 01:22:27,041
You can speak to her if you want
or go meet her.

1200
01:22:27,625 --> 01:22:28,708
What do you say?

1201
01:22:31,708 --> 01:22:34,083
You aren't saying anything.
That means we are visiting her.

1202
01:22:45,375 --> 01:22:46,750
<i>Did you notice something, madam?</i>

1203
01:22:46,833 --> 01:22:50,583
- Tell me.
- Ladies have really done a good job.

1204
01:22:56,958 --> 01:22:58,458
Let's ask over there.

1205
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:01,500
Hello, madam.

1206
01:23:01,583 --> 01:23:03,625
{\an8}We have a meeting with madam.

1207
01:23:03,708 --> 01:23:05,791
{\an8}I am from Patna. Vaishali Singh.

1208
01:23:12,083 --> 01:23:12,916
Hello.

1209
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,583
Vaishali. Come in.

1210
01:23:16,958 --> 01:23:18,583
How do you know my name?

1211
01:23:18,666 --> 01:23:21,208
I saw your video. Have a seat.

1212
01:23:21,291 --> 01:23:24,250
- And you?
- I am Bhaskar, her colleague.

1213
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:25,458
Koshish News.

1214
01:23:26,458 --> 01:23:29,583
Vaishali, I apologize for what happened
with your brother-in-law.

1215
01:23:30,375 --> 01:23:31,500
You stated in the video

1216
01:23:31,583 --> 01:23:33,833
that Munawwarpur Police
is not filing your complaint.

1217
01:23:33,916 --> 01:23:35,000
Yes, madam.

1218
01:23:35,083 --> 01:23:36,750
I personally went there to file an FIR.

1219
01:23:36,833 --> 01:23:38,500
- Was it the Town Police Station?
- Yes.

1220
01:23:38,583 --> 01:23:40,041
Do you remember who was on duty?

1221
01:23:40,125 --> 01:23:41,333
Prabhat Kumar, madam.

1222
01:23:44,458 --> 01:23:47,750
Cancel Town Police Station in charge,
Prabhat Kumar's duty roster,

1223
01:23:47,833 --> 01:23:49,208
and tell him to meet me tomorrow.

1224
01:23:51,666 --> 01:23:52,958
Don't worry. I will look into it.

1225
01:23:53,833 --> 01:23:56,875
You were talking about some discrepancies
at the shelter home in your video.

1226
01:23:56,958 --> 01:23:58,000
Yes, madam.

1227
01:23:58,083 --> 01:24:03,333
The social audit states that the girls
in the shelter homes are abused.

1228
01:24:04,333 --> 01:24:05,625
The case comes under POCSO.

1229
01:24:05,708 --> 01:24:09,041
Yes, Protection of Children
Against Sexual Offences, madam.

1230
01:24:11,458 --> 01:24:13,000
Many big people will get exposed,

1231
01:24:13,083 --> 01:24:15,458
that's why they are suppressing the names.

1232
01:24:15,541 --> 01:24:16,375
Yes.

1233
01:24:19,458 --> 01:24:21,375
Don't get me wrong.

1234
01:24:21,458 --> 01:24:23,875
But this report could be wrong too.

1235
01:24:23,958 --> 01:24:28,166
The media shouldn't run anything
without firm evidence.

1236
01:24:28,250 --> 01:24:30,625
I mean, you cannot act
or pass judgment like the court, right?

1237
01:24:32,958 --> 01:24:34,125
You're right, madam.

1238
01:24:34,208 --> 01:24:37,875
I'm not trying to act
or pass any verdict like the court.

1239
01:24:37,958 --> 01:24:39,291
I'm only raising a question.

1240
01:24:39,375 --> 01:24:41,750
If this report has been published
for so long,

1241
01:24:41,833 --> 01:24:44,333
then why hasn't it been investigated yet?

1242
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:48,208
I mean, does the government believe
this report is wrong?

1243
01:24:49,625 --> 01:24:51,458
I'll talk to you later. Hang up.

1244
01:24:53,375 --> 01:24:54,625
You were saying?

1245
01:24:54,708 --> 01:24:57,708
How can we believe it's wrong
until it's not investigated?

1246
01:24:59,083 --> 01:25:00,916
Why didn't you file an FIR, Vaishali?

1247
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,583
Every common man has this right.

1248
01:25:02,666 --> 01:25:04,041
I didn't file an FIR,

1249
01:25:04,125 --> 01:25:07,125
but someone has filed a PIL.

1250
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,083
And the results are in front of you.

1251
01:25:13,708 --> 01:25:18,333
I'll talk to my superiors
and see what I can do.

1252
01:25:29,208 --> 01:25:30,583
His zipper was stuck.

1253
01:25:35,333 --> 01:25:37,958
Both Sinha and Mohan
were running for life!

1254
01:25:45,333 --> 01:25:46,416
Master.

1255
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:49,250
{\an8}GIRLS' SHELTER HOME,
MUNAWWARPUR

1256
01:25:49,333 --> 01:25:52,333
JAN SEVA DAL

1257
01:25:57,875 --> 01:26:01,041
Hello, inspector.
Did you take a wrong turn?

1258
01:26:01,125 --> 01:26:02,625
Why would I miss a turn?

1259
01:26:02,708 --> 01:26:03,791
Is Sonu here?

1260
01:26:04,791 --> 01:26:05,625
Who?

1261
01:26:05,708 --> 01:26:06,625
Sonu.

1262
01:26:06,708 --> 01:26:08,333
I have an arrest warrant against him.

1263
01:26:09,375 --> 01:26:10,375
So what?

1264
01:26:10,458 --> 01:26:12,291
What else? I've come to arrest him.

1265
01:26:13,291 --> 01:26:14,125
Go check inside.

1266
01:26:14,208 --> 01:26:15,708
Hey! Back off!

1267
01:26:16,708 --> 01:26:18,375
{\an8}Did you drink too much last night?

1268
01:26:18,458 --> 01:26:21,000
{\an8}We'll take a look around

1269
01:26:21,083 --> 01:26:22,625
and leave if he isn't here.

1270
01:26:22,708 --> 01:26:25,333
I said there's no Sonu here.

1271
01:26:25,416 --> 01:26:26,708
Don't you get it?

1272
01:26:27,833 --> 01:26:28,875
{\an8}Sir, greetings.

1273
01:26:28,958 --> 01:26:30,000
Hello.

1274
01:26:30,083 --> 01:26:32,625
SSP Madam is looking into
this matter personally.

1275
01:26:32,708 --> 01:26:34,458
I'll have to arrest him.

1276
01:26:35,333 --> 01:26:37,833
Tell her he isn't here.

1277
01:26:38,583 --> 01:26:39,875
She's the SSP.

1278
01:26:39,958 --> 01:26:42,250
I would've managed it
if it was just the station in charge.

1279
01:26:46,291 --> 01:26:48,375
Hop in your car and get out.

1280
01:26:48,458 --> 01:26:49,583
What?

1281
01:26:50,083 --> 01:26:52,458
I won't repeat myself. Understood?

1282
01:26:57,666 --> 01:26:59,500
Hey! Get in the car!

1283
01:26:59,583 --> 01:27:00,875
See you.

1284
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:12,416
Is this a circus going on here?

1285
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:13,583
Get lost!

1286
01:27:20,958 --> 01:27:22,083
Get lost!

1287
01:27:25,833 --> 01:27:29,000
If I had given this same news
to some other reporters,

1288
01:27:29,083 --> 01:27:30,625
he would've given me 500,000 rupees.

1289
01:27:30,708 --> 01:27:32,875
Here, I'm getting paid far less
and not even on time.

1290
01:27:33,708 --> 01:27:35,250
We already paid you half the sum.

1291
01:27:35,333 --> 01:27:37,708
You'll get the rest
when madam comes back. Leave.

1292
01:27:37,791 --> 01:27:40,000
I should've given you only half the news.

1293
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:43,583
People like you should be given leads
only after you pay in full.

1294
01:27:45,375 --> 01:27:47,208
How much longer
are you going to embarrass us?

1295
01:27:48,083 --> 01:27:49,250
Don't you get it?

1296
01:27:49,333 --> 01:27:51,375
We're asking for more time,
not for your kidney.

1297
01:27:51,458 --> 01:27:52,625
If this continues,

1298
01:27:52,708 --> 01:27:55,125
then I'll have to sell my kidney someday.

1299
01:27:55,208 --> 01:27:58,208
The wedding's around the corner
and you guys are giving me a headache.

1300
01:27:58,958 --> 01:28:01,000
The guy who called me an asshole
was right.

1301
01:28:01,083 --> 01:28:03,625
I was a bigger asshole to file a PIL,

1302
01:28:03,708 --> 01:28:06,500
so I could find more information
for you guys.

1303
01:28:06,583 --> 01:28:09,333
- But you are making my life hell--
- Wait a second!

1304
01:28:10,791 --> 01:28:14,000
The PIL against the state government
was filed by you?

1305
01:28:14,083 --> 01:28:16,125
Of course. Who else has the guts to do it?

1306
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:19,916
Goodness! You showed your guts and
your brother-in-law got thrashed for it.

1307
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,750
Whose brother-in-law?

1308
01:28:21,833 --> 01:28:23,041
That guy wasn't wrong.

1309
01:28:23,125 --> 01:28:24,750
Let me make it clearer for you.

1310
01:28:24,833 --> 01:28:26,875
You don't just look like an asshole,
but you think like one too.

1311
01:28:26,958 --> 01:28:28,458
What are you saying?

1312
01:28:29,041 --> 01:28:30,833
I am calling you an asshole.

1313
01:28:33,958 --> 01:28:34,833
What happened?

1314
01:28:35,958 --> 01:28:37,583
I came to get my cap.

1315
01:28:38,458 --> 01:28:41,958
Until we don't get a green signal
from the Social Welfare Department,

1316
01:28:42,041 --> 01:28:43,958
taking any action in this matter
won't be right.

1317
01:28:44,041 --> 01:28:45,750
This case is connected to girls.

1318
01:28:45,833 --> 01:28:49,500
If it misfires,
we'll be the only ones humiliated.

1319
01:28:50,208 --> 01:28:53,750
Sir, when will we get the green signal
from the Social Welfare Department?

1320
01:28:53,833 --> 01:28:55,416
Will we ever get a go-ahead or not?

1321
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:58,791
They've had the report for two months,
but no action has been taken.

1322
01:28:59,333 --> 01:29:00,750
The case is connected to girls.

1323
01:29:00,833 --> 01:29:03,750
If this doesn't misfire,
we'll be exposing a huge racket.

1324
01:29:03,833 --> 01:29:05,708
Sir, I think we should take the risk.

1325
01:29:07,291 --> 01:29:10,333
Respect the stars on your uniform.

1326
01:29:10,833 --> 01:29:14,000
I've seen several people
losing these stars

1327
01:29:14,083 --> 01:29:15,833
for taking risks.

1328
01:29:16,833 --> 01:29:18,458
And you're doing a good job.

1329
01:29:19,333 --> 01:29:22,833
Common men are wearing helmets
while riding their bikes on the streets.

1330
01:29:23,333 --> 01:29:25,458
I am confident that
soon you'll educate them

1331
01:29:25,958 --> 01:29:29,125
about wearing a seatbelt as well.

1332
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:39,208
{\an8}OFFICE, INSPECTOR GENERAL OF POLICE,
MUNAWWARPUR, BIHAR

1333
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:01,833
RESIDENCE, SENIOR SUPERINTENDENT
OF POLICE, MUNAWWARPUR

1334
01:30:05,083 --> 01:30:07,375
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

1335
01:30:07,458 --> 01:30:09,583
Are you sure you'll only have tea?
Nothing to eat?

1336
01:30:10,250 --> 01:30:11,916
No, I am fine.

1337
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,083
You asked to meet, so I was a little...

1338
01:30:16,208 --> 01:30:18,541
The police tried to arrest Sonu yesterday.

1339
01:30:21,083 --> 01:30:22,458
Did he get arrested?

1340
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,583
Bansi Sahu didn't let the police enter.

1341
01:30:27,625 --> 01:30:29,875
And I'm confident that
it wouldn't have made any difference

1342
01:30:29,958 --> 01:30:31,208
even if the police had barged in.

1343
01:30:33,166 --> 01:30:35,083
So what will we do now?

1344
01:30:35,958 --> 01:30:37,625
Honestly speaking, Vaishali.

1345
01:30:37,708 --> 01:30:40,958
We cannot take any action
after reading this report.

1346
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:46,708
Especially when we don't have
the official report.

1347
01:30:47,833 --> 01:30:51,458
And we cannot use your brother-in-law
to our advantage.

1348
01:30:52,458 --> 01:30:55,625
If they prove in court
that it was just a mere coincidence,

1349
01:30:55,708 --> 01:30:57,333
then that will be the end of it.

1350
01:30:59,083 --> 01:31:01,583
And as for Bansi Sahu...

1351
01:31:01,666 --> 01:31:04,250
Even if he's done something wrong,

1352
01:31:04,333 --> 01:31:06,833
it won't be easy to expose him.

1353
01:31:08,333 --> 01:31:10,625
You've started reporting him,

1354
01:31:10,708 --> 01:31:12,500
which means he is on alert.

1355
01:31:12,583 --> 01:31:16,500
Secondly, if the government
had this report for a couple of months

1356
01:31:16,583 --> 01:31:19,125
and they haven't taken any action,

1357
01:31:19,208 --> 01:31:22,208
you can imagine Bansi Sahu's connections.

1358
01:31:26,208 --> 01:31:28,958
Madam, you've left no options.

1359
01:31:33,750 --> 01:31:36,208
There's only one person
who can find some options.

1360
01:31:37,708 --> 01:31:38,916
Who?

1361
01:31:41,083 --> 01:31:42,083
You.

1362
01:31:50,375 --> 01:31:51,750
We'll have to put pressure

1363
01:31:51,833 --> 01:31:54,000
on the Social Welfare Department,
Mr. Bhaskar.

1364
01:31:54,083 --> 01:31:55,500
Only then can we expect some action.

1365
01:31:56,875 --> 01:32:00,125
It's a dangerous department.
They don't allow anyone inside.

1366
01:32:00,208 --> 01:32:02,250
Everyone's a pro in their field.

1367
01:32:02,333 --> 01:32:04,250
We cannot trick them.

1368
01:32:04,833 --> 01:32:06,000
So?

1369
01:32:06,083 --> 01:32:08,125
Even cricketer Sachin Tendulkar
was a pro in his game,

1370
01:32:08,208 --> 01:32:10,791
but sometimes even he used to get out.
Yes or no?

1371
01:32:10,875 --> 01:32:13,458
How did Sachin get involved in all this?

1372
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:18,208
There must be some trick up our sleeve
that they aren't expecting.

1373
01:32:19,208 --> 01:32:21,583
One wrong ball and out.

1374
01:32:22,208 --> 01:32:23,625
We just have to try.

1375
01:32:24,625 --> 01:32:28,250
And we need to put pressure
on Minister Rajni Singh as well.

1376
01:32:28,333 --> 01:32:31,583
You see, the fear of losing power
is far worse than the fear of death.

1377
01:32:31,666 --> 01:32:33,000
And that's what we have to target.

1378
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:35,583
Her husband is Brijmohan.

1379
01:32:37,083 --> 01:32:38,416
But there's nothing he can do.

1380
01:32:43,416 --> 01:32:45,375
Have you ever done theater
in school or college?

1381
01:32:46,458 --> 01:32:48,666
Yes. Several times.

1382
01:32:48,750 --> 01:32:51,666
I've played Ram, Raavan.

1383
01:32:51,750 --> 01:32:54,875
Girls were crazy about me.
They were my fans.

1384
01:32:54,958 --> 01:32:57,083
Juniors and seniors alike.

1385
01:32:57,666 --> 01:33:00,208
You got to perform again.

1386
01:33:00,958 --> 01:33:01,958
Will you?

1387
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,166
Madam.

1388
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:09,375
Madam, just direct me to a stage

1389
01:33:09,458 --> 01:33:11,000
and watch in awe.

1390
01:33:11,750 --> 01:33:14,166
Raju, if you can't fix it,
then go make some tea.

1391
01:33:14,250 --> 01:33:16,375
JAN ADHIKAR PARTY

1392
01:33:16,458 --> 01:33:19,750
His pictures used to be in the newspaper.
Now the newspaper is on his picture.

1393
01:33:19,833 --> 01:33:21,416
You know what, do some good work.

1394
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:24,041
The minister is furious with you.
Understood?

1395
01:33:24,125 --> 01:33:25,458
Mister.

1396
01:33:26,958 --> 01:33:30,541
You put a newspaper patch
on Vinayak Yadav's picture.

1397
01:33:30,625 --> 01:33:32,625
Isn't he one of your main leaders?

1398
01:33:32,708 --> 01:33:35,041
He was, but not anymore.

1399
01:33:35,708 --> 01:33:36,625
Who are you?

1400
01:33:37,208 --> 01:33:39,375
I want to speak with Mr. Brij.

1401
01:33:39,458 --> 01:33:40,583
What should I do?

1402
01:33:41,166 --> 01:33:42,083
What do you want?

1403
01:33:42,583 --> 01:33:44,500
I just want to speak with him.

1404
01:33:45,375 --> 01:33:46,458
It's private.

1405
01:33:46,541 --> 01:33:48,291
What's so private?

1406
01:33:49,250 --> 01:33:52,000
It's a private matter,
so I'll speak to him in private.

1407
01:33:52,750 --> 01:33:54,125
This is not done.

1408
01:33:54,875 --> 01:33:56,125
Tell me first.

1409
01:33:56,750 --> 01:33:58,541
I'll hear you out, then decide.

1410
01:33:58,625 --> 01:34:00,625
If I am convinced, then I'll inform him.

1411
01:34:00,708 --> 01:34:03,125
That's a pretty long process.

1412
01:34:03,208 --> 01:34:04,916
- Do you understand private?
- Yes.

1413
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,250
This is important.

1414
01:34:06,333 --> 01:34:08,916
I understand, but it seems like you don't.

1415
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:09,916
Go out.

1416
01:34:10,875 --> 01:34:13,875
If I go out, Mr. Brij will have to go in.

1417
01:34:14,875 --> 01:34:16,958
Try to understand the complexity
of the situation.

1418
01:34:17,041 --> 01:34:18,875
Don't waste time and inform him.

1419
01:34:19,833 --> 01:34:21,208
That I want to speak with him.

1420
01:34:23,083 --> 01:34:26,291
And also tell him
that the person waiting outside

1421
01:34:26,375 --> 01:34:28,416
wants to speak about Mr. Bansi.

1422
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:30,041
Bansi Sahu from Munawwarpur.

1423
01:34:30,125 --> 01:34:31,291
I'm sure you've heard his name.

1424
01:34:33,625 --> 01:34:34,625
Sit.

1425
01:34:45,791 --> 01:34:47,958
Never keep the mobile in your left pocket.

1426
01:34:48,541 --> 01:34:50,166
It causes heart problems.

1427
01:34:54,750 --> 01:34:56,166
Where did you read it?

1428
01:34:56,250 --> 01:34:57,125
WhatsApp.

1429
01:34:58,625 --> 01:34:59,875
I thought so.

1430
01:35:00,375 --> 01:35:01,750
Anything wrong?

1431
01:35:01,833 --> 01:35:02,750
No, sir. It's all good.

1432
01:35:02,833 --> 01:35:04,750
What can go wrong when you're around?

1433
01:35:04,833 --> 01:35:07,500
- You know the media...
- Yes.

1434
01:35:11,125 --> 01:35:12,833
- Greetings, sir.
- That's all right.

1435
01:35:13,333 --> 01:35:15,250
Sir, I made a huge mistake.

1436
01:35:15,333 --> 01:35:17,541
I came to meet you pretty late.

1437
01:35:19,333 --> 01:35:20,291
What's your name?

1438
01:35:20,875 --> 01:35:21,833
Bhaskar.

1439
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:24,166
Vaishali Singh, the reporter.

1440
01:35:24,250 --> 01:35:28,541
Together, we run a news channel
called Koshish News.

1441
01:35:28,625 --> 01:35:31,625
Currently, we are reporting
about the girls' shelter home.

1442
01:35:32,708 --> 01:35:33,958
What can I do?

1443
01:35:34,708 --> 01:35:38,208
Vaishali Singh has some
pretty hard evidence against you

1444
01:35:38,291 --> 01:35:41,000
in connection with the shelter home case.

1445
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:44,583
I mean, madam's name is coming up too.

1446
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:51,416
I don't know any girls' shelter home.

1447
01:35:52,083 --> 01:35:53,333
See...

1448
01:35:54,375 --> 01:35:57,000
I know that you're a decent man.

1449
01:35:57,083 --> 01:35:58,958
She's unnecessarily involving you
in this matter.

1450
01:35:59,958 --> 01:36:04,833
Some Mithilesh Sinha from CWC
is supplying her with all the information.

1451
01:36:13,708 --> 01:36:14,958
Please wait outside.

1452
01:36:15,958 --> 01:36:17,750
See you, sir.

1453
01:36:18,250 --> 01:36:19,875
- Goodbye.
- Yes.

1454
01:36:31,208 --> 01:36:32,833
What was Mithilesh saying?

1455
01:36:35,583 --> 01:36:38,875
He said that the girls in the shelter home

1456
01:36:38,958 --> 01:36:41,791
were being abused and tortured.

1457
01:36:42,375 --> 01:36:46,291
Some woman called Baby Rani
has also been named.

1458
01:36:46,375 --> 01:36:48,041
Also Nafisa.

1459
01:36:48,125 --> 01:36:49,875
He claims that the girls are drugged,

1460
01:36:49,958 --> 01:36:51,958
stripped and made to sleep naked.

1461
01:36:52,583 --> 01:36:54,833
Some Baccha Babu
is also involved in all this.

1462
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:58,791
What I don't understand is that
you're unaware of all this.

1463
01:36:58,875 --> 01:37:02,041
You don't seem like a person
who would do such a thing.

1464
01:37:02,125 --> 01:37:05,208
Why is Vaishali Singh
making a fool out of me?

1465
01:37:05,958 --> 01:37:07,291
Do you understand?

1466
01:37:07,375 --> 01:37:11,583
That motherfucker Mithilesh also said that
sometimes you go over there for pleasure.

1467
01:37:13,416 --> 01:37:14,250
Understood?

1468
01:37:14,333 --> 01:37:16,625
He'll become an approver
and get you all in trouble.

1469
01:37:16,708 --> 01:37:18,750
I don't want to see you in trouble,

1470
01:37:18,833 --> 01:37:20,625
that's why I am telling you all this

1471
01:37:20,708 --> 01:37:22,000
because I am a follower of yours.

1472
01:37:24,958 --> 01:37:26,958
Why are you being such a well-wisher?

1473
01:37:27,041 --> 01:37:29,625
No! I am not your well-wisher, sir.

1474
01:37:29,708 --> 01:37:31,125
Follower.

1475
01:37:31,208 --> 01:37:32,708
I've just been unlucky these days.

1476
01:37:33,583 --> 01:37:34,916
Mom is on her deathbed,

1477
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,583
so I thought you could help me out.
You're rich people.

1478
01:37:39,583 --> 01:37:41,000
I would be really thankful.

1479
01:37:49,833 --> 01:37:50,958
Here.

1480
01:37:51,458 --> 01:37:54,583
- I don't want money--
- Keep it.

1481
01:37:55,250 --> 01:37:57,083
Take it.

1482
01:38:00,416 --> 01:38:04,916
And don't tell anyone
that you came to meet me.

1483
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,250
No, sir.

1484
01:38:06,333 --> 01:38:08,166
But if you have any more information,

1485
01:38:08,250 --> 01:38:09,791
then come tell me.

1486
01:38:09,875 --> 01:38:10,875
Okay?

1487
01:38:13,125 --> 01:38:15,625
Definitely, sir. I promise.

1488
01:38:16,833 --> 01:38:21,583
On any other day,
I would've taken a selfie with you.

1489
01:38:22,875 --> 01:38:24,000
Yes.

1490
01:38:24,625 --> 01:38:25,875
See you later, sir.

1491
01:38:43,541 --> 01:38:45,166
Hello, this is Vaishali Singh,

1492
01:38:45,250 --> 01:38:50,000
bringing you
our special program, <i>Bhakshak</i>.

1493
01:38:50,625 --> 01:38:54,000
The lawyer who was attacked
is still in the hospital,

1494
01:38:54,083 --> 01:38:56,875
but his condition is much better.

1495
01:38:57,375 --> 01:39:00,166
But the system is not.

1496
01:39:00,250 --> 01:39:02,166
The police have registered an FIR

1497
01:39:02,250 --> 01:39:05,625
under SSP Jasmeet Gaur's pressure.

1498
01:39:05,708 --> 01:39:09,166
But the police failed to arrest Sonu.

1499
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:13,791
Fun fact is Sonu works
for the same girls' shelter home,

1500
01:39:13,875 --> 01:39:17,583
which we've been reporting on our channel
for the past couple of days.

1501
01:39:18,708 --> 01:39:22,916
The police claim that the owner
of the girls' shelter home, Bansi Sahu,

1502
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:26,625
came forward to stop the arrest.

1503
01:39:27,333 --> 01:39:30,166
Bansi Sahu misbehaved with the police

1504
01:39:30,250 --> 01:39:33,375
and did not let them set foot
inside the girls' shelter home.

1505
01:39:34,583 --> 01:39:37,166
What's so special
about the girls' shelter home,

1506
01:39:37,250 --> 01:39:40,541
which Bansi Sahu is trying to hide?

1507
01:39:40,625 --> 01:39:44,666
What connections do the state government
have with the girls' shelter home

1508
01:39:44,750 --> 01:39:47,458
that they aren't taking
any action in this matter?

1509
01:39:48,125 --> 01:39:53,750
But for now, we'll keep talking
on this matter without any hesitation

1510
01:39:53,833 --> 01:40:00,125
until the government doesn't take
any firm steps in this matter.

1511
01:40:00,208 --> 01:40:04,583
This is Vaishali Singh with Cameraman
Bhaskar Sinha for Koshish News, Patna.

1512
01:40:05,250 --> 01:40:07,333
So if I click here,
my YouTube page will open.

1513
01:40:07,416 --> 01:40:08,625
Yes.

1514
01:40:09,208 --> 01:40:10,500
But it's got only 60 views.

1515
01:40:10,583 --> 01:40:11,916
It will increase gradually.

1516
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,166
- Will it?
- Yes.

1517
01:40:14,708 --> 01:40:15,833
You're back again.

1518
01:40:21,500 --> 01:40:23,166
How are you, Guptaji? Is everything okay?

1519
01:40:23,250 --> 01:40:24,583
I'm still alive.

1520
01:40:24,666 --> 01:40:27,833
I saw your scooter parked downstairs
and I thought I'd try my luck.

1521
01:40:28,458 --> 01:40:29,583
Will I get paid?

1522
01:40:32,375 --> 01:40:34,041
Give me two days. I'll pay you.

1523
01:40:34,125 --> 01:40:34,958
I promise.

1524
01:40:36,833 --> 01:40:40,166
Madam, you're working very hard.
You're very inspiring.

1525
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:42,708
The world is filled with stupid reporters.

1526
01:40:43,833 --> 01:40:47,541
This is why I want to give you
another piece of news free of charge.

1527
01:40:47,625 --> 01:40:48,833
Tell me.

1528
01:40:51,791 --> 01:40:56,166
Sitamarhi Social Welfare Department's
officer, Satyajit Dubey,

1529
01:40:56,250 --> 01:40:58,250
was murdered four days ago.

1530
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:05,041
Some group that runs
the scholarship scam killed him.

1531
01:41:05,125 --> 01:41:06,541
He was shot three times.

1532
01:41:06,625 --> 01:41:08,583
It's an open-and-shut case.

1533
01:41:08,666 --> 01:41:11,833
Now you see how you want to use this news.

1534
01:41:11,916 --> 01:41:15,041
Because if you change
the perspective of the news,

1535
01:41:15,125 --> 01:41:17,041
it always presents a new direction.

1536
01:41:18,875 --> 01:41:20,166
See you.

1537
01:41:21,875 --> 01:41:27,166
Mr. Bhaskar, you said I'm an asshole.

1538
01:41:27,750 --> 01:41:30,250
I don't know whether
anyone told you this or not,

1539
01:41:30,333 --> 01:41:32,541
but let me be clear.

1540
01:41:32,625 --> 01:41:37,416
That you look, think like an asshole,
but also your genes are of an asshole too.

1541
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:38,583
Goodbye.

1542
01:41:44,166 --> 01:41:46,833
Your dad's being abused
and you think it's funny?

1543
01:41:47,958 --> 01:41:50,083
Don't tell your mom
what happens in the office.

1544
01:41:50,750 --> 01:41:52,750
Don't pay him for more couple of days.

1545
01:41:54,250 --> 01:41:56,583
But his news is correct.

1546
01:41:59,750 --> 01:42:03,583
{\an8}Pay in cash for the newspaper tender.

1547
01:42:04,375 --> 01:42:07,416
{\an8}If you keep records,
then people are going to ask questions.

1548
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:09,125
Have you grown old?

1549
01:42:10,333 --> 01:42:13,500
The money received
from the shelter home is legal.

1550
01:42:13,583 --> 01:42:15,375
Spend that on other things.

1551
01:42:15,458 --> 01:42:17,375
Show small expenses.

1552
01:42:17,458 --> 01:42:19,208
Otherwise, I'll appoint someone else.

1553
01:42:20,875 --> 01:42:22,333
What the fuck are you saying?

1554
01:42:22,416 --> 01:42:23,458
Spit that out first!

1555
01:42:23,541 --> 01:42:24,708
Get lost!

1556
01:42:27,291 --> 01:42:29,708
He's made a mess of the office.

1557
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,791
Good evening, Mr. Singh.

1558
01:42:34,875 --> 01:42:37,375
What a two-faced man you are!

1559
01:42:37,958 --> 01:42:41,791
Screwing the guy that's supporting you!

1560
01:42:41,875 --> 01:42:43,791
Why do you sound agitated?

1561
01:42:43,875 --> 01:42:45,375
<i>I am not agitated.</i>

1562
01:42:45,458 --> 01:42:47,791
<i>That Mithilesh Sinha's shit-scared.</i>

1563
01:42:47,875 --> 01:42:49,875
<i>He wants to become an approver.</i>

1564
01:42:50,375 --> 01:42:54,666
<i>He spilled all the beans before Vaishali
on what we do with the girls.</i>

1565
01:42:54,750 --> 01:42:58,500
<i>Now, when this reporter
strips you naked publicly,</i>

1566
01:42:58,583 --> 01:43:00,625
then don't come running to me!

1567
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:03,750
Hello?

1568
01:43:16,916 --> 01:43:18,750
Motherfucker.

1569
01:43:19,958 --> 01:43:21,166
Why are you hitting me?

1570
01:43:21,250 --> 01:43:23,000
- Why are you hitting me?
- Fucker.

1571
01:43:23,083 --> 01:43:24,041
Why are you hitting me?

1572
01:43:24,125 --> 01:43:26,625
Sir, what happened?

1573
01:43:26,708 --> 01:43:30,000
- Brother...
- He's become an approver.

1574
01:43:30,083 --> 01:43:32,375
- Him?
- He's told Vaishali everything.

1575
01:43:32,458 --> 01:43:34,583
- That's a lie!
- Someone's lying.

1576
01:43:34,666 --> 01:43:36,375
- Sir...
- Someone's lying.

1577
01:43:36,458 --> 01:43:37,416
Sir...

1578
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:38,666
- Someone's lying.
- Sir.

1579
01:43:38,750 --> 01:43:40,250
- Sir...
- Someone's lying.

1580
01:43:40,333 --> 01:43:42,125
Sir, your hands will wear out.
Use this stick.

1581
01:43:42,208 --> 01:43:44,375
- This will hurt badly.
- Not with the shoe!

1582
01:43:44,458 --> 01:43:45,500
Not with the shoe!

1583
01:43:45,583 --> 01:43:46,666
Bastard...

1584
01:43:46,750 --> 01:43:49,125
Kick my ass!

1585
01:43:49,208 --> 01:43:52,750
I'll break your ass,
you won't be able to shit in the morning.

1586
01:43:52,833 --> 01:43:53,958
Why you...

1587
01:43:54,625 --> 01:43:56,500
Do you want to kill me?

1588
01:43:56,583 --> 01:43:57,625
How dare he?

1589
01:43:57,708 --> 01:44:00,625
I swear, someone's provoking you.

1590
01:44:01,375 --> 01:44:04,083
Someone's lying to you.

1591
01:44:09,375 --> 01:44:11,166
You hit me with your shoe.

1592
01:44:11,250 --> 01:44:12,583
That wasn't right.

1593
01:44:13,583 --> 01:44:15,875
How dare you betray us?
This is what you do?

1594
01:44:15,958 --> 01:44:17,500
I'll break your neck.

1595
01:44:17,583 --> 01:44:18,750
Are you ready, madam?

1596
01:44:18,833 --> 01:44:20,833
Ajit, start recording.

1597
01:44:22,875 --> 01:44:24,541
What are you doing?

1598
01:44:24,625 --> 01:44:25,750
That's a plain paper.

1599
01:44:26,250 --> 01:44:27,583
I know.

1600
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,708
I'm going to write
Bansi Sahu's destiny on it.

1601
01:44:36,583 --> 01:44:38,333
<i>Hello, this is Vaishali Singh.</i>

1602
01:44:38,416 --> 01:44:41,791
<i>Bringing you our special program,</i>
Bhakshak,

1603
01:44:41,875 --> 01:44:43,958
<i>based on the Munawwarpur shelter home.</i>

1604
01:44:44,041 --> 01:44:47,916
There are several questions in connection
with the Munawwarpur shelter home,

1605
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,875
which makes us restless.

1606
01:44:50,458 --> 01:44:56,666
The truth is,
honest people have no say in this.

1607
01:44:57,750 --> 01:45:03,791
Four days ago, an officer from Sitamarhi
Social Welfare Department was shot dead.

1608
01:45:03,875 --> 01:45:08,666
<i>The government claims that a scholarship
scamming group is behind this incident.</i>

1609
01:45:08,750 --> 01:45:12,375
<i>But no arrests have been made
in the past four days.</i>

1610
01:45:12,458 --> 01:45:14,875
And how can you expect
any arrests to be made?

1611
01:45:14,958 --> 01:45:18,416
Because that will expose them.

1612
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:21,458
The public will know the truth.

1613
01:45:22,041 --> 01:45:25,208
<i>But on Koshish News,
we don't work like the police.</i>

1614
01:45:25,291 --> 01:45:27,625
<i>We do a proper investigation</i>

1615
01:45:27,708 --> 01:45:30,708
<i>and bring the truth to our audience.</i>

1616
01:45:31,625 --> 01:45:34,791
Through our investigation, we found out

1617
01:45:34,875 --> 01:45:38,625
that the deceased officer,
Satyajit Dubey, was an honest man.

1618
01:45:39,208 --> 01:45:41,125
He knew the truth about the shelter home

1619
01:45:41,208 --> 01:45:44,250
and was putting pressure
on the government.

1620
01:45:44,750 --> 01:45:45,958
<i>That's not all.</i>

1621
01:45:46,625 --> 01:45:48,166
<i>During our investigation,</i>

1622
01:45:48,250 --> 01:45:51,750
we learned the bitter truth about
the Munawwarpur shelter home.

1623
01:45:53,625 --> 01:45:57,333
<i>We have a complete analogy
of what goes in there</i>

1624
01:45:57,416 --> 01:46:00,000
and how the people are involved.

1625
01:46:00,583 --> 01:46:02,416
<i>Stay tuned with us.</i>

1626
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:05,416
<i>Tomorrow evening,
on our special program,</i> Bhakshak,

1627
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:07,416
<i>we will expose all those names,</i>

1628
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:12,833
<i>ranging from top ministers of the state
to well-known personalities.</i>

1629
01:46:13,958 --> 01:46:18,833
<i>This is Vaishali Singh with Cameraman
Bhaskar Sinha for Koshish News, Patna.</i>

1630
01:46:28,208 --> 01:46:31,583
I can clearly see my resignation letter.

1631
01:46:32,083 --> 01:46:34,375
I wonder what you got me into.

1632
01:46:34,458 --> 01:46:37,083
It wasn't easy getting
this minister's post

1633
01:46:37,583 --> 01:46:39,375
and now you've ruined that as well!

1634
01:46:39,458 --> 01:46:42,750
Will you shut up or keep screaming?

1635
01:46:43,458 --> 01:46:44,500
Let me think!

1636
01:46:45,083 --> 01:46:47,000
Your post is safe.

1637
01:46:47,083 --> 01:46:48,541
I am still here!

1638
01:46:48,625 --> 01:46:50,708
All this will cool down.

1639
01:46:52,875 --> 01:46:56,125
Madam, the chief minister is on call.

1640
01:46:56,208 --> 01:46:57,125
Are you serious?

1641
01:46:57,208 --> 01:46:58,458
He's on the line.

1642
01:47:17,250 --> 01:47:18,125
Hello?

1643
01:47:18,958 --> 01:47:20,125
Good evening, sir!

1644
01:47:21,208 --> 01:47:22,375
Yes.

1645
01:47:23,458 --> 01:47:24,666
Yes.

1646
01:47:24,750 --> 01:47:25,750
What?

1647
01:47:28,208 --> 01:47:29,458
I'll do it, sir.

1648
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,375
Good night, sir.

1649
01:47:50,833 --> 01:47:52,000
What happened?

1650
01:47:54,750 --> 01:47:55,750
Will you tell me?

1651
01:47:56,875 --> 01:47:58,000
Tell me what happened!

1652
01:47:58,083 --> 01:47:59,916
Why are you screaming?

1653
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,875
He's asked me to file an FIR immediately!

1654
01:48:09,583 --> 01:48:11,208
It's pretty cold.

1655
01:48:12,333 --> 01:48:16,166
You know what? Do we have
to go to Munawwarpur in this cold?

1656
01:48:16,250 --> 01:48:18,166
Let's go tomorrow morning after breakfast.

1657
01:48:18,250 --> 01:48:20,458
We have to be on the scene, Mr. Bhaskar.

1658
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,458
What if something happens overnight?

1659
01:48:23,250 --> 01:48:25,500
Wait a second.

1660
01:48:25,583 --> 01:48:27,500
- Who is it?
- Ms. Jasmeet's calling. Wait a second.

1661
01:48:28,833 --> 01:48:30,291
Vaishali, congratulations.

1662
01:48:30,375 --> 01:48:31,375
The FIR has been filed.

1663
01:48:32,125 --> 01:48:33,458
FIR's done, madam?

1664
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:40,875
Now it's your turn, madam.

1665
01:48:42,583 --> 01:48:44,541
Once I get the official orders,

1666
01:48:44,625 --> 01:48:47,666
I'll get the girls out of there.

1667
01:48:47,750 --> 01:48:49,750
I don't know what will happen after that.

1668
01:48:50,500 --> 01:48:52,916
I don't understand, madam.

1669
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,666
What do you mean?

1670
01:48:56,250 --> 01:48:59,416
The state government filed the FIR
in the woman's police station.

1671
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:01,958
This is POCSO's case now, Vaishali,
which is not under me.

1672
01:49:02,625 --> 01:49:06,333
<i>The women's police officer and Child
Welfare Association will take action.</i>

1673
01:49:06,833 --> 01:49:08,166
<i>There will be a raid tomorrow.</i>

1674
01:49:08,250 --> 01:49:10,375
<i>The girls will get out of there.</i>

1675
01:49:10,458 --> 01:49:12,375
<i>Then they will be sent for medical tests.</i>

1676
01:49:12,458 --> 01:49:15,416
<i>Later, they will be handed over
to the Child Welfare Association.</i>

1677
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:19,291
<i>The Child Welfare Association
will record their statement.</i>

1678
01:49:19,375 --> 01:49:22,708
<i>And if anything is proven,
then action will be taken.</i>

1679
01:49:23,625 --> 01:49:26,875
Which Child Welfare Association
are you talking about, madam?

1680
01:49:27,833 --> 01:49:30,416
The one whose head is Mithilesh Sinha?

1681
01:49:30,500 --> 01:49:32,583
He is a rapist himself!

1682
01:49:33,208 --> 01:49:34,583
What report will he make?

1683
01:49:38,750 --> 01:49:40,125
Look, Ms. Jasmeet.

1684
01:49:41,125 --> 01:49:43,583
These people need to be arrested.

1685
01:49:44,708 --> 01:49:46,416
If they don't get arrested,

1686
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:48,250
they will continue doing...

1687
01:49:52,833 --> 01:49:54,083
Now you tell me.

1688
01:49:55,750 --> 01:49:57,875
How do we stop all this, Ms. Jasmeet?

1689
01:49:58,750 --> 01:50:00,625
<i>That's how the system is, Vaishali.</i>

1690
01:50:01,375 --> 01:50:03,166
<i>It bestows power on you with one hand</i>

1691
01:50:03,250 --> 01:50:05,291
<i>and snatches it from you
with the other hand.</i>

1692
01:50:05,375 --> 01:50:09,000
<i>We don't have a report
or evidence against anyone.</i>

1693
01:50:09,583 --> 01:50:12,000
<i>And the court only wants evidence.</i>

1694
01:50:12,083 --> 01:50:13,625
<i>They have nothing to do with reality.</i>

1695
01:50:14,333 --> 01:50:16,083
It is sad but true.

1696
01:50:17,250 --> 01:50:20,083
Don't get your hopes high.
The case is not too strong.

1697
01:50:25,625 --> 01:50:29,958
But madam, what if I get you evidence?

1698
01:50:30,041 --> 01:50:32,125
If you can get evidence,

1699
01:50:32,208 --> 01:50:35,958
then Bansi Sahu will be handcuffed
without anyone's permission.

1700
01:50:42,083 --> 01:50:43,208
What happened?

1701
01:51:17,083 --> 01:51:18,750
Are we preparing for the party?

1702
01:51:18,833 --> 01:51:21,333
We'll be partying in Munawwarpur jail.

1703
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:25,333
Scared of going to jail.

1704
01:51:27,750 --> 01:51:28,833
Stop, everyone.

1705
01:51:34,708 --> 01:51:37,500
This is
a government-recognized organization.

1706
01:51:40,125 --> 01:51:42,833
I won't be facing a trial alone.
Do you get it?

1707
01:51:53,083 --> 01:51:56,083
Listen, Mr. Bansi...

1708
01:51:58,583 --> 01:52:02,375
I have two little daughters.

1709
01:52:04,375 --> 01:52:05,833
I am a dad.

1710
01:52:08,750 --> 01:52:10,375
I am the dad here.

1711
01:52:12,708 --> 01:52:14,333
Let me go.

1712
01:52:14,833 --> 01:52:16,041
I've not held you captive.

1713
01:52:16,958 --> 01:52:18,666
The same goes for everyone.

1714
01:52:18,750 --> 01:52:20,166
Those who want to leave can do so now.

1715
01:52:20,250 --> 01:52:23,208
Don't complain later
that Bansi is selfish.

1716
01:52:27,875 --> 01:52:28,958
Thank you.

1717
01:52:35,333 --> 01:52:36,750
I am not a deserter.

1718
01:52:39,375 --> 01:52:40,750
I will sit here.

1719
01:52:42,208 --> 01:52:43,333
Let the police come.

1720
01:52:47,250 --> 01:52:48,791
Shall I make a cup of tea?

1721
01:52:50,083 --> 01:52:51,583
With biscuits.

1722
01:53:01,250 --> 01:53:03,083
I had already told you, madam.

1723
01:53:03,833 --> 01:53:06,250
My name shouldn't come up,
nor will I come forward.

1724
01:53:08,833 --> 01:53:10,458
Why won't you come forward?

1725
01:53:13,458 --> 01:53:15,083
They are nasty people.

1726
01:53:16,958 --> 01:53:19,750
I don't want to be anywhere
near these people.

1727
01:53:21,458 --> 01:53:23,083
And what about those girls?

1728
01:53:24,708 --> 01:53:26,083
I've no association with them.

1729
01:53:27,625 --> 01:53:31,333
With the girls, who helped you flee?

1730
01:53:34,083 --> 01:53:36,083
If you hadn't fled,

1731
01:53:36,708 --> 01:53:39,375
then your life would've been
like those girls.

1732
01:53:40,833 --> 01:53:42,208
Do you understand?

1733
01:53:43,625 --> 01:53:47,000
Don't you understand how important it is
for them to be arrested?

1734
01:53:50,958 --> 01:53:52,916
If they aren't arrested, Sudha,

1735
01:53:53,958 --> 01:53:56,333
some other girls will fall prey to them.

1736
01:53:57,833 --> 01:54:00,000
Some other Sudha
will be appointed a cook there

1737
01:54:00,083 --> 01:54:02,375
and she might not be as lucky as you are.

1738
01:54:03,833 --> 01:54:05,958
She might not be able to escape!
Then what?

1739
01:54:07,208 --> 01:54:09,083
Those demons will devour her.

1740
01:54:16,833 --> 01:54:18,125
What do you think?

1741
01:54:20,833 --> 01:54:22,333
Didn't I have an opportunity

1742
01:54:24,583 --> 01:54:29,000
to forget everything
and live a life of comfort and peace?

1743
01:54:29,083 --> 01:54:30,208
I did!

1744
01:54:31,833 --> 01:54:35,208
I don't care
what goes on in anyone's life.

1745
01:54:35,708 --> 01:54:38,833
I don't care if someone's living or dead!

1746
01:54:39,458 --> 01:54:41,500
Was anyone asking me questions?

1747
01:54:41,583 --> 01:54:43,125
Was I answerable to someone

1748
01:54:43,208 --> 01:54:45,458
about what was going on
in the shelter home? I wasn't.

1749
01:54:48,333 --> 01:54:51,083
I'm only answerable to myself, Sudha.

1750
01:54:53,208 --> 01:54:55,708
If I start thinking like you,

1751
01:54:56,958 --> 01:54:58,583
then I'll never be able to sleep.

1752
01:55:00,708 --> 01:55:02,625
I won't be able to face my own conscience.

1753
01:55:04,083 --> 01:55:05,208
Look at me.

1754
01:55:06,791 --> 01:55:08,458
Am I fighting for my own rights?

1755
01:55:09,458 --> 01:55:13,333
I'm fighting for the rights
of little girls. Do you get me?

1756
01:55:14,708 --> 01:55:18,958
For those orphaned girls.

1757
01:55:20,583 --> 01:55:24,375
No one will ask them whether they're okay.

1758
01:55:26,625 --> 01:55:27,958
But you don't care.

1759
01:55:30,583 --> 01:55:31,791
I didn't either.

1760
01:55:33,250 --> 01:55:35,833
But sometimes, Sudha,

1761
01:55:36,958 --> 01:55:41,375
you should do something without a reason.

1762
01:55:42,708 --> 01:55:46,500
Especially when we can save
someone's life.

1763
01:55:49,083 --> 01:55:52,000
You can change the lives
of those girls, Sudha.

1764
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:56,583
But fine.

1765
01:55:58,833 --> 01:56:01,625
Just like the three monkeys of Gandhi,

1766
01:56:01,708 --> 01:56:04,875
you can keep your eyes,
ears and mouth covered.

1767
01:56:07,583 --> 01:56:08,666
Live for yourself.

1768
01:56:10,125 --> 01:56:11,208
Die for yourself.

1769
01:56:49,833 --> 01:56:51,458
It's like a dog chasing its own tail.

1770
01:56:59,208 --> 01:57:01,708
Let's go back to Patna.

1771
01:57:09,958 --> 01:57:11,375
Mr. Bhaskar.

1772
01:57:24,541 --> 01:57:27,041
<i>The Munawwarpur girls' shelter home
belongs to Bansi Sahu.</i>

1773
01:57:28,333 --> 01:57:30,916
<i>The girls living there are being abused.</i>

1774
01:57:32,250 --> 01:57:36,500
<i>Bansi Sahu himself abuses them
and makes others do so too.</i>

1775
01:57:38,208 --> 01:57:44,083
<i>The warden, Baby Rani,
doses the girls with sedatives.</i>

1776
01:57:44,583 --> 01:57:48,500
And then different people
rape the girls when they are asleep.

1777
01:57:50,083 --> 01:57:52,958
<i>Baby Rani tells the girls to sleep naked</i>

1778
01:57:53,625 --> 01:57:56,000
and lies down naked next to them.

1779
01:57:56,666 --> 01:58:00,750
<i>The staff, Sonu,
Baccha Babu, Mithilesh Sinha,</i>

1780
01:58:00,833 --> 01:58:03,041
<i>the doctor, and several other men</i>

1781
01:58:03,125 --> 01:58:06,625
<i>make the girls dance to vulgar songs
and show them porn films too.</i>

1782
01:58:11,458 --> 01:58:15,541
<i>The girls staying there said
that a few girls got pregnant</i>

1783
01:58:15,625 --> 01:58:17,458
<i>and were killed.</i>

1784
01:59:14,208 --> 01:59:15,666
GIRLS' SHELTER HOME, MUNAWWARPUR

1785
01:59:16,958 --> 01:59:18,541
{\an8}MUNAWWARPUR POLICE

1786
01:59:31,958 --> 01:59:38,875
<i>Where was...</i>

1787
01:59:40,875 --> 01:59:46,708
<i>My little sun hiding?</i>

1788
01:59:47,416 --> 01:59:54,416
<i>How did it rise today?</i>

1789
01:59:56,791 --> 01:59:59,791
<i>Why do we ignore</i>

1790
02:00:00,291 --> 02:00:03,750
<i>Things happening around us?</i>

1791
02:00:04,333 --> 02:00:11,166
<i>Carelessly, in our own selfish world?</i>

1792
02:00:12,500 --> 02:00:15,958
<i>Somewhere around us</i>

1793
02:00:16,041 --> 02:00:19,875
<i>There are lives</i>

1794
02:00:19,958 --> 02:00:26,583
<i>Living in complete darkness</i>

1795
02:00:27,791 --> 02:00:34,541
<i>We are responsible for their state</i>

1796
02:00:35,708 --> 02:00:42,208
<i>Now, it's our duty
To bring smiles on their faces</i>

1797
02:00:42,958 --> 02:00:46,333
<i>We too are...</i>

1798
02:00:46,416 --> 02:00:50,833
<i>We too are...</i>

1799
02:00:50,916 --> 02:00:57,583
<i>We too are responsible to some extent</i>

1800
02:00:58,791 --> 02:01:02,500
<i>You too</i>

1801
02:01:02,583 --> 02:01:06,458
<i>And we too are</i>

1802
02:01:06,541 --> 02:01:13,541
<i>Responsible to some extent</i>

1803
02:01:47,666 --> 02:01:51,833
<i>We either become</i>

1804
02:01:51,916 --> 02:01:55,166
<i>The voice of the crowd</i>

1805
02:01:55,250 --> 02:01:59,416
<i>Or remain tight-lipped</i>

1806
02:01:59,500 --> 02:02:03,583
<i>And fear of raising voice</i>

1807
02:02:03,666 --> 02:02:07,375
<i>We either become</i>

1808
02:02:07,458 --> 02:02:11,333
<i>The voice of the crowd</i>

1809
02:02:11,416 --> 02:02:17,708
<i>Or remain tight-lipped
And fear to raise voice</i>

1810
02:02:17,791 --> 02:02:21,333
<i>It's our responsibility</i>

1811
02:02:21,416 --> 02:02:25,708
<i>To speak the truth</i>

1812
02:02:25,791 --> 02:02:29,416
<i>We will speak</i>

1813
02:02:29,500 --> 02:02:33,208
<i>Fearlessly</i>

1814
02:02:33,291 --> 02:02:36,750
<i>We are...</i>

1815
02:02:36,833 --> 02:02:40,666
<i>We too are...</i>

1816
02:02:40,750 --> 02:02:43,541
<i>Responsible to some extent...</i>

1817
02:02:43,625 --> 02:02:49,041
Our government has always
propagated women's empowerment

1818
02:02:49,125 --> 02:02:50,625
and has always worked in this direction.

1819
02:02:50,708 --> 02:02:53,500
People are claiming that
the report arrived two months ago,

1820
02:02:53,583 --> 02:02:55,291
but the government was tight-lipped.

1821
02:02:55,375 --> 02:02:56,916
No action was taken.

1822
02:02:57,500 --> 02:02:59,541
People make all sorts of claims.

1823
02:02:59,625 --> 02:03:02,458
Why would I stay tight-lipped
when I ordered the investigation?

1824
02:03:02,541 --> 02:03:05,083
I took immediate action
as soon as I got the report.

1825
02:03:05,166 --> 02:03:07,291
The girls will first
be sent for a medical test

1826
02:03:07,375 --> 02:03:12,125
and then they will be handed
over to us within 24 hours.

1827
02:03:12,208 --> 02:03:13,375
Then we'll record their statement.

1828
02:03:14,083 --> 02:03:16,250
If the allegations turn out to be true,

1829
02:03:17,208 --> 02:03:19,708
then the law will take strict action.

1830
02:03:19,791 --> 02:03:21,708
- Understood?
- Yes.

1831
02:03:21,791 --> 02:03:24,791
As the chief minister of the state,
I assure you

1832
02:03:24,875 --> 02:03:29,791
that our Social Welfare Department
has been working efficiently

1833
02:03:29,875 --> 02:03:33,375
and will continue doing so
under the leadership of Rajni Singh.

1834
02:03:33,458 --> 02:03:37,083
- Ma'am!
- That's all!

1835
02:03:37,166 --> 02:03:40,666
Listen, this is the miracle of the system.

1836
02:03:40,750 --> 02:03:45,333
It takes time,
but all goes well in the end.

1837
02:03:48,208 --> 02:03:55,000
<i>There's a minor difference
Between right and wrong</i>

1838
02:03:56,333 --> 02:04:02,958
<i>It's the power that brings in attitude</i>

1839
02:04:03,916 --> 02:04:10,750
<i>You have lost all your dignity</i>

1840
02:04:11,541 --> 02:04:18,458
<i>Like a candle blown out
By a strong gust of wind</i>

1841
02:04:19,708 --> 02:04:26,708
<i>Look into the mirror for a while</i>

1842
02:04:27,625 --> 02:04:34,541
<i>Is humanity alive in you?</i>

1843
02:04:35,333 --> 02:04:41,916
<i>With wily smile
We shake off our responsibilities</i>

1844
02:04:43,416 --> 02:04:48,958
<i>Are we going to endure
The atrocities forever?</i>

1845
02:04:50,791 --> 02:04:54,458
<i>We too are...</i>

1846
02:04:54,541 --> 02:04:58,625
<i>We too are...</i>

1847
02:04:58,708 --> 02:05:02,458
<i>We too are responsible</i>

1848
02:05:02,541 --> 02:05:07,958
<i>To some extent</i>

1849
02:06:19,458 --> 02:06:20,375
Are you ready?

1850
02:06:30,208 --> 02:06:31,583
How does it matter?

1851
02:06:32,750 --> 02:06:34,166
Today, it happened in Munawwarpur.

1852
02:06:34,250 --> 02:06:35,708
Tomorrow, it will be some other place.

1853
02:06:36,750 --> 02:06:39,583
Some will be angry
and some will also feel bad.

1854
02:06:41,250 --> 02:06:46,000
Many will express their sympathy
on Twitter and Facebook with a hashtag.

1855
02:06:48,041 --> 02:06:50,458
Some will be political

1856
02:06:50,541 --> 02:06:55,041
and others will realize
when their kin is mistreated.

1857
02:06:56,833 --> 02:06:59,458
Whatever happens,
it doesn't make a difference

1858
02:06:59,541 --> 02:07:05,458
because this Facebook world
has made our emotions zero.

1859
02:07:05,541 --> 02:07:07,250
Do you know what zero means?

1860
02:07:10,708 --> 02:07:13,833
This news might be published
in the newspaper.

1861
02:07:14,583 --> 02:07:20,208
Or maybe some ad might take up this space.

1862
02:07:21,625 --> 02:07:25,500
Media will show you
only what gets them TRP.

1863
02:07:25,583 --> 02:07:28,375
A well-dressed anchor
will show you the recap

1864
02:07:28,458 --> 02:07:31,333
and concluding part of the story,
but the truth...

1865
02:07:31,958 --> 02:07:33,000
Can't say.

1866
02:07:35,208 --> 02:07:37,083
There are several things in our lives

1867
02:07:37,166 --> 02:07:40,250
that are much more important
than this news.

1868
02:07:40,333 --> 02:07:41,333
Of course, they are.

1869
02:07:42,500 --> 02:07:45,250
You see, we don't have time.

1870
02:07:45,333 --> 02:07:48,125
Rather than hearing
these girls' rape stories,

1871
02:07:48,208 --> 02:07:49,958
we would rather cover our ears.

1872
02:07:50,458 --> 02:07:51,708
You're right.

1873
02:07:52,375 --> 02:07:54,041
Cover your ears.
Why would you want to hear?

1874
02:07:54,125 --> 02:07:56,416
It will evoke your sympathy.

1875
02:07:56,500 --> 02:07:58,083
Don't let it wake up.

1876
02:07:59,458 --> 02:08:02,875
Stay where you are, like a zero.

1877
02:08:02,958 --> 02:08:04,208
Do you know what zero means?

1878
02:08:04,958 --> 02:08:06,166
You don't?

1879
02:08:06,250 --> 02:08:07,583
Then Google it.

1880
02:08:08,500 --> 02:08:12,541
Rather, listen to spicy, entertaining

1881
02:08:12,625 --> 02:08:16,083
and give high TRPs to the news channels.

1882
02:08:16,625 --> 02:08:17,625
Listen to that.

1883
02:08:20,833 --> 02:08:25,250
The girls who were raped
in Munawwarpur were orphans.

1884
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:29,791
They were so young

1885
02:08:29,875 --> 02:08:34,875
that maybe they didn't understand
what was happening to them.

1886
02:08:37,083 --> 02:08:39,083
You and I are lucky.

1887
02:08:39,958 --> 02:08:43,625
We can discuss
every little thing with our mom.

1888
02:08:43,708 --> 02:08:44,750
We can tell them.

1889
02:08:44,833 --> 02:08:47,000
But look at their luck.

1890
02:08:48,833 --> 02:08:53,583
Many of them have never
even seen their mom.

1891
02:08:54,666 --> 02:08:56,208
But how does that matter?

1892
02:08:57,541 --> 02:08:59,666
Today, it's one thing.
Tomorrow, it will be something else.

1893
02:09:01,333 --> 02:09:04,708
Don't think too much about it.

1894
02:09:05,708 --> 02:09:09,375
It will provoke your sympathy.

1895
02:09:09,458 --> 02:09:12,250
Don't let it wake up. Let it sleep.

1896
02:09:14,250 --> 02:09:17,666
But before I go,
I'm leaving a question for you.

1897
02:09:17,750 --> 02:09:20,208
Think about it if you like.
Otherwise, it doesn't matter.

1898
02:09:24,333 --> 02:09:27,583
Have you forgotten to feel sad for others?

1899
02:09:30,708 --> 02:09:33,958
Do you still consider yourself a human

1900
02:09:35,458 --> 02:09:39,000
or are you a predator?

1901
02:09:42,708 --> 02:09:48,833
This is Vaishali Singh with Cameraman
Bhaskar Sinha for Koshish News, Patna.

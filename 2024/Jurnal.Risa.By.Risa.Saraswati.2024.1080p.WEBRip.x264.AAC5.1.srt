3
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:42,666
<i>Some people say that</i>
<i>believing in supernatural creatures</i>

4
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,458
<i>is the manifestation of fear</i>

5
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:50,625
<i>experienced by the</i>
<i>social community involved.</i>

6
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:55,833
<i>The belief in</i>
<i>supernatural creatures' existence</i>

7
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,583
<i>has long been rooted in our culture.</i>

8
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:01,833
<i>In the villages,</i>

9
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:07,166
<i>we see the belief</i>
<i>is getting even stronger.</i>

10
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:11,416
Two years ago,
a team made a documentary film

11
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,250
about the existence
of supernatural creatures.

12
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:20,125
{\an8}Existentialism is a view that puts humans…

13
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:21,208
{\an8}ANTHROPOLOGIST OF
PEOPLE RELIGION AND CULTURE

14
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:24,708
{\an8}…in the center point of a relationship.

15
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:29,041
<i>To exist, humans must realize</i>

16
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:35,583
{\an8}<i>that there are no other creatures</i>
<i>that exists aside from themselves.</i>

17
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:41,250
All of us here are physically visible.

18
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:48,916
But that doesn't mean that the invisible
or the supernatural doesn't exist.

19
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:52,541
{\an8}<i>When we believe they exist,</i>

20
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:54,500
{\an8}<i>then they do exist.</i>

21
00:01:56,125 --> 00:02:01,000
{\an8}<i>The point is you can't say</i>
<i>something is wrong</i>

22
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:05,500
{\an8}just because it can't
currently be proven.

23
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,458
One of the sources was Risa Saraswati,
a famous indigo in Indonesia.

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,708
<i>Risa, we'll start the interview now.</i>

25
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:22,083
<i>- Okay.</i>
<i>- I will sit there.</i>

26
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,708
Direct your eyes towards me.

27
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:29,166
- Mic. Get ready.
- Ready.

28
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,458
My name is Risa Saraswati.

29
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:42,166
I'm a writer. I'm a band member.
I'm a content creator.

30
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,916
I'm a government employee.

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,916
And I can see ghosts.

32
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:55,083
<i>Aside from Peter, there are William,</i>
<i>Hans, Hendrick, Janshen and Marianne.</i>

33
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:58,291
<i>I was afraid of them at first.</i>

34
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:02,416
<i>But in time, I eventually started</i>
<i>to communicate with them</i>

35
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,000
<i>and wrote stories about them.</i>

36
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,416
<i>Many think I'm lying.</i>

37
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:17,291
But for me, their names
and their stories are very real.

38
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:20,333
<i>They don't care whether you believe</i>
<i>about them or not.</i>

39
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,000
<i>They only want to be heard,</i>

40
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,041
<i>not to be believed.</i>

41
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:30,083
There is one entity that really scared me.

42
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,208
I accidentally called upon it

43
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,708
<i>in a Jurnal Risa</i> podcast
on our YouTube channel.

44
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,666
What's its name?

45
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:43,625
No.

46
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:47,583
Never call that name,
or else it'll get angry.

47
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:51,458
It is best to not remember
and say its name ever again.

48
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:58,833
Almost all of my family members
have the ability to talk to ghosts.

49
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,541
That's why we made <i>Jurnal Risa.</i>

50
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,833
{\an8}11:20 AM
JURNAL RISA'S TEAM ARRIVED

51
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,708
{\an8}The journal is our process
to communicate with ghosts

52
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:11,875
and introduce what we can see.

53
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,708
This will be our ghost hunting place.

54
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,166
Great.

55
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,458
It's suitable.

56
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:19,916
- Nice.
- Yeah.

57
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,083
- Risa, sound check.
- Okay.

58
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,541
One, two, one. Good?

59
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,041
- Okay. Come on.
- Okay.

60
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:36,333
Peace be upon you. Welcome to <i>Jurnal Risa.</i>

61
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:40,375
Today we're going to do a search
just outside Bandung,

62
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,041
in the Subang area.

63
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:46,250
I won't say the exact location,
but I'm not here alone.

64
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,708
I'm with <i>Jurnal Risa's</i> team.

65
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,666
Here's Dimasta.

66
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,416
Here's Nicko.

67
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,916
Indy.

68
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,916
And there's Kakang.

69
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,125
There's Riri who came all the way
from Jakarta. And also Fahrul.

70
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:03,916
And there are two masters,

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Angga and Jeffry,
who will do the cleansing

72
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,291
during the hunt to protect us.

73
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,750
- Right.
- Okay.

74
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,208
- Great. Ready?
- Ready.

75
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,708
{\an8}Risa, here are our
brave test participants.

76
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:19,791
{\an8}Hi!

77
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:20,875
{\an8}BRAVE TEST PARTICIPANTS ARRIVED

78
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,208
{\an8}- Hello.
- Hello.

79
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:23,875
- This is Ardi.
- Hi.

80
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,125
- Hello.
- Risa.

81
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,208
- This is Felly.
- Hello.

82
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:30,083
- Prisa.
- Prinsa.

83
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,541
My bad.

84
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,416
Thank God everyone's here.

85
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,583
Now, before we start the hunt,
let's pray first.

86
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,291
- Angga will lead the prayer.
- Okay.

87
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,166
Okay, before we start,

88
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,458
let's pray first,
so everything goes smoothly.

89
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,541
- Amen.
- Let's start our prayers.

90
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,333
Amen.

91
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,958
As usual, before we start…

92
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,875
- Come on, Ko.
- Iko.

93
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,250
Let's go.

94
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,333
For <i>Jurnal Risa,</i>
our nation, and our country.

95
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,708
Come on. Okay.

96
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:09,833
Great.

97
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,750
- Hello.
- Hello.

98
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:14,583
Is this the first time
you have joined <i>Jurnal Risa's</i> team?

99
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:15,958
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

100
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,916
If I may know, why did you join?

101
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,625
For me, it's really interesting.

102
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:22,125
And I'm also a big fan of Risa.

103
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:25,750
I'm curious what it will be like
to meet them.

104
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,250
What about you, Prisna?

105
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,875
Why did I join this?

106
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:34,208
By the way, before I answer you,
my name is Prinsa.

107
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,708
- Not Prisna.
- Right. Sorry.

108
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:39,375
People always mistake my name.

109
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:44,500
But everyone remembers the names
of the ghosts that Risa has met.

110
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:48,833
There's even a ghost whose name
can't be mentioned, but everyone knows it.

111
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:52,291
So maybe, by joining this,

112
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,958
I can be more popular
than the supernatural.

113
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,166
It's only a rat.

114
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,500
It's drizzling. Let's move.

115
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,833
- Let's move. It's drizzling.
- Move over there.

116
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,000
{\an8}09:00 PM
THE SEARCHING

117
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:12,416
{\an8}Okay, now's the right time
to do the search.

118
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,166
It's nightfall, a suitable time.

119
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,416
But there are too many people here.

120
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,458
So we're going to split into three teams.

121
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,750
Have you started to feel dizzy?

122
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,541
- What?
- Starting to feel dizzy.

123
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:23,666
I feel that.

124
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,333
Especially because
this structure is very old.

125
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,125
Don't embrace him.

126
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,625
What do you feel here?

127
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:39,541
You are brave.

128
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,375
See?

129
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,166
Did you hear that?

130
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,291
No.

131
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:52,541
Seriously. Just now… Did you hear it?

132
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:55,166
- No.
- This sound.

133
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,375
Why are you taking us here?

134
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,791
I think there's an entity

135
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:04,708
that's pulling me to come here.

136
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,500
Not too deep.

137
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:08,791
Hang on.

138
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,333
What are you feeling, Indy?

139
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,416
- I want to cry.
- Come here, Ko.

140
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,166
I want to cry. Oh, God.

141
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,125
You see that?

142
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:26,958
Why are there so many women here?

143
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,125
I can't stand it.

144
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,708
How curious are you?

145
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:38,666
Pretty curious.
Because I've never seen them.

146
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,083
- You want to see them?
- Yes.

147
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,166
Maybe…

148
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:44,458
Oh, dear.

149
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,333
As…

150
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,458
Up there.

151
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,250
This is not right.

152
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,625
Let's cast it out.

153
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,083
We can't talk to it anyway.

154
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,375
Miss.

155
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:07,208
- Sorry.
- Let me move to the side. I'm scared.

156
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:16,666
Not here. Please. There are a lot of them.

157
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,083
We only just started.

158
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,333
They're watching us. Really.

159
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,125
Over there, okay?

160
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,250
Okay.

161
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:25,750
I'm scared.

162
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:36,833
Okay, Fel. We're going to leave you here
to test your courage.

163
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:40,333
We've put two cameras,
up there and down there.

164
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:43,500
There are cameras over there
and over there.

165
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,375
You can see a camera here.

166
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,958
There's also a camera there.

167
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:52,916
These two cameras
will record all your activities.

168
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,833
So you can communicate what you hear,
what you see and what you feel.

169
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:01,125
If something happens,
if you can't bear it, just clap like this.

170
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,166
- Okay.
- And we'll come get you.

171
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,125
- Okay.
- Ready?

172
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,333
God willing.

173
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,125
- We'll leave you, okay?
- Okay.

174
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,958
Can you see that?

175
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,500
It's dark.

176
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,208
I'll try exploring this place.

177
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,000
Excuse me.

178
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,541
Okay.

179
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,000
Let's play, guys.

180
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:32,958
Okay, guys.

181
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,125
Excuse me.

182
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,125
So, this is the structure that…

183
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,416
Wow!

184
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,958
Hi, guys.

185
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,166
I'm doing the courage test here.

186
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:11,000
<i>I…</i>

187
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:21,000
<i>Now…</i>

188
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:33,291
<i>Own a doll</i>

189
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,500
Prins?

190
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,250
<i>Can't imagine…</i>

191
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,583
Prinsa, stop singing.

192
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,500
<i>How nice…</i>

193
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:49,083
<i>And cute…</i>

194
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:50,333
Hello?

195
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,125
Peter?

196
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,458
She's calling for Peter and friends.

197
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,500
- It's moving.
<i>- Hans?</i>

198
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,458
- Is her phone on low battery?
<i>- Hendrick?</i>

199
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,333
Asih?

200
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,750
Why aren't they coming?

201
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,000
Or…

202
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,208
Should I call

203
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:25,208
the one whose name must not be spoken?

204
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,583
Maybe it'll come.

205
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,666
<i>Samex?</i>

206
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,541
<i>Samex.</i>

207
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,083
Samex.

208
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,375
Maybe I should call on it faster. Okay.

209
00:13:56,708 --> 00:14:00,791
Samex.

210
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,041
Samex.

211
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:35,583
Check on her.

212
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,791
Come here.

213
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,125
Prinsa.

214
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,416
She's possessed.

215
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,708
Come on.

216
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:49,708
Seek God's forgiveness.

217
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,708
Prinsa, seek forgiveness from God.

218
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,875
- Stand up.
- Come on, seek God's forgiveness.

219
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,208
What's going on?

220
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,458
- She's possessed.
- What's going on?

221
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:00,666
She's possessed.

222
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,333
Oh, God.

223
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,000
Not here.

224
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,458
I think that's enough for now.

225
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,125
- Let's go back.
- Okay.

226
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,333
Okay then. Let's wrap this up.

227
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,291
Let's pack everything up. Come on.

228
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,208
Come on.

229
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,166
<i>Maybe I should call on it faster. Okay.</i>

230
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,291
<i>Samex.</i>

231
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,416
Was Samex the one trending on Twitter?

232
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Don't say its name.

233
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,666
Never.

234
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,375
I think Prinsa said
that name deliberately.

235
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:56,250
When this was viral back then,

236
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:59,791
people felt that the entity came to them.

237
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:03,666
But is it possible it came to Prinsa?

238
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:05,791
Check on it, Kang.

239
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:06,916
Play it.

240
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:13,875
It's…

241
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,750
{\an8}<i>Should I call</i>

242
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,875
{\an8}<i>the one whose name must not be spoken?</i>

243
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:20,875
{\an8}BRAVE TEST PARTICIPANT
EXPERIENCED SUPERNATURAL

244
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,000
{\an8}<i>Let me try.</i>

245
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:26,916
{\an8}<i>Samex.</i>

246
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,291
{\an8}<i>Samex.</i>

247
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:52,000
The documentary team agreed
to follow Prinsa's daily activities

248
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:55,208
to know her development.

249
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,375
- Can I have a kilo of this?
- Okay.

250
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:16,416
You're the girl from that viral video,
aren't you?

251
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,916
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

252
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:26,083
<i>Someone from</i> Jurnal Risa's <i>team</i>
<i>had gone to Prinsa's house.</i>

253
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:28,958
She needs to be checked on.

254
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,750
I'm afraid something has latched onto her.

255
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,958
What do you mean by "something"?

256
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,083
Uwa Satirah.

257
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,166
One of our distant relatives.

258
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:42,125
{\an8}She got that name
when she started to haunt our family.

259
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,625
{\an8}PRINSA MANDAGIE'S HOUSE.

260
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,750
{\an8}The people from her village
gave that name.

261
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,958
According to my father,

262
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:52,250
if someone
doesn't cast her out in five days,

263
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,750
the soul from the body
she inhabits will be gone.

264
00:17:57,333 --> 00:18:00,333
I hope it's not Uwa
who has latched onto Prinsa.

265
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,208
Oh, God!

266
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:21,125
Hi!

267
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,875
Guys, guess who's here?

268
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,791
Angga and Indy are here.

269
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,125
Say hi.

270
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,666
Angga and Indy are in <i>Jurnal Risa's</i> team.

271
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,958
You remember that I had joined
the search the other day, don't you?

272
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,708
Come in.

273
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,666
So much fun!

274
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,208
<i>Jurnal Risa</i> comes over to the house now?

275
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,833
Bayu.

276
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:52,500
Angga, Indy, this is Bayu, my cousin.

277
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:57,750
He also handles all of my activities.

278
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,541
- Sa…
- Bayu.

279
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,541
<i>Jurnal Risa</i> is good for me. Okay?

280
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:04,750
Please.

281
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,875
I'm Angga.

282
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:12,750
Bayu.

283
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,083
- Indy.
- Bayu.

284
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:23,958
What's going on?

285
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,291
If I may ask,

286
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:33,041
after the courage test,
did you experience anything strange?

287
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,791
No. Everything's normal.

288
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:37,916
Right?

289
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,500
Okay, Prinsa.

290
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,250
After the courage test,

291
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,583
the video went viral.

292
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,958
But <i>Jurnal Risa's</i> team

293
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:55,666
feels that something has latched onto you.

294
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,333
And we came here

295
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,000
to do a cleansing ritual on you.

296
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:04,041
Allow us to do it, please.

297
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,125
Okay.

298
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,000
Where is she going?

299
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,875
Wait, Riri?

300
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:48,916
Riri?

301
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,291
Brother?

302
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:57,958
Brother?

303
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,291
Indy?

304
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,750
Indy!

305
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:05,916
Help!

306
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:12,583
Uwa.

307
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:13,708
Uwa?

308
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,000
Sit down.

309
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:23,708
Sit down.

310
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,791
Sa?

311
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,083
Sa?

312
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:55,750
Prinsa?

313
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,833
I think that was Uwa.

314
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:04,166
Uwa likes to come
in the form of people that we know.

315
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:08,375
I thought it was Riri.

316
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:10,416
But…

317
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,375
{\an8}The documentary team was allowed
to put cameras inside Prinsa's house.

318
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:23,875
Like this?

319
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:25,333
Yes.

320
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:27,083
How's it? Check the battery.

321
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:16,083
What's that?

322
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,625
What are you doing?

323
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:23,500
Prinsa?

324
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:26,333
What's going on?

325
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:30,125
What happened?

326
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:32,166
There was…

327
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,916
Guys, today I've been invited
to a content creator's podcast.

328
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,458
I've never been invited to
something like this.

329
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:53,708
This is the first time I've been invited
to someone's podcast.

330
00:24:53,791 --> 00:24:56,000
During my five years doing YouTube videos,

331
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:59,041
people have never been
this interested in me.

332
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:02,541
I don't know if I'm too ordinary or what.

333
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:05,125
One thing is for sure, I'm very nervous.

334
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:09,666
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

335
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:15,000
- We're leaving.
- Okay.

336
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:20,500
- Do you see it?
- It's over there. Over there.

337
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:23,500
You sit there, the guest sits here.

338
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:25,416
The second one…

339
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,291
Mi. This is Prisna.

340
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:30,375
- Let her sit there.
- Thanks.

341
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:33,208
When it's done, please take it off…

342
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,708
Sit here.

343
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:37,083
Thanks.

344
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:42,000
Let's start.

345
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:44,625
Hi, guys. Back with me, Mimi,

346
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:46,875
in <i>When Someone In Love With</i> podcast.

347
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:53,041
Prinsa got angry during the podcast.

348
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:55,166
Bayu called.

349
00:25:55,541 --> 00:25:56,750
She got angry?

350
00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:09,333
Sa.

351
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:12,041
We need to do the cleansing again.

352
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:17,000
Why do I need to be cleansed again?

353
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:23,583
I'm still Prinsa!

354
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:26,416
- We're only afraid that it's…
- Samex?

355
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:28,666
You mean Samex?

356
00:26:33,958 --> 00:26:35,000
Sa…

357
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:42,583
Di…

358
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:45,083
Let her go. Stay here.

359
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:38,750
Prinsa?

360
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:40,000
Prinsa!

361
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,958
- Prinsa's not here.
- Not here?

362
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:45,166
And she's not outside.

363
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,666
- Sa?
- Sa?

364
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:48,333
Sa?

365
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,041
- Prinsa?
- I'll check one more time.

366
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:52,291
- Sa?
- Sa?

367
00:27:52,375 --> 00:27:53,666
Prinsa?

368
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:57,708
She's not here.

369
00:27:58,333 --> 00:27:59,416
Sa?

370
00:27:59,916 --> 00:28:01,333
- Can't find her?
- No.

371
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,500
Prinsa?

372
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:06,833
It's from the surveillance camera.

373
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:30,916
Hello.

374
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,750
<i>Hello. I'm Fras from</i>
<i>Dreamland studio management.</i>

375
00:28:33,833 --> 00:28:37,083
<i>Is this Bayu,</i>
<i>Prinsa Mandagie's contact person?</i>

376
00:28:37,166 --> 00:28:39,791
<i>She is scheduled</i>
<i>to do a photoshoot this morning?</i>

377
00:28:40,875 --> 00:28:43,041
Right, that's me.

378
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:45,875
Is it today, at 9:00 a.m.?

379
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:51,833
But, I'm so sorry,
I think we have to cancel it.

380
00:28:51,916 --> 00:28:53,000
- Because…
<i>- Listen.</i>

381
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:55,000
<i>Something happened last night.</i>

382
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:57,250
<i>You better come to the studio right now.</i>

383
00:28:57,333 --> 00:28:58,625
<i>It's about Prinsa.</i>

384
00:28:58,708 --> 00:29:00,333
<i>We'll be waiting.</i>
<i>Come here asap.</i>

385
00:29:00,416 --> 00:29:01,458
<i>Thanks.</i>

386
00:29:01,541 --> 00:29:02,625
Bay?

387
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:04,708
Here.

388
00:29:04,791 --> 00:29:05,875
Prinsa?

389
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,041
Pri…

390
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:11,208
- Her clothes.
- Oh, God! Prinsa!

391
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,583
Hang on. Don't come here. Wait!

392
00:29:13,666 --> 00:29:15,875
Prinsa. Oh, God.

393
00:29:15,958 --> 00:29:17,125
Oh, dear.

394
00:29:19,541 --> 00:29:20,708
Sit here.

395
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:28,000
Sa…

396
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:29,458
Where am I?

397
00:29:29,958 --> 00:29:32,625
Bayu, what happened to me?

398
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:36,875
Why am I here?

399
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:51,250
Here it is.

400
00:30:07,708 --> 00:30:09,708
Am I the only one who has seen this video?

401
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:11,375
We, the documentary team,

402
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:13,791
didn't have the heart
to show this video to Bayu.

403
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:16,750
This is from last night.

404
00:30:22,291 --> 00:30:23,583
What do you think?

405
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:28,458
Is she possessed by
Grandma Satirah or Samex?

406
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:48,000
Uwa Satirah was
a distant relative of our family.

407
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:51,791
She was our late grandma's best friend.

408
00:30:52,666 --> 00:30:55,625
<i>Angga and I were kids back then.</i>

409
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:59,166
<i>She lived a life far away from religion.</i>

410
00:31:00,416 --> 00:31:03,458
<i>Our late grandma</i>
<i>once gave her a prayer clothing.</i>

411
00:31:03,541 --> 00:31:05,291
<i>She rejected it.</i>

412
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:08,250
Not long after that…

413
00:31:09,625 --> 00:31:11,000
she passed away.

414
00:31:12,541 --> 00:31:16,583
Since then,
her spirit started to haunt our family.

415
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:21,666
<i>Our father and our grandpa</i>
<i>tried to tie her</i>

416
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:24,666
<i>with the help of someone from her village.</i>

417
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:26,375
Since then…

418
00:31:28,041 --> 00:31:30,250
her name was changed to Samex.

419
00:31:31,791 --> 00:31:34,541
Prinsa mentioned her name
during the shooting.

420
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:38,833
Son, be safe!

421
00:31:40,958 --> 00:31:43,000
Just like most people,

422
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:46,041
Prinsa must have been
curious about that entity.

423
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:49,041
But she didn't know
what the consequences of her actions.

424
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:52,250
You're already home? That's Mom.

425
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,333
What's going on?

426
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:03,875
Nothing.

427
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,791
Let's not discuss this anymore.

428
00:32:28,916 --> 00:32:30,666
Why are you recording like that?

429
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:34,916
The documentary team asked me to do this,
just in case.

430
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,916
What happened this afternoon?

431
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,666
I think something wrong is happening.

432
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:45,375
Hey. What's wrong with your hand?
Why do you keep on scratching it?

433
00:32:45,458 --> 00:32:47,416
Forget it. Let's just sleep.

434
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,541
Okay.

435
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:50,375
Ri, son.

436
00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:52,166
Wait.

437
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,750
- Ari? Where is he?
- He was just there.

438
00:32:54,833 --> 00:32:55,958
Ri?

439
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:57,291
- Ari?
- Ari?

440
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:58,833
Let me check on him.

441
00:32:58,916 --> 00:33:00,083
Ri?

442
00:33:00,166 --> 00:33:01,958
Ari is sleeping in his room.

443
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,541
Wait.

444
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:06,583
Let's check on him. Ari?

445
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:18,208
Ari?

446
00:33:18,291 --> 00:33:21,416
How is he here? Wasn't he in our room?

447
00:33:22,541 --> 00:33:23,708
Nevermind.

448
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:26,333
It's better if he sleeps in our room.

449
00:33:26,416 --> 00:33:28,000
He has a fever.

450
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:30,458
Come on.

451
00:33:33,416 --> 00:33:34,458
Hey.

452
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,125
Ari's condition is better.

453
00:33:38,208 --> 00:33:39,875
His fever has gone down.

454
00:33:39,958 --> 00:33:41,666
The doctor said he's fine.

455
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,375
Okay? Don't be sad.

456
00:33:44,583 --> 00:33:45,708
Calm down.

457
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:48,583
I'm going to be with him.

458
00:33:49,083 --> 00:33:50,125
Okay.

459
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:57,750
We need to meet Dad.
We have to talk to him.

460
00:33:57,833 --> 00:33:58,875
Okay.

461
00:33:58,958 --> 00:34:00,375
Calm down.

462
00:34:00,458 --> 00:34:02,333
Let us take care of this.

463
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:04,000
You just focus on Ari.

464
00:34:10,791 --> 00:34:16,500
She accidentally mentioned
Uwa's name on YouTube.

465
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:19,250
How could she be so careless?

466
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:23,291
You all know the consequences.

467
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:46,416
Sa. Prinsa.

468
00:34:48,041 --> 00:34:50,666
- Go say your prayers.
- Yeah, later.

469
00:34:51,208 --> 00:34:52,333
Later.

470
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,291
So that you get some peace

471
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:00,916
and you're not disturbed anymore.

472
00:35:02,666 --> 00:35:03,708
Okay?

473
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:06,208
I will say my prayers too after this.

474
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:28,375
Thank you for giving me this.

475
00:35:32,083 --> 00:35:34,208
But I will not wear it.

476
00:35:36,958 --> 00:35:38,916
You can go to heaven by yourself.

477
00:35:42,416 --> 00:35:44,708
I'll stay in a huge rice field.

478
00:35:54,875 --> 00:35:57,416
They kept on doing
the cleansing ritual on Prinsa

479
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,041
and the process was
monitored and recorded.

480
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:21,875
This is day three.

481
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:26,708
And I'm really exhausted.

482
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:30,708
Going through the
cleansing ritual repeatedly.

483
00:36:33,208 --> 00:36:36,083
I kept on going through situations

484
00:36:36,166 --> 00:36:38,250
where I wasn't aware of
what was happening.

485
00:36:40,416 --> 00:36:43,750
So, I'm going to take precautions tonight.

486
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:15,625
- Indy.
- Yes?

487
00:37:17,708 --> 00:37:19,416
Aren't you scared

488
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:22,875
having to live this every day?

489
00:37:22,958 --> 00:37:24,875
Sometimes, yes, I'm scared.

490
00:37:24,958 --> 00:37:27,125
But we have the others here.

491
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:28,375
So, we're safe.

492
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:37,250
I only have Bayu.

493
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:41,333
Earlier…

494
00:37:42,833 --> 00:37:44,291
I was only by myself.

495
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,333
I have a question.

496
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:02,291
Do you have a best friend?

497
00:38:03,416 --> 00:38:07,208
Nicko is my big brother
and my best friend.

498
00:38:08,208 --> 00:38:11,375
Everyone in the <i>Jurnal Risa</i> team
are also my friends.

499
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:12,625
What about you?

500
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:17,916
Earlier, I had one.

501
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:20,125
A long time ago.

502
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:23,541
We were best friends.

503
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:25,416
There were four of us.

504
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:30,750
Two of them went to the city
with their parents.

505
00:38:31,708 --> 00:38:33,458
There were two left.

506
00:38:35,625 --> 00:38:37,666
But they're not together anymore now.

507
00:38:41,208 --> 00:38:44,041
One killed herself.

508
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:49,041
One died and never once said her prayers.

509
00:39:03,166 --> 00:39:07,916
Why are you calling her Aunty,
and not Samex?

510
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,125
Di.

511
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,583
Where's Prinsa?

512
00:40:56,666 --> 00:40:58,000
It's not Prinsa.

513
00:40:58,083 --> 00:41:01,083
Uwa is here. Be careful.

514
00:41:02,291 --> 00:41:03,458
Prinsa?

515
00:41:06,125 --> 00:41:08,875
100 bodies, 200 bodies, 300 bodies…

516
00:41:12,583 --> 00:41:14,708
Slowly, Bay.

517
00:41:14,791 --> 00:41:17,791
Prinsa.

518
00:41:18,833 --> 00:41:20,500
Prinsa.

519
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:22,125
Prinsa, wake up.

520
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,166
- Bay.
- Yes?

521
00:41:53,458 --> 00:41:54,541
Who is it?

522
00:41:57,083 --> 00:41:58,458
Have her sit over here.

523
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:05,083
Aceng…

524
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:10,416
Why are you disturbing Prinsa?

525
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,291
What do you want?

526
00:42:12,958 --> 00:42:15,125
I'm not disturbing her.

527
00:42:16,041 --> 00:42:17,541
I was called upon.

528
00:42:18,916 --> 00:42:21,375
Come on, hurry and go home.

529
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:24,708
Go home.

530
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,583
Hold her, Bay.

531
00:42:28,666 --> 00:42:30,250
No way.

532
00:42:30,333 --> 00:42:32,291
I don't want to be tied again.

533
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:35,458
In the name of God.

534
00:42:36,125 --> 00:42:39,916
"There's no god worthy of worship except
Him, the Ever-Living, All-Sustaining."

535
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,416
It's hot!

536
00:42:52,916 --> 00:42:54,791
Wake up, Sa.

537
00:42:54,875 --> 00:42:56,291
Bay.

538
00:42:56,375 --> 00:42:57,958
I can't!

539
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:05,833
Be careful, Bay.

540
00:43:07,833 --> 00:43:08,958
Watch out, Ko.

541
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,125
Oh, God.

542
00:43:17,625 --> 00:43:19,500
Don't stand there.

543
00:43:57,666 --> 00:43:59,125
Hold her!

544
00:44:04,625 --> 00:44:06,458
Uwa.

545
00:44:06,541 --> 00:44:09,291
Stop it, Uwa, possess me instead.

546
00:44:09,375 --> 00:44:11,250
No!

547
00:44:12,708 --> 00:44:14,375
Move.

548
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,458
Is she awake?

549
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:31,958
Move her to a chair.

550
00:44:37,958 --> 00:44:39,041
Prinsa.

551
00:44:54,083 --> 00:44:57,250
I don't think it's Uwa.

552
00:44:59,291 --> 00:45:01,583
I think it's something supernatural

553
00:45:01,666 --> 00:45:03,166
in the form of Uwa.

554
00:45:06,333 --> 00:45:07,791
Hurry.

555
00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:10,333
Go back to the village where it came from.

556
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,833
Only they can bind her.

557
00:45:12,916 --> 00:45:16,166
They're the ones who helped
bind Uwa back then.

558
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,458
They're also the ones

559
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:20,750
who gave her the name Samex.

560
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:26,291
<i>It's getting dangerous for Prinsa.</i>

561
00:45:26,375 --> 00:45:29,500
<i>According to Dad,</i>
<i>the only way to solve this</i>

562
00:45:29,583 --> 00:45:34,833
<i>is by taking Prinsa</i>
<i>to Uwa's home village.</i>

563
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:37,833
<i>Anything can happen there.</i>

564
00:45:37,916 --> 00:45:40,541
<i>But they have to be able to face it.</i>

565
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,125
<i>Or else,</i>

566
00:45:42,625 --> 00:45:45,625
<i>Prinsa…</i>

567
00:45:47,125 --> 00:45:50,041
may never come back, ever.

568
00:45:58,875 --> 00:46:01,875
Where are you taking me?

569
00:46:06,958 --> 00:46:09,625
If you think

570
00:46:10,083 --> 00:46:14,208
I'll be scared to be taken back
to the place where I was born…

571
00:46:17,583 --> 00:46:19,291
You're wrong.

572
00:46:47,958 --> 00:46:49,083
Come on, Sa.

573
00:46:52,375 --> 00:46:53,541
Slowly.

574
00:47:42,958 --> 00:47:43,875
Is that…

575
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:45,875
empty?

576
00:48:30,666 --> 00:48:31,916
Who are they?

577
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,250
They're from the city.

578
00:48:33,416 --> 00:48:34,791
What are they doing here?

579
00:48:34,875 --> 00:48:36,000
What's wrong with him?

580
00:48:41,333 --> 00:48:42,666
What's the matter?

581
00:48:44,458 --> 00:48:46,250
Leave. Get out of here.

582
00:48:46,333 --> 00:48:47,791
Just go home, all of you!

583
00:48:47,875 --> 00:48:49,250
Go back!

584
00:48:49,333 --> 00:48:50,875
Go home! All of you!

585
00:48:51,125 --> 00:48:53,833
Brother, what's going on here?

586
00:48:53,916 --> 00:48:54,958
Sir, ma'am.

587
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,625
We're here to meet the village head.

588
00:49:19,708 --> 00:49:23,083
Are you his guest?

589
00:49:23,166 --> 00:49:24,333
Yes.

590
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:28,541
Come with me.

591
00:50:08,083 --> 00:50:09,000
Excuse me, sir.

592
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,875
For the earth, for water,

593
00:50:14,958 --> 00:50:16,166
100 bodies,

594
00:50:17,291 --> 00:50:18,750
200 bodies.

595
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:26,708
For the earth, for water,

596
00:50:27,583 --> 00:50:29,083
100 bodies,

597
00:50:29,666 --> 00:50:30,916
200 bodies.

598
00:50:32,666 --> 00:50:34,958
What is this blood and mat for?

599
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,041
The mat is…

600
00:50:39,416 --> 00:50:42,458
for the ritual.

601
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:45,875
So no one will die anymore.

602
00:50:45,958 --> 00:50:47,500
People died?

603
00:50:53,416 --> 00:50:55,041
It's been a few days.

604
00:50:57,541 --> 00:51:00,875
There have been lots of signs
that don't make sense.

605
00:51:03,541 --> 00:51:06,541
Something strange is going to happen.

606
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,166
Can we meet the village head now?

607
00:51:37,458 --> 00:51:38,416
Come on.

608
00:51:39,041 --> 00:51:40,750
Come on, Bay.

609
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:58,958
Nobody from the village

610
00:51:59,708 --> 00:52:02,291
dares to stay here.

611
00:52:10,625 --> 00:52:12,416
They're all afraid.

612
00:52:13,583 --> 00:52:17,041
This is Satirah's house.

613
00:52:18,166 --> 00:52:19,791
We have arrived.

614
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:21,291
Be careful.

615
00:52:29,666 --> 00:52:30,708
We're here.

616
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:41,333
All of you, don't go in for now.

617
00:52:41,416 --> 00:52:44,125
I'm going to clean it first.

618
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:45,250
Come on, Arja.

619
00:52:57,208 --> 00:52:58,500
She has come back.

620
00:52:58,583 --> 00:53:00,500
- Excuse me.
- Please come in.

621
00:53:02,166 --> 00:53:04,583
I am the eldest here.

622
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,541
Are you all Aceng's grandkids?

623
00:53:09,625 --> 00:53:10,666
Yes.

624
00:53:21,208 --> 00:53:23,416
It's the fifth night, isn't it?

625
00:53:26,375 --> 00:53:27,458
Get me a chair.

626
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,416
Put it here.

627
00:53:36,625 --> 00:53:37,666
Let her sit.

628
00:53:39,541 --> 00:53:42,416
Excuse me.
What are you doing to my cousin?

629
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,958
Bay, remember what Risa said.
Just listen to him.

630
00:53:45,041 --> 00:53:46,916
- It's Prinsa.
- It's for her own good.

631
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,666
- Do what he says. They know.
- Yes.

632
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:49,791
Come on.

633
00:53:49,875 --> 00:53:51,166
Please help.

634
00:53:57,083 --> 00:54:02,333
100 bodies, 200 bodies, 300 bodies.

635
00:54:06,583 --> 00:54:10,750
100 bodies, 200 bodies…

636
00:54:11,583 --> 00:54:13,625
300 bodies.

637
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:18,666
You've finally revealed yourself.

638
00:54:19,666 --> 00:54:21,166
Satirah.

639
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:22,666
Aki.

640
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:24,750
- Satirah.
- Aki.

641
00:54:24,833 --> 00:54:26,791
Father said it's not Uwa Satirah.

642
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:28,666
Who is this, then?

643
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:44,583
It's not only Satirah who is called
Samex in this village.

644
00:54:45,583 --> 00:54:49,416
Supernatural creatures,
from people who died in unnatural ways.

645
00:54:52,333 --> 00:54:54,625
- Ito.
- Yes, Aki.

646
00:55:07,708 --> 00:55:09,333
Not everyone can come in.

647
00:55:09,416 --> 00:55:10,875
Let's just stay here, Bay.

648
00:55:12,083 --> 00:55:13,583
Stay here.

649
00:55:13,666 --> 00:55:15,083
Calm down and stay here.

650
00:55:15,166 --> 00:55:16,916
Trust them. They know better.

651
00:55:17,666 --> 00:55:18,750
Okay?

652
00:55:42,208 --> 00:55:43,291
This is Uwa Satirah.

653
00:55:45,791 --> 00:55:48,000
This is Enok, our grandma.

654
00:55:49,291 --> 00:55:51,458
This is Mak Eya, Grandma's big sister.

655
00:55:52,625 --> 00:55:54,750
And this is Uwa Imas.

656
00:55:56,333 --> 00:55:58,666
I'm going to ask again.

657
00:56:00,791 --> 00:56:03,041
What are you doing here?

658
00:56:04,958 --> 00:56:08,750
Did you think I'd be scared to be brought
to my own village?

659
00:56:21,375 --> 00:56:26,125
<i>During the ritual,</i>
<i>the supernatural gate will open.</i>

660
00:56:26,375 --> 00:56:29,583
<i>When Samex comes out</i>
<i>of this woman's body,</i>

661
00:56:30,166 --> 00:56:32,791
she might not be the only one
who is going to get out.

662
00:56:33,291 --> 00:56:35,125
Lots of supernatural entities

663
00:56:35,208 --> 00:56:40,291
are looking for humans
as their dwelling place.

664
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:47,000
<i>This village has been</i>
<i>cursed for four years.</i>

665
00:56:47,083 --> 00:56:50,083
<i>And it has impacted</i>
<i>a lot of the villagers.</i>

666
00:56:50,708 --> 00:56:52,625
<i>And they died in unnatural ways.</i>

667
00:56:53,708 --> 00:56:56,125
Agricultural failure.

668
00:56:57,041 --> 00:56:59,208
Prolonged drought.

669
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:03,500
Some of them
who consistently haunt the villagers…

670
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:08,083
are called Samex.

671
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,625
That's what happened to Prinsa.

672
00:57:14,875 --> 00:57:17,416
Brother, what should we do?

673
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:18,625
Let's just stay here

674
00:57:18,708 --> 00:57:20,625
while waiting for their preparation.

675
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:22,583
Okay.

676
00:57:22,666 --> 00:57:25,833
Let Prinsa and Bayu
rest for tonight's ritual.

677
00:57:27,125 --> 00:57:28,166
Okay.

678
00:57:30,208 --> 00:57:31,708
Bridge…

679
00:57:33,166 --> 00:57:34,791
Ryan, let's go.

680
00:57:35,458 --> 00:57:37,583
Bayu, Ryan and I are heading out.

681
00:57:37,666 --> 00:57:40,000
We're going to see
the ritual preparations.

682
00:57:40,083 --> 00:57:41,416
- Okay?
- Sure.

683
00:57:44,083 --> 00:57:45,166
Offering.

684
00:57:46,166 --> 00:57:48,125
Bridge.

685
00:57:48,208 --> 00:57:50,166
- Sa…
- River.

686
00:57:50,791 --> 00:57:53,208
Hot.

687
00:57:53,291 --> 00:57:54,666
Let me help you.

688
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:56,125
Hot.

689
00:57:58,375 --> 00:57:59,416
Bridge.

690
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,875
- Sa…
- Offering.

691
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:05,166
Earth.

692
00:58:06,666 --> 00:58:07,750
Bridge.

693
00:58:08,333 --> 00:58:09,583
Don't disturb my cousin.

694
00:58:11,125 --> 00:58:12,583
Don't disturb my cousin.

695
00:58:14,083 --> 00:58:18,250
Bayu, this is me, Prinsa.

696
00:58:18,958 --> 00:58:21,875
I'm exhausted.

697
00:58:21,958 --> 00:58:24,458
I want to go home.

698
00:58:25,416 --> 00:58:28,291
- Sa…
- I want to go home.

699
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:30,083
Prinsa.

700
00:58:34,541 --> 00:58:39,041
I promise you, after you get better,
we're going to go home.

701
00:58:39,125 --> 00:58:40,166
What do you want?

702
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:42,250
I'm going to fulfill
whatever you ask for.

703
00:58:44,291 --> 00:58:48,583
I want to taste the placenta
of a newborn baby.

704
00:58:50,708 --> 00:58:53,708
I'll split it slowly.

705
00:58:55,041 --> 00:58:56,416
Its heart…

706
00:58:57,416 --> 00:58:59,500
Or its organs.

707
00:59:01,125 --> 00:59:02,166
Sa.

708
00:59:03,291 --> 00:59:09,541
I'll always remember how good it tastes.

709
00:59:18,083 --> 00:59:19,333
Sa…

710
00:59:19,416 --> 00:59:20,875
Turn on the lights.

711
00:59:23,333 --> 00:59:24,541
Where is she?

712
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:26,541
Where's Prinsa?

713
00:59:29,208 --> 00:59:30,083
Prinsa?

714
00:59:30,583 --> 00:59:32,083
Try looking for her over there.

715
00:59:32,958 --> 00:59:34,041
Sa?

716
00:59:34,125 --> 00:59:35,291
She's not here.

717
00:59:35,916 --> 00:59:37,041
Prinsa!

718
00:59:42,666 --> 00:59:44,000
- What?
- There's something…

719
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,041
Prinsa's not here. Let's look over there.

720
00:59:48,208 --> 00:59:49,375
Shit.

721
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:51,958
Prinsa.

722
00:59:55,666 --> 00:59:56,708
Sa?

723
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:03,791
Sa?

724
01:00:08,833 --> 01:00:09,875
Sa?

725
01:00:10,666 --> 01:00:11,916
Prinsa?

726
01:00:15,416 --> 01:00:16,500
Prinsa?

727
01:00:20,791 --> 01:00:22,000
Prinsa?

728
01:00:26,541 --> 01:00:28,041
Where are we?

729
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:29,625
Where are we?

730
01:00:31,708 --> 01:00:33,500
Rik, let's go back.

731
01:00:37,083 --> 01:00:38,708
Bayu.

732
01:00:38,791 --> 01:00:40,166
It's locked.

733
01:00:48,833 --> 01:00:50,125
It's Prinsa's voice.

734
01:00:50,833 --> 01:00:51,916
Sa?

735
01:00:53,708 --> 01:00:54,833
Prinsa?

736
01:01:07,875 --> 01:01:08,958
Bay?

737
01:01:09,458 --> 01:01:10,541
Bayu?

738
01:01:12,166 --> 01:01:13,708
Bay? Bayu?

739
01:01:32,125 --> 01:01:33,166
Bay?

740
01:01:33,833 --> 01:01:34,958
Bayu?

741
01:02:13,375 --> 01:02:14,958
Bay? Bayu?

742
01:02:15,541 --> 01:02:16,791
Bayu?

743
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:50,833
Bay.

744
01:02:51,416 --> 01:02:53,041
We're back at this house.

745
01:03:01,625 --> 01:03:02,875
Bay.

746
01:03:03,625 --> 01:03:05,875
Don't go into that room.

747
01:03:11,041 --> 01:03:13,500
Let's try to go out the front door.

748
01:03:27,333 --> 01:03:28,583
The door's open!

749
01:03:31,083 --> 01:03:32,375
Pull it!

750
01:03:32,458 --> 01:03:33,541
I can't!

751
01:03:33,625 --> 01:03:35,041
Bay, pull it!

752
01:03:35,125 --> 01:03:37,083
I can't!

753
01:03:37,166 --> 01:03:38,666
The door opened!

754
01:03:44,541 --> 01:03:47,500
Ki! Aki!

755
01:03:52,458 --> 01:03:54,333
She took my child!

756
01:03:54,416 --> 01:03:55,541
My child is missing!

757
01:03:55,625 --> 01:03:58,166
Help, Ki! My child has been kidnapped!

758
01:03:58,250 --> 01:04:00,208
Calm down. Help them.

759
01:04:01,208 --> 01:04:02,875
Help us.

760
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,541
- Bayu?
- Bayu!

761
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:12,375
Help!

762
01:04:12,458 --> 01:04:13,500
Indy!

763
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:15,291
No, keep recording.

764
01:04:19,541 --> 01:04:21,750
- Calm down.
- Prinsa!

765
01:04:21,833 --> 01:04:24,375
Be careful. Sit down.

766
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,250
Are you okay?

767
01:04:27,333 --> 01:04:30,458
Bayu…

768
01:04:30,541 --> 01:04:31,708
What happened to Bayu?

769
01:04:32,958 --> 01:04:35,375
Prinsa's missing.

770
01:04:35,458 --> 01:04:37,375
- Help us!
- Prinsa's missing.

771
01:04:37,458 --> 01:04:39,000
Where did she go missing?

772
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:42,125
I don't know.

773
01:04:42,458 --> 01:04:45,125
- Wait here.
- I recorded Samex.

774
01:04:45,208 --> 01:04:46,375
- Samex?
- Yes.

775
01:04:46,458 --> 01:04:48,458
- Calm down.
- It was Samex.

776
01:04:48,541 --> 01:04:49,666
Samex.

777
01:04:50,708 --> 01:04:52,166
Samex.

778
01:04:53,375 --> 01:04:55,541
It hurts!

779
01:04:55,625 --> 01:04:56,916
Hurry.

780
01:05:01,333 --> 01:05:03,583
Before she gets to the rice field.

781
01:05:04,708 --> 01:05:07,291
Let's look for her along the way.

782
01:05:07,833 --> 01:05:10,250
Maybe she's there.

783
01:05:10,333 --> 01:05:11,708
Come with me.

784
01:05:14,541 --> 01:05:19,416
Prinsa!

785
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:22,875
Prinsa!

786
01:05:22,958 --> 01:05:24,375
Sa!

787
01:05:24,458 --> 01:05:26,041
Prinsa!

788
01:05:26,125 --> 01:05:27,458
Sa!

789
01:05:27,541 --> 01:05:30,458
Prinsa!

790
01:05:30,541 --> 01:05:34,875
- Prinsa!
- Prinsa!

791
01:05:34,958 --> 01:05:37,333
- Prinsa!
- Prinsa!

792
01:05:37,416 --> 01:05:43,458
- Prinsa!
- Prinsa!

793
01:05:44,208 --> 01:05:45,333
I heard something.

794
01:05:49,583 --> 01:05:50,916
There she is. Prinsa!

795
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:52,958
Sa…

796
01:05:53,041 --> 01:05:54,166
Prinsa.

797
01:06:05,041 --> 01:06:07,166
Prinsa…

798
01:06:11,125 --> 01:06:12,458
Prinsa…

799
01:06:16,958 --> 01:06:18,666
Tie her hands!

800
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:23,250
Quickly!

801
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,291
We have her.

802
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:31,708
Quickly, let's go.

803
01:06:33,458 --> 01:06:37,541
THE RITUAL FOR PRINSA BEGINS.

804
01:06:41,666 --> 01:06:42,958
Stand her up.

805
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:44,541
Okay, Mak.

806
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:51,750
Prinsa!

807
01:06:51,833 --> 01:06:53,208
Stop it, Prinsa!

808
01:06:53,291 --> 01:06:56,958
Mak!

809
01:06:57,041 --> 01:06:58,916
Tie her with the mat.

810
01:06:59,333 --> 01:07:02,083
Wrap her, tie her with the mat. Guys!

811
01:07:03,041 --> 01:07:04,125
Hurry up!

812
01:07:05,666 --> 01:07:06,750
Wrap her.

813
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:09,125
Wrap her with the mat.

814
01:07:10,291 --> 01:07:11,333
Go inside.

815
01:07:12,666 --> 01:07:13,708
Don't go out.

816
01:07:15,625 --> 01:07:16,666
Go there.

817
01:07:17,875 --> 01:07:21,708
He said, whatever happens,
we need to stay inside.

818
01:07:29,916 --> 01:07:31,458
Bay, I'm leaving, okay?

819
01:08:16,666 --> 01:08:18,083
This ritual

820
01:08:18,166 --> 01:08:20,333
can't tie the supernatural just like that.

821
01:08:21,416 --> 01:08:24,458
Just moving it from the girl's body

822
01:08:24,541 --> 01:08:25,916
to another body…

823
01:08:29,791 --> 01:08:32,166
isn't what we hoped for.

824
01:08:33,416 --> 01:08:37,166
Just in case,
we've prepared a dead animal.

825
01:08:39,166 --> 01:08:42,833
But it's the entity that will decide.

826
01:08:43,333 --> 01:08:45,416
If it's the human who will die

827
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:48,000
or the animal.

828
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:52,833
We ask for permission and forgiveness.

829
01:08:52,916 --> 01:08:54,291
To our ancestor

830
01:08:54,916 --> 01:08:56,500
who rules the sea.

831
01:08:57,458 --> 01:09:03,375
The ancestors from the north, the west,
the east and the south.

832
01:09:03,458 --> 01:09:05,583
The exalted and the wise ones.

833
01:09:06,875 --> 01:09:10,458
The dark shapeshifter
that rules the earth.

834
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:15,833
Now we shall start the ritual.

835
01:09:16,958 --> 01:09:18,000
Let's start.

836
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:33,958
Get out!

837
01:09:34,625 --> 01:09:35,875
Why?

838
01:09:37,291 --> 01:09:40,791
You're inside
someone else's body, it's a sin!

839
01:09:40,875 --> 01:09:42,208
Why?

840
01:09:42,291 --> 01:09:44,833
You're inside
someone else's body, it's a sin!

841
01:09:44,916 --> 01:09:46,875
Your mouth stinks!

842
01:09:46,958 --> 01:09:48,458
You're the one who stinks!

843
01:09:50,541 --> 01:09:53,083
Now, go home!

844
01:09:53,166 --> 01:09:55,500
Go back to your world!

845
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:57,708
The world of calm.

846
01:09:57,791 --> 01:09:58,958
No way!

847
01:10:00,166 --> 01:10:01,833
What do you want?

848
01:10:04,583 --> 01:10:07,666
I want you to see.

849
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:10,333
A very beautiful place.

850
01:10:11,333 --> 01:10:13,291
Full of fire!

851
01:10:13,458 --> 01:10:16,000
Get out!

852
01:10:16,083 --> 01:10:19,000
You have a dark heart.

853
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:29,333
I have a dark heart.

854
01:10:29,416 --> 01:10:33,708
I have a dark heart.

855
01:11:10,583 --> 01:11:12,083
Get out!

856
01:11:13,041 --> 01:11:14,083
No way!

857
01:11:17,083 --> 01:11:19,291
Get out!

858
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:20,583
No way!

859
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,041
Get out!

860
01:11:48,916 --> 01:11:51,166
Brother, what should we do?

861
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:52,625
Be patient.

862
01:11:53,416 --> 01:11:54,833
Let's just wait and see.

863
01:12:04,083 --> 01:12:06,125
Keep recording!

864
01:12:06,458 --> 01:12:08,125
Bring her here.

865
01:12:08,208 --> 01:12:10,083
Hurry, bring her here.

866
01:12:10,166 --> 01:12:11,500
Make her stand here.

867
01:12:16,166 --> 01:12:17,708
Come on. Make her stand.

868
01:12:20,458 --> 01:12:21,500
Stop.

869
01:12:22,375 --> 01:12:24,500
Now, tie her hands.

870
01:12:24,583 --> 01:12:25,625
Tie her hands.

871
01:12:36,250 --> 01:12:40,958
A long time ago, you were born here.

872
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:45,333
But now it's not your place anymore.

873
01:12:46,833 --> 01:12:48,250
Go.

874
01:12:48,333 --> 01:12:50,291
Go back to where you belong.

875
01:12:54,333 --> 01:12:55,416
Arja,

876
01:12:56,083 --> 01:12:57,375
slaughter it.

877
01:12:59,791 --> 01:13:00,958
Take its blood.

878
01:13:08,916 --> 01:13:11,791
Taste that blood.

879
01:13:11,875 --> 01:13:13,416
Taste it!

880
01:13:26,208 --> 01:13:27,375
This…

881
01:13:27,458 --> 01:13:28,708
This is not right.

882
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:33,125
If it's getting worse,
we need to go to them.

883
01:13:41,833 --> 01:13:43,291
Where am I?

884
01:13:43,375 --> 01:13:46,750
- Bayu!
- It usually doesn't last long.

885
01:13:46,833 --> 01:13:49,958
Help! I want to go home.

886
01:13:51,791 --> 01:13:54,583
I want to go home.

887
01:14:04,250 --> 01:14:05,875
Ito!

888
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:09,458
Hurry.

889
01:14:14,166 --> 01:14:16,541
Tie her with the mat.

890
01:14:20,125 --> 01:14:23,416
Quick, spirit, get out!

891
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:26,833
Tie her with the mat.

892
01:14:26,916 --> 01:14:30,041
Quick, spirit, get out!

893
01:14:37,375 --> 01:14:40,916
I have been there.

894
01:14:43,166 --> 01:14:45,291
It's scorching!

895
01:14:46,541 --> 01:14:49,833
So beautiful!

896
01:14:51,916 --> 01:14:55,208
When I get there,

897
01:14:55,291 --> 01:14:57,375
I'll come get you!

898
01:14:57,458 --> 01:14:59,875
Let's go.

899
01:15:03,791 --> 01:15:05,250
What are you doing here?

900
01:15:16,708 --> 01:15:18,333
Sister?

901
01:15:18,875 --> 01:15:20,375
- Get in.
- Get back in!

902
01:15:20,458 --> 01:15:22,000
- But…
- Get back in!

903
01:15:29,833 --> 01:15:33,791
I want to eat.

904
01:15:36,708 --> 01:15:40,000
I want to eat.

905
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:49,000
Do you have a newborn baby?

906
01:15:52,416 --> 01:15:54,583
Do you have a newborn baby?

907
01:15:59,041 --> 01:16:01,083
Do you have a newborn baby?

908
01:16:05,708 --> 01:16:08,833
May I eat it?

909
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:33,958
Oh, God…

910
01:16:42,083 --> 01:16:48,083
Ki, Neti has been chosen.

911
01:16:48,166 --> 01:16:50,208
Come here, Ki. Look.

912
01:16:50,291 --> 01:16:51,791
Ki, Neti has been chosen, Ki.

913
01:16:51,875 --> 01:16:53,583
Neti!

914
01:16:53,666 --> 01:16:55,375
Get her up.

915
01:17:00,666 --> 01:17:03,916
Be careful. Take her hands first.

916
01:17:07,458 --> 01:17:10,833
The elders of the universe have chosen.

917
01:17:10,916 --> 01:17:13,666
The elders of the universe have chosen.

918
01:17:14,916 --> 01:17:16,708
Move Neti from there quickly.

919
01:17:18,125 --> 01:17:19,250
Move her!

920
01:17:21,041 --> 01:17:23,916
Move her dead body here.

921
01:17:34,833 --> 01:17:38,333
This body is not yours,
your place is in the grave.

922
01:17:39,666 --> 01:17:41,708
It went out. The light went out.

923
01:17:43,166 --> 01:17:44,750
Not only the light.

924
01:17:45,958 --> 01:17:47,250
The fire too.

925
01:17:48,375 --> 01:17:50,000
All the torches also went out.

926
01:17:51,583 --> 01:17:52,833
Why is it so quiet here?

927
01:17:55,041 --> 01:17:56,125
Something's off.

928
01:17:57,041 --> 01:18:00,000
Yan, turn the camera light on now.
And hold the camera.

929
01:18:00,083 --> 01:18:01,333
Okay.

930
01:18:01,416 --> 01:18:02,500
Mic!

931
01:18:04,333 --> 01:18:05,583
Indy, hold Iko.

932
01:18:06,041 --> 01:18:08,166
- Ga, what's going on?
- We must stay close.

933
01:18:25,166 --> 01:18:27,375
Ga, can you explain this?

934
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:34,166
Aki said, during the ritual,
a gate will open.

935
01:18:35,291 --> 01:18:37,000
The gate must be opened now.

936
01:18:37,208 --> 01:18:39,166
Brother, Prinsa is missing.

937
01:18:39,250 --> 01:18:40,708
Don't let her be alone.

938
01:18:40,791 --> 01:18:44,000
- Don't let her be alone.
- Bay, calm down!

939
01:18:44,083 --> 01:18:45,916
Bayu!

940
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,666
I will not let her be alone.

941
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:50,666
We'll find her. Let's split.

942
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:54,458
- Angga, Indy and Bayu, you go with Ryan.
- Okay.

943
01:18:54,541 --> 01:18:57,958
- Nicko and I, we're together.
- Okay.

944
01:18:58,041 --> 01:19:00,958
Let's split. Angga, you go there.
We will go there.

945
01:19:01,041 --> 01:19:02,708
- We will go there.
- Okay.

946
01:19:02,791 --> 01:19:04,250
Keep holding my hand.

947
01:19:05,291 --> 01:19:06,625
Go first.

948
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:11,541
Prinsa?

949
01:19:11,625 --> 01:19:12,666
Prinsa?

950
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:15,208
Check over there.

951
01:19:16,458 --> 01:19:17,500
Sa?

952
01:19:18,666 --> 01:19:19,791
Prinsa?

953
01:19:24,291 --> 01:19:25,500
Prinsa?

954
01:19:29,458 --> 01:19:30,708
You wait over here.

955
01:19:36,875 --> 01:19:38,125
Prinsa?

956
01:19:45,375 --> 01:19:46,583
Sa?

957
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:49,458
She's not here.

958
01:19:51,833 --> 01:19:52,958
Prinsa.

959
01:19:53,791 --> 01:19:56,208
- Let's look over there.
- Let's go.

960
01:19:56,291 --> 01:19:57,500
Sa?

961
01:19:59,458 --> 01:20:00,750
Let's continue our search.

962
01:20:07,041 --> 01:20:08,333
Where else should we look?

963
01:20:09,125 --> 01:20:10,333
I don't know.

964
01:20:13,416 --> 01:20:14,541
Dan?

965
01:20:15,875 --> 01:20:17,875
I thought…

966
01:20:19,791 --> 01:20:21,041
Let's continue our search.

967
01:20:30,166 --> 01:20:31,708
That sounds like the villagers.

968
01:20:32,625 --> 01:20:33,958
Let's just ask them.

969
01:20:34,041 --> 01:20:35,750
No.

970
01:20:35,833 --> 01:20:38,916
No, they're not human.

971
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,291
Let's just let them pass.
Turn off the light.

972
01:20:42,125 --> 01:20:43,416
Let's hide.

973
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:53,541
Nick.

974
01:20:54,458 --> 01:20:55,500
What?

975
01:20:58,375 --> 01:21:00,291
Don't look.

976
01:21:08,833 --> 01:21:11,583
Let's move.

977
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:20,291
Prinsa?

978
01:21:21,708 --> 01:21:24,125
- Bay, it's Prinsa.
- Prinsa!

979
01:21:25,416 --> 01:21:27,916
- Sa!
- Prinsa!

980
01:21:29,166 --> 01:21:30,833
- Sa?
- Sa?

981
01:21:30,916 --> 01:21:32,041
Prinsa?

982
01:21:33,416 --> 01:21:35,000
- Sa?
- Prinsa?

983
01:21:38,083 --> 01:21:39,500
- Sa?
- Prinsa?

984
01:21:39,583 --> 01:21:40,833
Sa?

985
01:21:46,541 --> 01:21:48,041
Dy. No.

986
01:21:57,458 --> 01:21:58,541
Angga!

987
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,208
- There, Bay.
- Where?

988
01:22:06,041 --> 01:22:07,458
Shit! Prinsa!

989
01:22:08,458 --> 01:22:09,541
Prinsa!

990
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,333
Listen.

991
01:22:17,416 --> 01:22:18,708
Listen to that.

992
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:43,666
The coffin Prinsa was in is here.

993
01:22:47,958 --> 01:22:49,708
Let's try saving Prinsa.

994
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:55,583
<i>Lake, forest, sea!</i>

995
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,500
<i>The words of the north</i>

996
01:23:04,583 --> 01:23:07,416
<i>needs to be obeyed.</i>

997
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:11,083
<i>Lake, forest, sea!</i>

998
01:23:17,375 --> 01:23:21,208
It comes. It has come.

999
01:23:22,791 --> 01:23:28,166
It's bitter.

1000
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,541
It has come!

1001
01:23:34,625 --> 01:23:35,791
What should we do?

1002
01:23:35,875 --> 01:23:38,416
Bitter, here.

1003
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,375
What should we do?

1004
01:23:55,625 --> 01:23:57,750
- Brother.
- Brother.

1005
01:23:58,208 --> 01:24:01,208
Let's leave.

1006
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:11,166
They're not chasing us anymore.

1007
01:24:11,250 --> 01:24:12,666
But let's walk slowly.

1008
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:14,041
Ryan, come on.

1009
01:24:16,291 --> 01:24:18,875
Sister. Bay.

1010
01:24:18,958 --> 01:24:20,250
Sa!

1011
01:24:20,333 --> 01:24:22,000
Prinsa!

1012
01:24:22,083 --> 01:24:24,791
Her eyes are normal. She's conscious.

1013
01:24:24,875 --> 01:24:26,791
Thank God.

1014
01:24:26,875 --> 01:24:28,333
Where am I?

1015
01:24:28,416 --> 01:24:29,791
We need to get out now.

1016
01:24:31,583 --> 01:24:33,500
Brother, why are they here?

1017
01:24:35,291 --> 01:24:37,750
Angga, what's going on here?

1018
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,333
Why are they like this?

1019
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:45,416
Are we back to our realm?

1020
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:46,625
Right?

1021
01:24:46,708 --> 01:24:48,416
Return Prinsa to the coffin.

1022
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,166
Come on, Sa.

1023
01:24:50,250 --> 01:24:51,625
No.

1024
01:25:04,375 --> 01:25:06,583
You don't belong here!

1025
01:25:07,833 --> 01:25:09,666
Go.

1026
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:11,708
Go back to where you belong.

1027
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:15,750
You don't belong here!

1028
01:25:15,833 --> 01:25:17,666
Sister!

1029
01:25:17,750 --> 01:25:19,125
Are you okay?

1030
01:25:19,208 --> 01:25:21,500
You don't belong here!

1031
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,916
Samex! Samex is out!

1032
01:25:50,166 --> 01:25:52,208
Brother, he's cured.

1033
01:25:52,291 --> 01:25:55,791
Our village is free from Samex.

1034
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,041
Take Prinsa back.

1035
01:26:06,125 --> 01:26:07,166
Is it finished?

1036
01:26:07,250 --> 01:26:08,291
It's done.

1037
01:26:08,375 --> 01:26:10,333
Hurry, take Prinsa back.

1038
01:26:10,416 --> 01:26:11,791
Nicko.

1039
01:26:34,166 --> 01:26:38,208
<i>They succeeded in</i>
<i>casting the spirit out of Prinsa's body.</i>

1040
01:26:38,291 --> 01:26:40,875
<i>Prinsa and the team</i>
<i>were allowed to go home.</i>

1041
01:26:40,958 --> 01:26:44,625
<i>But the ritual went on.</i>

1042
01:26:44,708 --> 01:26:46,625
<i>We were not allowed to cover it.</i>

1043
01:26:46,708 --> 01:26:52,125
<i>I don't know if the village succeeded</i>
<i>in cutting its ties with the supernatural.</i>

1044
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:57,500
<i>I felt guilty for saying</i>
<i>its name carelessly</i>

1045
01:26:57,583 --> 01:27:01,166
<i>and making people</i>
<i>curious about its existence.</i>

1046
01:27:02,458 --> 01:27:05,083
<i>The incident was the most terrifying</i>

1047
01:27:05,166 --> 01:27:08,833
<i>and the saddest,</i>
<i>which was hard for us to share.</i>

1048
01:27:09,958 --> 01:27:11,958
<i>And after the incident,</i>

1049
01:27:12,041 --> 01:27:18,833
<i>I decided not to make content</i>
<i>for a few weeks.</i>

1050
01:27:20,125 --> 01:27:23,000
<i>Whichever name</i>
<i>of the supernatural creature</i>

1051
01:27:23,083 --> 01:27:25,583
<i>that you see and hear in this movie,</i>

1052
01:27:25,666 --> 01:27:29,708
<i>don't ever call out its name,</i>
<i>or even think about it for a long time.</i>

1053
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:34,541
Because they can really come
and take over your life.

1054
01:27:35,041 --> 01:27:40,041
It can come when you're not ready.

1055
01:27:41,916 --> 01:27:45,708
All that happened in that village
was out of our control.

1056
01:27:45,791 --> 01:27:48,083
It's hard for us to believe it,
but we know there's always

1057
01:27:48,166 --> 01:27:50,375
a lesson learned
for everything that happens.

1058
01:27:50,458 --> 01:27:53,916
Don't ever call its name again.

1059
01:27:55,416 --> 01:27:58,041
{\an8}Hi, my name is Prinsa.

1060
01:27:58,125 --> 01:27:59,250
{\an8}PRINSA MANDAGIE
RESOURCE PERSON

1061
01:27:59,333 --> 01:28:05,041
{\an8}I want to apologize to Risa, Angga, Indy

1062
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,708
and all of <i>Jurnal Risa's</i> team.

1063
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,458
And I also want to say
thank you very much

1064
01:28:13,958 --> 01:28:17,958
for helping me and Bayu
throughout the incident.

1065
01:28:23,125 --> 01:28:27,125
I've learnt my lesson that

1066
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:32,250
there's no point in me existing

1067
01:28:34,166 --> 01:28:36,875
without being myself.

1068
01:28:41,208 --> 01:28:43,250
This is a big lesson for me.

1069
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:50,541
<i>Peace be upon you.</i>
<i>Welcome to</i> Jurnal Risa.

1070
01:28:50,625 --> 01:28:52,875
<i>Maybe it feels weird</i>

1071
01:28:52,958 --> 01:28:55,875
<i>when</i> Jurnal Risa <i>came to the cemetery.</i>

1072
01:28:55,958 --> 01:28:58,208
We are now going back to our hometown.

1073
01:28:58,291 --> 01:29:00,208
So, this is

1074
01:29:00,291 --> 01:29:03,541
our Grandma's hometown.

1075
01:29:03,791 --> 01:29:07,333
I will not reveal the place.

1076
01:29:07,625 --> 01:29:09,541
<i>Jurnal Risa,</i>

1077
01:29:09,958 --> 01:29:13,958
the searching at my house,
part two, there was

1078
01:29:14,375 --> 01:29:16,208
a moment

1079
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:19,500
when I was possessed
in the squat position.

1080
01:29:19,791 --> 01:29:23,083
<i>She asked for their praying.</i>

1081
01:29:23,458 --> 01:29:26,333
So, we looked for her grave.

1082
01:29:30,333 --> 01:29:34,708
Don't come. Here is enough.

1083
01:29:38,708 --> 01:29:40,875
I don't have anything with you.

1084
01:29:40,958 --> 01:29:43,000
Answer it, Andi.

1085
01:30:15,375 --> 01:30:18,041
- What do you think?
- I saw a <i>pocong</i> here.

1086
01:30:18,125 --> 01:30:20,541
As tall as a tree.

1087
01:30:20,625 --> 01:30:22,875
That tall?

1088
01:30:48,583 --> 01:30:52,958
Panicking. Just going around
with nowhere to go.

1089
01:30:53,750 --> 01:30:56,583
You're thirsty.
There's no food and drink here.

1090
01:31:17,708 --> 01:31:21,166
Don't do that, Fahrul.
Hey. Fahrul, get up.

1091
01:31:26,291 --> 01:31:28,583
He usually says something?

1092
01:31:46,791 --> 01:31:48,291
- Risa?
- Yes?

1093
01:31:48,375 --> 01:31:49,958
Help!

1094
01:31:51,083 --> 01:31:53,958
- There's another one.
- My goodness.

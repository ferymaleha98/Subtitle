3
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,795
Some individuals are recognized
by their name,

4
00:04:56,878 --> 00:04:58,878
while others are known for their work.

5
00:04:58,961 --> 00:05:00,503
However, there are those

6
00:05:00,586 --> 00:05:03,088
who establish their reputation
through their work.

7
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:06,137
Today, we will meet one such warrior,

8
00:05:06,217 --> 00:05:07,520
who, three years ago,

9
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,931
made the move from Maharashtra
to Srinagar

10
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:11,468
to take on the role of SSP for SOG.

11
00:05:11,548 --> 00:05:13,230
Senior Superintendent of Police,

12
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,664
Bajirao Singham.

13
00:06:45,461 --> 00:06:49,322
please can you tell our viewers
how the SOG operates?

14
00:06:49,402 --> 00:06:51,361
SOG was formed in 1994,

15
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,986
at the peak of militancy
in the region.

16
00:06:54,069 --> 00:06:58,444
Back then, the SOG did not have
a designated base of its own.

17
00:06:58,527 --> 00:07:01,361
Instead, they began operations
from the Air India cargo facility.

18
00:07:01,444 --> 00:07:05,152
SOG's headquarters is still referred
to as Cargo.

19
00:07:07,152 --> 00:07:09,277
Most ordinary people don't know

20
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:12,861
that 80% of the SOG commandos
are actually locals.

21
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:20,486
Whenever there is an attack,

22
00:07:20,984 --> 00:07:23,652
the J&K SOG is the first responder
on the scene.

23
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:34,694
We have our own intel network
and bulletproof vehicles.

24
00:07:39,736 --> 00:07:41,777
One of our primary missions now is

25
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:43,819
to prevent the radicalization
of children in the region.

26
00:07:43,944 --> 00:07:45,796
You'd be surprised to know that

27
00:07:45,876 --> 00:07:49,402
SOG even has reformed militants
working within its ranks,

28
00:07:49,486 --> 00:07:51,402
who now serve the country.

29
00:07:53,986 --> 00:07:55,402
One last question:

30
00:07:55,486 --> 00:07:58,527
Why did you choose
to become a police officer?

31
00:07:59,365 --> 00:08:02,694
Ma'am, that's because stars
look best in the sky

32
00:08:03,236 --> 00:08:05,152
or when they adorn
the shoulders of brave men.

33
00:08:28,653 --> 00:08:30,152
How are you?

34
00:08:30,236 --> 00:08:31,694
I'm fine.

35
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:33,111
Shaurya?

36
00:08:33,194 --> 00:08:34,319
He's doing fine too.

37
00:08:34,402 --> 00:08:36,069
He really misses you.

38
00:08:36,152 --> 00:08:37,569
You'll be here
for his birthday, right?

39
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:39,194
Yes, I'll be there.

40
00:08:39,277 --> 00:08:40,694
If you don't show up, just remember

41
00:08:40,777 --> 00:08:42,611
I work for the Cultural Ministry.

42
00:08:42,694 --> 00:08:45,614
I could speak to the Home Minister
and get my husband transferred.

43
00:08:45,694 --> 00:08:47,527
Please don't do that, ma'am!

44
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,032
I'm just a regular police officer.

45
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:51,194
Cut it out and come home soon.

46
00:08:51,757 --> 00:08:52,944
- Bye.
- Bye.

47
00:12:53,277 --> 00:12:56,813
Omar Hafiz, don't assume
the story ends here.

48
00:12:56,893 --> 00:12:59,694
Do you have any idea where I am

49
00:12:59,777 --> 00:13:01,527
and what I'm capable of?

50
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:39,277
Stone pelting is old-fashioned, sir.

51
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:42,111
This is the new Kashmir
of a new India.

52
00:15:42,236 --> 00:15:43,736
We are all with you.

53
00:16:45,574 --> 00:16:47,113
Omar Hafiz.

54
00:16:48,109 --> 00:16:51,652
I never imagined fate
would be so kind to me.

55
00:16:52,927 --> 00:16:54,477
I was looking for you,

56
00:16:55,321 --> 00:16:56,652
and here you are.

57
00:16:56,736 --> 00:16:57,902
Did you really think

58
00:16:58,874 --> 00:17:01,819
it would be that easy
to get rid of Bajirao Singham?

59
00:17:04,887 --> 00:17:07,277
How do you feel witnessing
the new India?

60
00:17:08,202 --> 00:17:12,944
I bet you're regretting your decision
of running away from India.

61
00:17:13,527 --> 00:17:15,527
But you should be happy

62
00:17:16,794 --> 00:17:19,351
After dying like your sons did

63
00:17:19,431 --> 00:17:22,257
you too will have the honor
of being laid to rest in this land.

64
00:17:22,337 --> 00:17:23,944
You are right.

65
00:17:25,938 --> 00:17:29,569
Your fate has been kind to you,
and that's why you're still alive.

66
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:31,444
However, I promise you one thing:

67
00:17:31,527 --> 00:17:34,735
I will claim your last breath.

68
00:17:34,815 --> 00:17:37,736
Because the deaths of you
and your friends

69
00:17:39,412 --> 00:17:43,527
is the only goal of
Omar Hafiz's lineage.

70
00:17:44,695 --> 00:17:47,362
You're on your own
in this battle now, Omar.

71
00:17:48,195 --> 00:17:50,737
The youth of Kashmir is evolving,

72
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,612
and the youth of Pakistan
is becoming more aware.

73
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:57,737
Our children won't get swayed
by the likes of you anymore.

74
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,779
But you already know that very well.

75
00:17:59,862 --> 00:18:02,945
That's why you left Pakistan
and fled to Sri Lanka,

76
00:18:03,071 --> 00:18:04,654
where you started selling drugs.

77
00:18:04,737 --> 00:18:08,814
Don't think that you've won
this battle by capturing me.

78
00:18:08,894 --> 00:18:10,914
I am not alone.

79
00:18:11,895 --> 00:18:13,461
There is someone...

80
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,914
planning your funeral.

81
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,529
He will definitely come.

82
00:18:17,612 --> 00:18:20,487
I will bury him in that very coffin

83
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:23,779
Don't make the mistake
of underestimating him, Singham.

84
00:18:24,695 --> 00:18:26,925
He's a firestorm.

85
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:32,362
He will turn your
and your country's ego to ashes.

86
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:35,237
Why is your storm bothering
to come after me?

87
00:18:35,612 --> 00:18:36,945
Just tell me where he is.

88
00:18:39,029 --> 00:18:40,721
As you know,

89
00:18:40,801 --> 00:18:43,445
India now infiltrates and eliminates.

90
00:18:43,525 --> 00:18:46,029
I'll be damned.

91
00:18:56,533 --> 00:18:59,612
Omar Hafiz's arrest is a great
achievement, Singham.

92
00:18:59,695 --> 00:19:02,820
But what's more important
is that you are safe.

93
00:19:02,904 --> 00:19:05,070
I've been in this uniform
for 20 years, sir.

94
00:19:05,237 --> 00:19:06,853
I don't fear death anymore.

95
00:19:06,933 --> 00:19:10,723
Our intelligence has been trying
to track Omar's network.

96
00:19:10,857 --> 00:19:13,029
There's a port in Sri Lanka

97
00:19:13,109 --> 00:19:16,279
where they repair ships
in a private section.

98
00:19:16,362 --> 00:19:18,654
It's owned by John Lucas, a Russian.

99
00:19:18,737 --> 00:19:20,987
He has connections to Omar Hafiz.

100
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:23,737
We requested the Sri Lankan authorities
to interrogate him,

101
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:28,279
but you're aware of the current
situation there.

102
00:19:31,487 --> 00:19:34,737
He has rapidly expanded
his drug network in just a few days.

103
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,529
He orders drugs from Afghanistan,
which arrive in Sri Lanka.

104
00:19:37,612 --> 00:19:41,904
From there, they reach
the coastal areas of Tamil Nadu.

105
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:45,154
And from that point,
they're distributed throughout India.

106
00:19:45,987 --> 00:19:48,737
The money Omar makes

107
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,612
from this is used against our country.

108
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:55,695
I'm sorry, sir, but this is a failure
of our intelligence network.

109
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:57,820
In every state, there are officers

110
00:19:57,904 --> 00:20:03,355
who withhold intel from
other police just to claim credit.

111
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:06,820
Due to lack of evidence
and judicial restrictions,

112
00:20:06,904 --> 00:20:09,487
the forces can't operate effectively.

113
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:13,860
That's why individuals like
Omar exploit the situation.

114
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,612
I know, Singham.

115
00:20:15,808 --> 00:20:18,154
That's why sir has given us orders

116
00:20:18,237 --> 00:20:20,987
to establish a new task force.

117
00:20:21,315 --> 00:20:24,529
It will be a new bureau,
similar to the CBI, IB, and R&AW.

118
00:20:24,612 --> 00:20:26,989
It will operate directly under us

119
00:20:27,069 --> 00:20:31,493
And Singham, I'm appointing
you as the Chief of this bureau.

120
00:20:31,573 --> 00:20:34,612
You'll have your own squad and budget.

121
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:36,404
There will be no judiciary for you.

122
00:20:36,487 --> 00:20:38,737
Every state's police
will work with you

123
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,904
and you'll only report to me.

124
00:20:40,987 --> 00:20:42,195
But why me, sir?

125
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:43,820
Well, it's because of you

126
00:20:43,904 --> 00:20:48,445
that we have officers known
as Bihar's Singham,

127
00:20:48,529 --> 00:20:51,487
Punjab's Singham, Tamil Nadu's,

128
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:54,029
Gujarat' Singham in our police force,

129
00:20:54,154 --> 00:20:57,612
and they all see you as their hero.

130
00:20:57,692 --> 00:20:58,695
That means there won't be
any egos getting

131
00:20:58,779 --> 00:21:00,362
in the way of working together.

132
00:21:02,654 --> 00:21:04,070
Sir and the name of this squad?

133
00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:06,820
Shiva.

134
00:21:28,931 --> 00:21:31,806
Just nine days to explore
the history of a country

135
00:21:31,889 --> 00:21:35,389
that spans over 9,000 years?

136
00:21:35,847 --> 00:21:36,847
It will be enough,

137
00:21:36,931 --> 00:21:39,222
as this Ramleela play,
spanning nine days,

138
00:21:39,306 --> 00:21:43,306
promises to be a very unique
and wholesome family experience.

139
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:45,306
This is a grand celebration...

140
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:47,347
of our culture's rich history.

141
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:50,139
I know many people in India believe

142
00:21:50,222 --> 00:21:52,514
that the Ramayan is merely a story,

143
00:21:53,431 --> 00:21:54,764
and not a part of our history.

144
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:56,306
In fact, some of those
individuals might be

145
00:21:56,389 --> 00:21:58,347
in the audience right now,

146
00:21:58,514 --> 00:22:00,514
like my son, Shaurya.

147
00:22:01,889 --> 00:22:03,222
Hi, Shaurya.

148
00:22:06,139 --> 00:22:07,431
But I assure you,

149
00:22:07,511 --> 00:22:09,181
our distinctive Ramayan

150
00:22:09,264 --> 00:22:10,889
will not be confined to Ayodhya.

151
00:22:10,972 --> 00:22:12,601
You'll find its remnants

152
00:22:12,681 --> 00:22:15,431
in places like Panchvati in Nashik

153
00:22:15,511 --> 00:22:16,889
and even in Sri Lanka.

154
00:22:16,972 --> 00:22:18,389
We will present evidence of everything

155
00:22:18,469 --> 00:22:20,431
that took place in this journey.

156
00:22:20,556 --> 00:22:22,514
From Hampi,

157
00:22:22,597 --> 00:22:24,889
where Lord Ram and Lord Hanuman met,

158
00:22:24,972 --> 00:22:27,847
to the footprints of Lord Hanuman
in Sri Lanka.

159
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:30,889
We'll reveal the secrets of miraculous
herbs found in the mountains there,

160
00:22:30,972 --> 00:22:34,847
and a location where satellites
temporarily lose signal due

161
00:22:34,931 --> 00:22:38,306
to a low gravitational field.

162
00:22:38,389 --> 00:22:39,639
We promise you,

163
00:22:39,722 --> 00:22:42,472
it is going to be an experience
you'll never forget.

164
00:22:45,713 --> 00:22:47,722
Today, we will begin
with the Swayamvar (wedding)

165
00:22:47,806 --> 00:22:50,847
of Lord Ram and Mother Sita.

166
00:22:50,931 --> 00:22:52,428
Gautam.

167
00:22:56,764 --> 00:22:59,056
This is Janakpur,
the Mithila Palace,

168
00:22:59,139 --> 00:23:02,683
where the Swayamvar of Lord Ram
and Mother Sita took place.

169
00:23:02,763 --> 00:23:04,847
Do you know where this is located?

170
00:23:04,931 --> 00:23:05,931
It's in Nepal.

171
00:23:06,014 --> 00:23:08,431
People travel from far
and wide to visit this palace.

172
00:23:08,514 --> 00:23:12,431
Similarly, we will continue to present
you with evidence as we move forward.

173
00:23:19,389 --> 00:23:21,222
All the best, Avni.

174
00:23:21,306 --> 00:23:22,601
Where's Singham?

175
00:23:22,681 --> 00:23:23,972
Are you really asking me that?

176
00:23:24,056 --> 00:23:25,972
Thanks to you, ever since the
Shiva Squad was established,

177
00:23:26,056 --> 00:23:28,847
he's been out on missions more often
and spending less time at home.

178
00:23:30,306 --> 00:23:31,389
- Please, come.
- Okay.

179
00:23:31,469 --> 00:23:32,306
Just go and ask him to make a list

180
00:23:32,389 --> 00:23:34,097
- Swara, all set?
- Yes, ma'am.

181
00:23:34,181 --> 00:23:35,722
Sixty seconds to go.

182
00:23:35,806 --> 00:23:38,806
Ma'am, you have special guests -

183
00:23:38,889 --> 00:23:40,264
officers from the Shiva Squad.

184
00:23:40,347 --> 00:23:41,431
Hello, ma'am.

185
00:23:41,511 --> 00:23:43,056
The show looks grand, ma'am!

186
00:23:43,181 --> 00:23:44,097
All the best.

187
00:23:44,181 --> 00:23:46,014
Your hard work is clearly evident.

188
00:23:46,097 --> 00:23:48,514
Singham Sir was so excited
to be here.

189
00:23:49,764 --> 00:23:51,431
I know what you're getting at.

190
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:53,681
I know my husband very well.

191
00:23:53,764 --> 00:23:54,847
He couldn't make it,

192
00:23:54,931 --> 00:23:56,347
so he sent you two
to cover for him instead.

193
00:23:56,431 --> 00:23:57,847
No, no, ma'am, not at all.

194
00:23:57,931 --> 00:24:01,014
Ma'am, sir has sent something for you.

195
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:33,578
The leader of a Holy Land.

196
00:24:40,051 --> 00:24:41,112
The powerful,

197
00:24:41,192 --> 00:24:42,578
The knowledgeable.

198
00:24:49,202 --> 00:24:50,652
The roar of Courage.

199
00:24:50,732 --> 00:24:52,070
The roar of Virtue.

200
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:53,305
A Leader.

201
00:24:53,385 --> 00:24:54,357
A warrior.

202
00:24:54,437 --> 00:24:56,648
he Almighty.

203
00:25:00,668 --> 00:25:04,353
The world knows him as Ram.

204
00:25:36,181 --> 00:25:37,889
What's the police doing here?

205
00:25:38,565 --> 00:25:39,847
it's not the police.

206
00:25:40,846 --> 00:25:42,222
That's my dad.

207
00:25:43,389 --> 00:25:46,889
Have you two made a vow
to always embarrass me?

208
00:25:47,014 --> 00:25:49,306
Mom, that day at the function,

209
00:25:49,389 --> 00:25:52,358
you pinpointed me
in front of everyone!

210
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,985
And today, Dad,

211
00:25:54,068 --> 00:25:56,443
you showed up
at Melvin's party unannounced!

212
00:25:56,526 --> 00:25:58,068
Do you know
what my friends thought?

213
00:25:58,151 --> 00:26:00,696
They literally felt like
the police had raided the place.

214
00:26:00,776 --> 00:26:02,443
It was so embarrassing, Mom.

215
00:26:02,943 --> 00:26:04,026
Amazing!

216
00:26:04,485 --> 00:26:07,151
Now you find your parents embarrassing!

217
00:26:07,276 --> 00:26:08,526
So what if he showed up there?

218
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,193
It's not like that, Mom.

219
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,068
I admit Dad's the GOAT.

220
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,901
GOAT?

221
00:26:13,985 --> 00:26:15,136
Greatest of all time.

222
00:26:15,268 --> 00:26:17,860
But guys,
I have a life of my own, right?

223
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:19,776
Of course, he has a life of his own.

224
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,526
That's why he's leaving his family
and his country to go to London!

225
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:23,860
Oh God, Mom!

226
00:26:24,055 --> 00:26:27,223
Don't you think you're being
a bit overdramatic?

227
00:26:27,303 --> 00:26:28,452
Ramayan, country...

228
00:26:28,532 --> 00:26:31,735
Mom, you really need to stop enforcing
your outdated beliefs on me please.

229
00:26:31,815 --> 00:26:34,026
Hey, Shaurya, behave yourself!

230
00:26:34,211 --> 00:26:35,816
This is the problem
with his generation.

231
00:26:35,946 --> 00:26:37,401
They think our traditions

232
00:26:37,485 --> 00:26:39,026
and culture are all outdated.

233
00:26:39,106 --> 00:26:42,205
I had such big dreams for you
when you were born!

234
00:26:42,285 --> 00:26:46,110
I told your dad you would grow up
to be a police officer.

235
00:26:46,312 --> 00:26:48,026
The next Bajirao Singham -

236
00:26:48,172 --> 00:26:51,568
My talented, capable,
good son, Shaurya!

237
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:52,860
But no,

238
00:26:52,993 --> 00:26:56,068
he wants to leave his family
and his country for London!

239
00:26:56,213 --> 00:26:59,213
Dad, do you see
how overdramatic she is being?

240
00:26:59,338 --> 00:27:00,255
I'm going.

241
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,172
Did you see that?

242
00:27:01,255 --> 00:27:02,088
Hey...

243
00:27:02,213 --> 00:27:05,088
I'm talking to him,
and he's just walking off.

244
00:27:05,721 --> 00:27:07,255
Do you want my blood pressure pill?

245
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,922
You can have it.

246
00:27:09,005 --> 00:27:10,630
You are not any better.

247
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:13,047
You don't take care
of yourself these days.

248
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:17,130
Why are you directing
your anger at me?

249
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:21,213
It's so embarrassing.

250
00:27:21,297 --> 00:27:23,588
You saw how the whole party came
to a standstill.

251
00:27:23,668 --> 00:27:25,213
Why are you so angry?

252
00:27:25,338 --> 00:27:27,672
Honestly, if my dad were Singham,

253
00:27:27,755 --> 00:27:29,640
I'd totally take advantage of that.

254
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,463
But what an amazing
personality he has!

255
00:27:32,588 --> 00:27:34,755
Everyone became alert
the moment they saw him.

256
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:37,047
Oh hi, Uncle!

257
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:38,255
Hi!

258
00:27:39,255 --> 00:27:40,255
How?

259
00:27:40,588 --> 00:27:41,797
Dad? What?

260
00:27:41,877 --> 00:27:43,005
Knock?

261
00:27:49,922 --> 00:27:50,963
Sorry.

262
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:58,755
Actually, I shouldn't have
shown up the way I did,

263
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,255
both here and at your friend's party.

264
00:28:01,797 --> 00:28:03,505
I know you're all grown up now

265
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:05,797
and need your own space.

266
00:28:07,172 --> 00:28:08,172
But I hadn't seen you in so long,

267
00:28:08,252 --> 00:28:11,547
and you're leaving
in a couple of days,

268
00:28:12,445 --> 00:28:14,713
so I thought we could
spend some time together.

269
00:28:16,588 --> 00:28:18,505
But for now I'm right here dad

270
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:21,047
and you're always busy...

271
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:22,755
in saving the country.

272
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:25,797
That's why I wanted to surprise you.

273
00:28:26,675 --> 00:28:28,505
I thought you'd be happy, but...

274
00:28:29,463 --> 00:28:30,463
Sorry.

275
00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:34,547
It's okay, Dad.

276
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,088
So...

277
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,213
girlfriend?

278
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,047
Not exactly...

279
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,422
it's a situationship.

280
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:47,422
Situationship?

281
00:28:47,922 --> 00:28:48,838
What's that?

282
00:28:48,922 --> 00:28:50,755
It's pretty basic, Dad.

283
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,820
You know
what a relationship means, right?

284
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,088
- Yes.
- Good.

285
00:28:55,172 --> 00:28:56,380
In a relationship,

286
00:28:56,463 --> 00:28:58,838
two people are romantically involved
and committed.

287
00:28:58,922 --> 00:29:00,505
- Yes.
- But in a situationship,

288
00:29:00,585 --> 00:29:03,463
they aren't as committed.

289
00:29:03,547 --> 00:29:04,992
Then why are they even together?

290
00:29:05,072 --> 00:29:06,297
Because they want to be together.

291
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,172
So why aren't they committed?

292
00:29:07,252 --> 00:29:08,857
Because of the situation, Dad!

293
00:29:08,937 --> 00:29:10,630
And they want to not be committed

294
00:29:10,713 --> 00:29:12,922
but to be romantically involved
with each other.

295
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,547
I'll be damned.

296
00:29:19,569 --> 00:29:21,005
I have to say, Singham,

297
00:29:21,088 --> 00:29:24,130
Avni has put on the Ramleela play
on such a grand scale!

298
00:29:24,213 --> 00:29:26,338
It's an amazing concept.

299
00:29:26,422 --> 00:29:30,047
It wasn't something anyone
could have managed alone.

300
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:31,826
Have you had a chance to attend it?

301
00:29:31,906 --> 00:29:33,755
No, sir, I couldn't.

302
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:34,797
But I'll go in a day or two.

303
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,755
Please make sure to attend.

304
00:29:36,838 --> 00:29:40,130
Avni blamed me for your absence.

305
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,963
I met Shaurya there.
He's really grown up.

306
00:29:44,047 --> 00:29:45,130
Yes, sir.

307
00:29:45,213 --> 00:29:48,838
He's going to London
and has a girlfriend too.

308
00:29:48,922 --> 00:29:50,755
Oh, he's in a relationship?

309
00:29:50,838 --> 00:29:53,630
Not quite, sir. It's a situationship.

310
00:29:54,505 --> 00:29:55,755
What does that mean?

311
00:29:56,213 --> 00:29:58,838
Well, a situationship means...

312
00:29:59,494 --> 00:30:02,797
There's more commitment
in a relationship,

313
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,380
while in a situationship...

314
00:30:06,088 --> 00:30:07,047
Forget it, sir.

315
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:09,005
We won't understand
how kids think these days.

316
00:30:09,088 --> 00:30:12,047
No, no, Singham,
I've seen it on social media.

317
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:13,547
It's called ghosting.

318
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:14,880
- Ghosting?
- Yes.

319
00:30:14,963 --> 00:30:17,422
It's when a boy and a girl are talking
to each other,

320
00:30:17,505 --> 00:30:19,505
and one of them suddenly disappears.

321
00:30:19,588 --> 00:30:21,047
- One of them disappears?
- Yes.

322
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:22,588
And I've heard of another term,

323
00:30:22,672 --> 00:30:24,130
it's called benching.

324
00:30:24,213 --> 00:30:25,047
- Benching?
- Yes!

325
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:27,672
Benching means there's a girl

326
00:30:27,755 --> 00:30:29,088
and a boy who are in a relationship,

327
00:30:29,172 --> 00:30:31,630
but there's another
girl waiting on the bench.

328
00:30:31,713 --> 00:30:35,130
If the first girl leaves,
the second one steps in.

329
00:30:35,484 --> 00:30:37,844
Singham look at me,

330
00:30:37,924 --> 00:30:40,963
I'm still with the same
woman even after 30 years.

331
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,973
Our college days were great, sir.

332
00:30:43,053 --> 00:30:44,505
We didn't have mobile phones...

333
00:30:44,588 --> 00:30:45,838
Or cameras!

334
00:30:45,922 --> 00:30:48,755
Just imagine otherwise, Singham...

335
00:30:52,694 --> 00:30:55,672
By the way, your Shiva Squad made
headlines again.

336
00:30:55,755 --> 00:30:56,922
Congratulations!

337
00:30:57,002 --> 00:30:59,088
We didn't do it alone, sir.

338
00:30:59,172 --> 00:31:00,588
The credit goes to you.

339
00:31:01,382 --> 00:31:04,172
It's been two years since
we captured Omar, sir,

340
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:07,284
but it still feels like someone is

341
00:31:07,364 --> 00:31:09,206
managing his operations.

342
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:12,672
From what Omar mentioned,

343
00:31:13,463 --> 00:31:15,919
it seems he handed over his control
to someone else.

344
00:31:16,738 --> 00:31:17,744
I know, Singham.

345
00:31:18,763 --> 00:31:21,437
Our R&AW team there is also trying
to hunt him down.

346
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:24,538
Singham, did you gather
any information

347
00:31:24,618 --> 00:31:27,405
from the smugglers you arrested
when you raided that place?

348
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:28,405
No, sir.

349
00:31:28,671 --> 00:31:30,803
Our team is interrogating them,

350
00:31:30,883 --> 00:31:32,578
but we haven't made
any breakthroughs yet.

351
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,511
Did you personally interrogate them?

352
00:31:36,638 --> 00:31:37,634
No, sir.

353
00:31:37,988 --> 00:31:39,030
But I will, today.

354
00:31:50,487 --> 00:31:52,921
Hey... get them out.

355
00:32:00,217 --> 00:32:03,212
Why have you brought us here,
ma'am?

356
00:32:05,341 --> 00:32:06,879
You will find out soon enough.

357
00:32:21,921 --> 00:32:23,797
- Jai Hind, sir.
- Jai Hind, sir.

358
00:32:24,129 --> 00:32:25,296
Jai Hind.

359
00:32:27,337 --> 00:32:29,212
Since how many days have you
been interrogating them?

360
00:32:29,296 --> 00:32:30,462
It's been six days, sir.

361
00:32:31,212 --> 00:32:33,591
They keep claiming they are
from Tamil Nadu

362
00:32:33,671 --> 00:32:35,254
and know nothing.

363
00:32:35,337 --> 00:32:37,546
They were caught with drugs
worth 6,000 crores,

364
00:32:37,629 --> 00:32:39,171
yet they say they don't know anything.

365
00:32:39,587 --> 00:32:40,671
Hand it over.

366
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:44,629
Are you new here?

367
00:32:45,407 --> 00:32:48,379
Don't you know we don't use
our official guns for this?

368
00:32:49,921 --> 00:32:51,087
Give it

369
00:33:01,921 --> 00:33:03,775
So you don't know anything?

370
00:33:03,855 --> 00:33:04,921
No.

371
00:33:06,546 --> 00:33:07,504
Fine.

372
00:33:07,796 --> 00:33:08,962
Go.

373
00:33:11,879 --> 00:33:12,546
GO!

374
00:33:12,629 --> 00:33:13,587
- No, sir
- Please, sir!

375
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:14,629
Please sir.

376
00:33:14,709 --> 00:33:15,962
You will kill us.

377
00:33:16,046 --> 00:33:17,754
Why aren't you talking then?

378
00:33:18,254 --> 00:33:19,546
Who do you work for?

379
00:33:19,629 --> 00:33:21,212
If we squeal on him,

380
00:33:21,296 --> 00:33:23,754
he'll wipe out our families, sir.

381
00:33:24,004 --> 00:33:25,421
He's a ghost, sir.

382
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:29,129
No one has seen him.

383
00:33:29,212 --> 00:33:32,712
No one knows where he comes
from or where he goes.

384
00:33:32,796 --> 00:33:35,171
But if anyone tries to enquire

385
00:33:35,254 --> 00:33:37,129
about him ends up dead.

386
00:33:37,212 --> 00:33:41,212
We take responsibility
for protecting you and your family.

387
00:33:41,296 --> 00:33:43,046
You won't be able to save us, sir.

388
00:33:43,129 --> 00:33:45,462
Neither our families nor us.
Your entire force won't be enough

389
00:33:45,546 --> 00:33:47,796
He's a demon, sir.

390
00:33:49,796 --> 00:33:52,171
He doesn't come alone;

391
00:33:53,004 --> 00:33:56,254
he shows up with thousands.

392
00:33:57,629 --> 00:34:00,171
Danger... Danger Lanka!

393
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:02,546
What are you doing?

394
00:34:02,629 --> 00:34:04,504
Shut up!

395
00:34:04,587 --> 00:34:07,712
Do you really think
our families are still alive?

396
00:34:07,842 --> 00:34:10,207
No, he must have killed them

397
00:34:10,287 --> 00:34:12,087
the moment we were arrested.

398
00:34:12,171 --> 00:34:14,006
He is Death personified, sir.

399
00:34:14,086 --> 00:34:15,462
He is Death!

400
00:34:15,837 --> 00:34:18,796
Don't make the mistake
of underestimating him, Singham.

401
00:34:18,921 --> 00:34:20,629
He's a firestorm.

402
00:34:20,712 --> 00:34:22,800
He's known as Danger Lanka.

403
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,129
He is right.

404
00:34:24,212 --> 00:34:26,046
No one has ever seen him.

405
00:34:26,129 --> 00:34:28,921
But he has three main guys.

406
00:34:29,004 --> 00:34:30,129
Sarath,

407
00:34:30,587 --> 00:34:32,046
Ranga,

408
00:34:32,129 --> 00:34:33,421
and Biju.

409
00:34:34,171 --> 00:34:35,046
Where can I find these three?

410
00:34:35,129 --> 00:34:37,087
They aren't from Tamil Nadu;

411
00:34:37,212 --> 00:34:39,379
they're from Sri Lanka.

412
00:34:39,509 --> 00:34:42,629
In Madurai,
near the Meenakshi Temple,

413
00:34:53,546 --> 00:34:54,976
there's an astrologer named Iyenger.

414
00:34:55,056 --> 00:34:56,879
All three of them believe
in him without question.

415
00:34:56,962 --> 00:34:58,754
Since Devi Pooja is going to begin

416
00:34:58,834 --> 00:35:01,296
they will go to meet him

417
00:35:01,376 --> 00:35:03,149
They definitely will.

418
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:16,504
Who's the officer
in-charge of that area?

419
00:35:16,587 --> 00:35:18,029
Shakti Shetty.

420
00:35:18,456 --> 00:35:20,278
I'll be damned.

421
00:35:58,934 --> 00:36:00,254
Hey Officer,

422
00:36:00,337 --> 00:36:02,212
your fellow officers have already
gone down back there.

423
00:36:02,421 --> 00:36:03,671
The only reason we are not hurting you is
because you are a woman, otherwise...

424
00:36:03,754 --> 00:36:05,877
Shut up, you idiot.

425
00:36:05,957 --> 00:36:08,546
The reason you came into
this world was a woman,

426
00:36:08,629 --> 00:36:10,852
if you act smart

427
00:36:10,932 --> 00:36:13,876
then the reason you will leave
this world will also be a woman.

428
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:13,671
Yes, sir.

429
00:37:13,754 --> 00:37:15,046
I got those punks.

430
00:37:15,129 --> 00:37:16,296
Good.

431
00:37:16,379 --> 00:37:17,754
Bring all three of them here tomorrow.

432
00:37:17,879 --> 00:37:18,754
Okay, sir.

433
00:37:18,885 --> 00:37:22,171
And Shakti, just do as I said, okay?

434
00:37:22,296 --> 00:37:23,796
I want them alive.

435
00:37:23,921 --> 00:37:26,587
I've learned all of this
from you, sir.

436
00:37:26,796 --> 00:37:29,587
That's why I said
that I want them alive.

437
00:37:31,094 --> 00:37:32,337
Yes, sir.

438
00:37:33,379 --> 00:37:34,462
Shakti Ma'am!

439
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,004
Look who's here!

440
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:37,171
Hello, ma'am!

441
00:37:37,254 --> 00:37:39,087
Sneha! What are you doing here?!

442
00:37:39,171 --> 00:37:40,962
I came to visit the temple.

443
00:37:41,138 --> 00:37:43,379
I had no idea I'd run
into you all here.

444
00:37:43,462 --> 00:37:46,046
You made quite the entrance,
just like a hero -

445
00:37:46,126 --> 00:37:47,337
it was fantastic!

446
00:37:47,421 --> 00:37:49,296
Both of them are your biggest fans.

447
00:37:49,379 --> 00:37:51,879
Subbu keeps telling him
stories about you.

448
00:37:51,962 --> 00:37:52,754
Thank you.

449
00:37:52,834 --> 00:37:54,060
Ma'am, you should come over.

450
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,171
It's Kartik's birthday tomorrow.

451
00:37:55,254 --> 00:37:56,671
We'd be thrilled to have you.

452
00:37:56,837 --> 00:37:58,004
I'll definitely be there.

453
00:37:59,421 --> 00:38:00,587
- Hi!
- Hi!

454
00:38:04,922 --> 00:38:06,546
- Ravi, bring me a cup of coffee.
- Let's go

455
00:38:06,671 --> 00:38:07,504
Subbu!

456
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:11,087
Hey, Shetty,

457
00:38:11,921 --> 00:38:13,379
you have two options.

458
00:38:13,921 --> 00:38:15,129
Let us go,

459
00:38:15,629 --> 00:38:16,671
and you'll make so much money

460
00:38:16,754 --> 00:38:19,212
that there won't be enough space
in this police station to hold it all.

461
00:38:20,004 --> 00:38:21,462
And second option:

462
00:38:21,868 --> 00:38:23,962
You might end up with
no police station at all.

463
00:38:25,282 --> 00:38:26,865
You don't know him.

464
00:38:31,004 --> 00:38:32,379
Are you trying to threaten me?

465
00:38:32,462 --> 00:38:34,546
You are referring
to Danger Lanka, right?

466
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:36,421
Where is he?

467
00:38:37,962 --> 00:38:40,587
Tell him, the real "danger"

468
00:38:40,671 --> 00:38:41,837
is waiting for you.

469
00:38:41,921 --> 00:38:43,546
Every officer that wears
a uniform thinks

470
00:38:43,629 --> 00:38:44,546
they are Singham.

471
00:38:44,629 --> 00:38:47,796
Come on,

472
00:38:48,057 --> 00:38:50,629
he is our Guru.

473
00:38:51,132 --> 00:38:52,546
I am not Singham,

474
00:38:53,415 --> 00:38:55,344
I am Lady Singham.

475
00:38:57,455 --> 00:38:59,205
What place is this?

476
00:38:59,288 --> 00:39:01,497
Indeed, it's Ayodhya.

477
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,997
This is the birthplace of Lord Ram.

478
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,205
If he had chosen to only live
in this palace,

479
00:39:06,288 --> 00:39:08,497
Today it would just be known
as a king's palace.

480
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,205
A tourist spot.

481
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:14,038
This became Lord Ram's birthplace

482
00:39:14,122 --> 00:39:16,538
because he gave it up...

483
00:39:16,622 --> 00:39:18,372
for 14 long years.

484
00:39:19,261 --> 00:39:22,030
What made you want to eat
Pav Bhaji from Dadar today?

485
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,247
Reminds me of our date nights.

486
00:39:24,997 --> 00:39:27,330
- How did the show go?
- It was great.

487
00:39:27,413 --> 00:39:29,205
Tomorrow, all the drama will begin,

488
00:39:29,288 --> 00:39:31,288
That's what we are preparing for.

489
00:39:31,873 --> 00:39:33,372
Tomorrow in our Ramleela play,

490
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:36,110
Lord Ram will embark
on a 14-year exile.

491
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,747
Mother Sita will accompany him as well.

492
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:39,705
Such a beautiful love story, isn't it?

493
00:39:39,788 --> 00:39:41,122
Beautiful?

494
00:39:41,205 --> 00:39:44,622
Mom, don't you think
it's all dramatic?

495
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:46,205
Dramatic?

496
00:39:46,413 --> 00:39:47,372
Your generation
doesn't even understand

497
00:39:47,455 --> 00:39:49,497
the concept of true love.

498
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,788
What was that... situationship?

499
00:39:52,655 --> 00:39:53,830
Dad...

500
00:39:54,663 --> 00:39:56,997
But Mom, do you seriously think

501
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,955
Lord Ram went all the way
to Lanka just for Mother Sita?

502
00:40:00,038 --> 00:40:01,392
3,000 kilometers away?

503
00:40:01,472 --> 00:40:03,538
Of course, it's a fact.

504
00:40:03,705 --> 00:40:04,872
Fact.

505
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,830
So, if you ever get kidnapped by

506
00:40:07,913 --> 00:40:09,663
a character like Ravan...

507
00:40:09,913 --> 00:40:10,955
Dad, would you go...

508
00:40:11,038 --> 00:40:11,870
to save Mom?

509
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:13,122
Excuse me!

510
00:40:13,418 --> 00:40:15,788
Just Google the name
Bajirao Singham,

511
00:40:16,118 --> 00:40:18,372
and you'll know
what your Dad's capable of.

512
00:40:18,913 --> 00:40:21,580
He'll go anywhere
For the one he loves...

513
00:40:22,023 --> 00:40:23,663
and the one he hates.

514
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:25,537
Dialogue, Dad!

515
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:27,038
Nice.

516
00:40:30,411 --> 00:40:31,413
Ravan.

517
00:40:31,788 --> 00:40:34,955
Mom, I really think Ravan
is quite cool.

518
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:37,247
He makes me further believe

519
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:39,872
that Ramayan is a mythological story.

520
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,049
What are you looking at?

521
00:40:47,205 --> 00:40:49,288
Get ready; you have a meeting
with Singham Sir

522
00:40:49,372 --> 00:40:50,622
in Mumbai tomorrow.

523
00:40:50,702 --> 00:40:51,663
Seriously, you tell me,

524
00:40:51,743 --> 00:40:53,205
how could anyone possibly have
ten heads?

525
00:40:53,288 --> 00:40:55,872
There are still plenty of people
who think like you.

526
00:40:56,205 --> 00:40:58,455
Oh no, I'm going to be late!

527
00:40:58,538 --> 00:41:00,247
- What happened sir?
- My son's birthday just started

528
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:02,038
- Take care, alright?
- Okay sir.

529
00:41:03,288 --> 00:41:05,306
Ravan was a fearless warrior.

530
00:41:05,386 --> 00:41:06,497
What's going on?

531
00:41:06,957 --> 00:41:08,205
Check the main switch.

532
00:41:08,955 --> 00:41:11,580
Those ten heads symbolize

533
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:14,913
his knowledge and wisdom.

534
00:41:25,335 --> 00:41:26,705
Super powerful...

535
00:41:32,163 --> 00:41:33,372
Super knowledgeable...

536
00:41:34,833 --> 00:41:36,413
The invincible...

537
00:41:37,247 --> 00:41:38,372
Ravan!

538
00:42:00,098 --> 00:42:01,538
Call the control room

539
00:42:01,622 --> 00:42:03,054
- Close all the windows fast.
- Yes sir.

540
00:42:03,134 --> 00:42:04,080
Guns!

541
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,830
Pick up the phone ma'am.

542
00:44:03,678 --> 00:44:09,549
Please, sir. Please don't kill me,
sir. Please, sir, please.

543
00:45:12,069 --> 00:45:14,247
My husband saw you as his hero.

544
00:45:17,315 --> 00:45:19,691
He always told our son,

545
00:45:19,821 --> 00:45:23,100
"You should grow up
to be like Shakti ma'am."

546
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:27,607
Today is my son's birthday.

547
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:35,038
What do I say to my 4-year-old?

548
00:45:36,582 --> 00:45:39,788
He keeps asking, "Where is Dad?

549
00:45:40,163 --> 00:45:41,247
What's wrong with Dad?"

550
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:42,822
Where has my dad gone?

551
00:45:42,902 --> 00:45:44,468
What should I tell him?

552
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:51,288
You tell him...

553
00:45:53,036 --> 00:45:55,038
You tell my son,

554
00:45:55,864 --> 00:45:58,764
"Son, your dad is never coming back

555
00:45:58,844 --> 00:46:00,760
because I left him
there alone to die."

556
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:01,955
Just say that!

557
00:46:04,838 --> 00:46:06,497
Why...?

558
00:46:09,955 --> 00:46:14,247
It's alright, my dear;
this too will pass. Let's go.

559
00:47:16,288 --> 00:47:18,205
I'm sorry, sir. I let you down.

560
00:47:18,829 --> 00:47:20,205
No, Shakti.

561
00:47:20,933 --> 00:47:22,288
It's not your fault.

562
00:47:23,538 --> 00:47:24,788
I underestimated him,

563
00:47:24,872 --> 00:47:27,038
thinking he was just
an ordinary criminal.

564
00:47:27,735 --> 00:47:29,111
But he's much more than that.

565
00:47:29,191 --> 00:47:30,205
Sir.

566
00:47:30,288 --> 00:47:31,650
According to the intel,

567
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:35,247
all three of them were spotted
near Panaikulam, sir.

568
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:38,955
All the detainees we arrested came
from that same village.

569
00:47:39,538 --> 00:47:43,038
Sir, I think we should send
our forces there.

570
00:47:44,247 --> 00:47:47,802
Shakti, take your team

571
00:47:47,882 --> 00:47:49,330
and track them down.

572
00:47:50,052 --> 00:47:51,247
Sir, I...?

573
00:47:53,019 --> 00:47:55,205
Sir you still trust me?

574
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:58,872
Sir, I don't deserve your trust.

575
00:47:59,327 --> 00:48:01,913
You can never break my trust, Shakti.

576
00:48:02,455 --> 00:48:04,205
You're not just that officer's hero;

577
00:48:05,205 --> 00:48:06,622
you're my hero as well.

578
00:48:06,705 --> 00:48:08,205
You are my pride.

579
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:11,205
Every officer of Singham
is his pride.

580
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:15,747
History bears witness
that Singham has never lost.

581
00:48:16,554 --> 00:48:20,205
And Lady Singham
will never lose either.

582
00:48:22,256 --> 00:48:23,330
Yes sir.

583
00:48:24,307 --> 00:48:25,538
Go and get them.

584
00:48:26,413 --> 00:48:28,205
Bring them back alive if you can;

585
00:48:28,582 --> 00:48:30,747
if not, you have my permission.

586
00:48:32,352 --> 00:48:33,988
A lion instills fear,

587
00:48:35,259 --> 00:48:38,663
but a wounded lion causes destruction.

588
00:48:40,214 --> 00:48:41,997
That's my line.

589
00:48:42,134 --> 00:48:45,122
Everything I know,
I learned from you.

590
00:48:45,966 --> 00:48:47,398
What is Dharma?

591
00:48:47,478 --> 00:48:49,173
What defines a human's Karma?

592
00:48:49,253 --> 00:48:52,514
Dharma is that noble force worthy of
our unwavering commitment,

593
00:48:52,594 --> 00:48:56,205
while Karma is the guiding light
that leads us along its sacred path.

594
00:48:56,288 --> 00:48:59,118
The highest Dharma is the one
that courageously navigates

595
00:48:59,241 --> 00:49:00,497
the treacherous journey of truth.

596
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:02,754
And the true ideal is he
who stands undaunted

597
00:49:02,834 --> 00:49:05,292
in the face of adversity.

598
00:49:05,372 --> 00:49:06,808
How did the footage get deleted?

599
00:49:06,888 --> 00:49:08,409
I don't know, ma'am.
I can't figure it out either.

600
00:49:08,489 --> 00:49:10,095
There must be a backup
on the hard drive.

601
00:49:10,175 --> 00:49:11,413
The hard drive is missing too, ma'am.

602
00:49:11,497 --> 00:49:13,497
There must be some way
to retrieve the footage.

603
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:15,298
Unfortunately, no, ma'am.

604
00:49:15,378 --> 00:49:17,756
We'll have to go to
Rameshwaram and reshoot it.

605
00:49:17,836 --> 00:49:20,170
Ma'am, Gautam
and I can leave tomorrow.

606
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:23,913
No, you need to stay here
for the show flow.

607
00:49:24,622 --> 00:49:25,747
I'll go.

608
00:49:26,247 --> 00:49:27,455
I'll also come with you.

609
00:49:27,538 --> 00:49:28,848
Is it really necessary for you to go?

610
00:49:28,928 --> 00:49:30,015
I will have to go.

611
00:49:30,095 --> 00:49:31,336
So who will go with you?

612
00:49:31,416 --> 00:49:33,288
Mrigiya is coming with me

613
00:49:33,538 --> 00:49:36,122
but now I think I'll take
this fool also.

614
00:49:36,247 --> 00:49:37,205
No!

615
00:49:37,288 --> 00:49:38,622
No, no, no, Mom!

616
00:49:38,702 --> 00:49:40,205
I can't go with you.

617
00:49:40,288 --> 00:49:41,413
I have my last football match on Sunday.

618
00:49:41,497 --> 00:49:43,205
I can't miss that.
Please.

619
00:49:44,288 --> 00:49:45,851
You don't have time
for your mother, do you?

620
00:49:45,931 --> 00:49:48,455
Come on, get up and come inside
to help me pack.

621
00:49:48,538 --> 00:49:50,163
- Mom...
- Get up!

622
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:58,976
What's wrong, sir?

623
00:49:59,056 --> 00:50:00,913
Something doesn't feel right, Daya.

624
00:50:02,108 --> 00:50:04,955
Rameshwaram is just four hours
from Madurai,

625
00:50:05,684 --> 00:50:08,413
and you know what happened
in Madurai.

626
00:50:09,666 --> 00:50:13,205
The monster who can kill
15 police officers

627
00:50:13,621 --> 00:50:16,163
and burn down a police station...

628
00:50:17,496 --> 00:50:19,122
can do anything.

629
00:50:22,465 --> 00:50:24,080
We can't take him lightly.

630
00:50:25,723 --> 00:50:28,788
Do one thing, go with Avni.

631
00:50:28,872 --> 00:50:29,580
Yes, sir.

632
00:50:29,663 --> 00:50:31,497
Prakash did you find the bag?

633
00:50:31,577 --> 00:50:32,888
I can't find the big bag ma'am.

634
00:50:32,968 --> 00:50:34,677
Ok I'll have a look you take this inside.

635
00:50:34,757 --> 00:50:35,725
Avni,

636
00:50:36,247 --> 00:50:37,649
Daya will be going along with you.

637
00:50:37,729 --> 00:50:39,742
Daya? Why?

638
00:50:43,663 --> 00:50:45,747
You're worried because of what happened

639
00:50:46,151 --> 00:50:48,205
at Shakti's police station, right?

640
00:50:48,288 --> 00:50:50,288
Aren't you overthinking this, Singham?

641
00:50:50,372 --> 00:50:51,622
Avni, just do as I say.

642
00:50:52,247 --> 00:50:53,455
Take Daya with you.

643
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:56,497
Fine.

644
00:50:57,058 --> 00:50:58,163
Let's go, Daya.

645
00:50:59,023 --> 00:51:00,021
Sure, ma'am.

646
00:51:00,101 --> 00:51:01,903
I'll meet you at the airport
tomorrow morning.

647
00:51:01,983 --> 00:51:03,205
Okay.

648
00:51:06,455 --> 00:51:09,122
If there's any emergency
in Rameshwaram, call Satya.

649
00:51:09,497 --> 00:51:10,538
Yes, sir.

650
00:51:44,056 --> 00:51:46,580
A city in Maharashtra, Nashik.

651
00:51:46,663 --> 00:51:49,280
When you hear its name,
you might immediately think of the Shirdi temple

652
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,432
or the Trimbakeshwar temple -

653
00:51:50,512 --> 00:51:51,788
both significant religious sites.

654
00:51:51,872 --> 00:51:53,622
But nearby lies another location

655
00:51:53,702 --> 00:51:55,334
where a pivotal event unfolded,

656
00:51:55,414 --> 00:52:00,205
adding a new chapter to Lord Ram's
tale of bravery and Indian history.

657
00:52:00,288 --> 00:52:02,955
I'm referring to Panchvati.

658
00:52:03,372 --> 00:52:05,288
Do you know what happened here?

659
00:52:06,018 --> 00:52:07,416
This is where Mother Sita was abducted.

660
00:52:07,496 --> 00:52:09,501
No matter how beautiful
a forest may be,

661
00:52:09,581 --> 00:52:10,538
it remains a forest.

662
00:52:10,663 --> 00:52:13,205
Danger lurked at every step;
misfortune awaited at every turn.

663
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:15,580
Hunger, thirst, rain,

664
00:52:15,663 --> 00:52:17,163
and heat were merely
minor challenges,

665
00:52:17,247 --> 00:52:18,580
but little did they know

666
00:52:18,663 --> 00:52:20,669
that the real hardships were yet to come.

667
00:52:20,749 --> 00:52:21,580
Yes, ma'am.

668
00:52:21,663 --> 00:52:23,288
I've downloaded all the files.

669
00:52:23,372 --> 00:52:24,497
Great!

670
00:52:24,577 --> 00:52:26,812
I'll be back on tomorrow
afternoon's flight.

671
00:52:26,892 --> 00:52:29,008
- By the way, how's it going there?
- Good, ma'am.

672
00:52:29,088 --> 00:52:31,497
We're about to start the act
of Mother Sita's abduction.

673
00:52:31,872 --> 00:52:33,205
I wish I was there.

674
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:34,622
All the best!

675
00:52:35,882 --> 00:52:38,455
The shimmering grace
of a deer so bright,

676
00:52:38,538 --> 00:52:40,697
Sparked Janaki's curiosity
with pure delight.

677
00:52:40,777 --> 00:52:43,884
"My Lord, what is that,
so beautiful and enchanting?"

678
00:52:43,964 --> 00:52:46,538
"Please bring it to me,
I immediately want it."

679
00:52:46,988 --> 00:52:49,414
But the deer's cry was not
what she found;

680
00:52:49,579 --> 00:52:52,751
It was Lord Ram's voice,
a plea that resound.

681
00:52:52,831 --> 00:52:54,794
To guard Mother Sita,

682
00:52:54,874 --> 00:52:56,199
Lakshman drew a protective line,

683
00:52:56,279 --> 00:52:58,247
Then rushed to the forest
without wasting any time.

684
00:53:00,788 --> 00:53:02,067
Yes, Mrigaya, where are you?

685
00:53:02,147 --> 00:53:03,826
- We're waiting.
- I'm sorry, ma'am,

686
00:53:03,906 --> 00:53:06,622
but my car broke down
behind the Kalaam House.

687
00:53:06,702 --> 00:53:09,455
Could you please send Daya here?

688
00:53:09,538 --> 00:53:10,622
Okay.

689
00:53:11,857 --> 00:53:13,696
Ma'am, Kalaam House isn't
far from here.

690
00:53:13,776 --> 00:53:14,759
- Bhaskar.
- Yes, sir.

691
00:53:14,839 --> 00:53:16,330
You stay here with Avni Ma'am.

692
00:53:16,413 --> 00:53:18,038
- We'll be back shortly.
- Sir.

693
00:53:19,782 --> 00:53:21,131
- Bhaskar
- Yes, ma'am.

694
00:53:21,266 --> 00:53:22,905
Could I get a hot cup of coffee?

695
00:53:23,036 --> 00:53:24,997
Why not, ma'am?
I'll go grab it right away.

696
00:53:44,455 --> 00:53:46,497
Avni Bajirao Singham.

697
00:53:46,997 --> 00:53:49,455
You work for
the cultural ministry, right?

698
00:53:49,538 --> 00:53:51,497
- Yes.
- Ramayan...

699
00:53:52,413 --> 00:53:54,538
I mean you are doing
the Ramleela Project.

700
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,121
I saw you on the news.

701
00:53:56,247 --> 00:53:58,872
Oh, okay.

702
00:53:59,455 --> 00:54:01,080
How's Singham Sir?

703
00:54:02,313 --> 00:54:03,622
You know him?

704
00:54:03,702 --> 00:54:05,288
Who doesn't know him?

705
00:54:07,116 --> 00:54:09,163
You must be very proud of him.

706
00:54:09,243 --> 00:54:10,455
Of course, I am.

707
00:54:11,516 --> 00:54:13,955
By the way, you are...?

708
00:54:14,038 --> 00:54:18,247
You could say I'm also committed
to my duties, just like your husband.

709
00:54:19,899 --> 00:54:22,955
But don't take this the wrong way, Avni;

710
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,997
Singham isn't that perfect either.

711
00:54:25,878 --> 00:54:29,955
Like anyone, he has flaws too.

712
00:54:31,538 --> 00:54:33,872
His biggest flaw

713
00:54:34,497 --> 00:54:38,247
is thinking only his viewpoint is valid.

714
00:54:38,913 --> 00:54:41,413
He's so proud of his honesty
and loyalty

715
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:48,663
that he often overlooks others' feelings.

716
00:54:49,538 --> 00:54:51,080
And you know what, Avni?

717
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:54,205
Sometimes, the arrogance of such 'clean'

718
00:54:54,288 --> 00:54:56,122
and morally correct people

719
00:54:56,955 --> 00:54:59,580
can lead to trouble
for their families.

720
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:05,205
By the way,
where are Daya and Mrigaya?

721
00:55:06,214 --> 00:55:09,122
Oh, did you think
Mrigaya works for you?

722
00:55:38,247 --> 00:55:40,372
There's no one here, sir.

723
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:17,765
Sir, I believe we've been misled.

724
00:56:17,845 --> 00:56:19,205
We've searched every corner
of Panaikulam,

725
00:56:19,285 --> 00:56:20,372
but we haven't found
those three here.

726
00:56:20,455 --> 00:56:22,497
You won't find them there;
it's a trap.

727
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:24,247
They've abducted Avni.

728
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:25,250
What?!

729
00:57:32,171 --> 00:57:34,463
Daya, break down the door!

730
01:00:18,994 --> 01:00:20,829
Well done, ma'am!

731
01:00:21,481 --> 01:00:22,860
You've been shot.

732
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:25,041
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

733
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:26,171
But...

734
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:31,088
Ma'am...

735
01:00:31,504 --> 01:00:32,713
She is my mother.

736
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:34,958
Our Kalari Ashram is nearby.

737
01:00:35,038 --> 01:00:36,171
Avni, are you alright?

738
01:00:36,714 --> 01:00:39,546
I'm fine, but he's been shot.

739
01:00:42,670 --> 01:00:45,336
Don't worry, he'll be fine.

740
01:00:46,865 --> 01:00:47,920
Let's go.

741
01:01:25,774 --> 01:01:27,982
Get him airlifted immediately.

742
01:01:28,778 --> 01:01:30,527
And you stay with him.

743
01:01:30,607 --> 01:01:31,649
Sir.

744
01:02:03,784 --> 01:02:06,568
Sir, we got a message
from Satya Sir over the wireless.

745
01:02:06,648 --> 01:02:08,399
Ma'am is with him.

746
01:02:20,603 --> 01:02:22,904
Your wound will heal in two days.

747
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,852
Why don't you take better
care of yourself?

748
01:02:24,993 --> 01:02:27,393
You keep getting scolded,
yet you still don't pay attention.

749
01:02:27,477 --> 01:02:29,393
What can I do, Revti Amma?

750
01:02:29,477 --> 01:02:31,060
My wounds crave your scolding more

751
01:02:31,143 --> 01:02:32,977
than this salve for healing.

752
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:34,560
I see.

753
01:02:35,092 --> 01:02:37,435
Since how long have you been
teaching Kalari?

754
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:38,872
Since I was a little girl.

755
01:02:39,006 --> 01:02:40,964
This ashram belongs to my father.

756
01:02:42,776 --> 01:02:45,381
That's why your son is brave,
just like you.

757
01:02:46,194 --> 01:02:49,256
Despite being shot he's still smiling

758
01:02:50,606 --> 01:02:54,798
Actually, I didn't give birth to Satya.

759
01:02:55,464 --> 01:02:56,423
What do you mean?

760
01:02:56,725 --> 01:02:58,669
Many years ago,

761
01:02:58,749 --> 01:03:00,621
our ashram's healer,

762
01:03:00,746 --> 01:03:03,214
Revti Amma,
was walking through a forest

763
01:03:04,006 --> 01:03:07,256
when she heard
a child's cry from afar.

764
01:03:07,339 --> 01:03:08,839
When she got closer,

765
01:03:08,923 --> 01:03:12,339
she saw the child had turned blue.

766
01:03:12,423 --> 01:03:14,839
Then she noticed a snake passing by.

767
01:03:16,268 --> 01:03:18,423
She picked up the child,

768
01:03:18,548 --> 01:03:21,923
and by a miracle,

769
01:03:22,081 --> 01:03:23,506
he was completely fine.

770
01:03:23,631 --> 01:03:25,256
Nothing happened to him.

771
01:03:25,783 --> 01:03:29,298
She brought him back to this ashram.

772
01:03:29,441 --> 01:03:34,298
Since then, countless miraculous
events have occurred with Satya

773
01:03:34,961 --> 01:03:37,381
that you wouldn't believe them.

774
01:03:37,464 --> 01:03:42,214
I truly believe he is under
the protection of Lord Shiva.

775
01:03:44,923 --> 01:03:46,203
Are you alright?

776
01:03:46,283 --> 01:03:47,381
Yes, ma'am.

777
01:03:48,052 --> 01:03:49,666
By the way, who were those people?

778
01:03:49,746 --> 01:03:50,881
I have no idea.

779
01:03:51,464 --> 01:03:53,798
All I know is that whoever he is,

780
01:03:54,315 --> 01:03:55,693
he's after Singham.

781
01:03:57,156 --> 01:04:00,123
He put a lot of thought
into this plan.

782
01:04:00,298 --> 01:04:02,756
My assistant Mrigaya works
for him too...

783
01:04:07,041 --> 01:04:08,798
Singham was right about it

784
01:04:09,954 --> 01:04:11,668
I just hope Daya is fine.

785
01:04:11,819 --> 01:04:13,165
If you wouldn't have come...

786
01:04:13,245 --> 01:04:14,994
How could I not, ma'am?

787
01:04:15,167 --> 01:04:17,673
He idolizes Singham Sir, Avni.

788
01:04:17,989 --> 01:04:19,048
It has always been his dream

789
01:04:19,131 --> 01:04:21,673
to work alongside him as his Lakshman.

790
01:04:24,052 --> 01:04:25,381
Looks like Singham Sir is here.

791
01:08:36,114 --> 01:08:37,533
Satya!

792
01:10:20,433 --> 01:10:21,796
Satya!

793
01:10:33,648 --> 01:10:35,314
Satya!

794
01:12:48,052 --> 01:12:52,605
Sir, we've deployed our forces
in Rameshwaram and at nearby exit points.

795
01:12:52,749 --> 01:12:54,887
We've also alerted all check posts.

796
01:12:54,967 --> 01:12:56,951
Our teams are already stationed

797
01:12:57,031 --> 01:12:59,293
at all the hospitals in the area.

798
01:12:59,373 --> 01:13:01,408
There's only one way out of here, sir.

799
01:13:01,488 --> 01:13:03,756
It leads to Madurai via Sivganga.

800
01:13:04,470 --> 01:13:05,887
Shakti's already on it, sir.

801
01:13:05,967 --> 01:13:07,853
I've informed her.

802
01:13:08,770 --> 01:13:10,684
I'm really sorry
I couldn't stop him, sir.

803
01:13:12,249 --> 01:13:13,839
I hope Avni Ma'am is okay.

804
01:13:20,317 --> 01:13:21,839
Avni will be fine.

805
01:13:23,422 --> 01:13:24,423
Don't worry.

806
01:13:25,251 --> 01:13:26,339
Let's go.

807
01:13:32,161 --> 01:13:34,381
- Hello?
- Hello, Singham.

808
01:13:34,461 --> 01:13:35,631
How are you?

809
01:13:37,682 --> 01:13:39,589
You're searching for
Danger Lanka, right?

810
01:13:40,259 --> 01:13:42,683
Danger Lanka is a name given
to me by the people.

811
01:13:43,904 --> 01:13:46,218
Do you want to know
who I really am?

812
01:13:46,344 --> 01:13:48,925
Remember when Omar Hafiz said

813
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:52,134
that this war is the sole purpose
of his lineage?

814
01:13:52,217 --> 01:13:54,217
I'm the firestorm he referred to,
Singham.

815
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:59,175
I'm Zubair Hafiz,
Omar Hafiz's grandson.

816
01:14:05,734 --> 01:14:09,009
Uncle Raza and I spent
the best years of

817
01:14:09,092 --> 01:14:10,800
our lives at London University.

818
01:14:10,884 --> 01:14:12,342
And now you're heading there
to study as well.

819
01:14:12,425 --> 01:14:14,884
Anyways a lot is about to happen here.

820
01:14:16,467 --> 01:14:18,175
If anything happens to me,

821
01:14:18,259 --> 01:14:21,175
know that you have inherited
my fire for revenge.

822
01:14:21,259 --> 01:14:23,217
I won't let anything happen
to you, Grandpa.

823
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:27,092
You'll witness our revenge succeed
with your own eyes.

824
01:14:27,175 --> 01:14:28,717
I promise.

825
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:42,884
I am the Ravan of your story.

826
01:14:42,967 --> 01:14:45,467
I know Avni is hurt,

827
01:14:46,164 --> 01:14:50,134
but you should be more concerned
about her life than I am.

828
01:14:50,537 --> 01:14:52,879
Because if something happens to her,

829
01:14:53,425 --> 01:14:57,259
your time will start ticking down.

830
01:14:57,342 --> 01:14:59,092
I've heard so much about you.

831
01:14:59,217 --> 01:15:01,762
Singham this, Singham that.

832
01:15:01,842 --> 01:15:03,384
Singham is a warrior.

833
01:15:03,464 --> 01:15:05,467
He's the embodiment of loyalty.

834
01:15:06,342 --> 01:15:09,467
He follows the principles of Lord Ram.

835
01:15:09,550 --> 01:15:13,050
If you truly are Lord Ram's disciple
in this Kalyug,

836
01:15:13,134 --> 01:15:17,300
bring your officers Simmba
and Sooryavanshi along with my grandfather

837
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:20,592
and come get your wife.

838
01:15:20,675 --> 01:15:22,967
I swear on my mother, Zubair,

839
01:15:23,050 --> 01:15:25,800
if I don't come for Avni,

840
01:15:25,884 --> 01:15:28,634
then Singham is not a true Maratha!

841
01:16:05,234 --> 01:16:06,942
She's out of danger now.

842
01:16:08,525 --> 01:16:10,817
Zubair, she's out of danger.

843
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:37,775
I've waited two years

844
01:16:37,859 --> 01:16:40,650
to see you in this state.

845
01:16:40,734 --> 01:16:42,984
I'm proud of my grandson.

846
01:16:43,067 --> 01:16:45,734
If he were a real man,
he would have come at me directly.

847
01:16:46,234 --> 01:16:48,942
Did you really think you
and your grandson will be spared

848
01:16:49,025 --> 01:16:51,192
after using an innocent
woman as a shield?

849
01:16:51,275 --> 01:16:53,609
This is war, Singham.

850
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:56,192
And everything is fair in war.

851
01:16:56,275 --> 01:16:59,150
You know Genghis Khan, don't you?

852
01:16:59,230 --> 01:17:00,984
He once declared,

853
01:17:01,067 --> 01:17:06,150
"I am the punishment of God."

854
01:17:06,234 --> 01:17:11,692
Zubair is that punishment,
for you and your friends.

855
01:17:11,775 --> 01:17:14,859
You don't know Bajirao Singham.

856
01:17:14,942 --> 01:17:18,150
Bajirao has taken
only two vows in his life.

857
01:17:18,230 --> 01:17:20,192
The first, when he put on his uniform:

858
01:17:20,275 --> 01:17:23,359
To serve his country
until his last breath.

859
01:17:23,442 --> 01:17:26,275
The second, when he married Avni:

860
01:17:26,359 --> 01:17:28,609
To always protect her.

861
01:17:29,817 --> 01:17:32,400
Today, I make a third vow.

862
01:17:32,484 --> 01:17:35,275
If my wife is harmed in any way,

863
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:37,359
you won't receive
your grandson's corpse,

864
01:17:37,442 --> 01:17:40,359
just like you didn't receive your sons.

865
01:17:44,150 --> 01:17:46,192
He's a firestorm.

866
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:49,567
Everyone's going to die.

867
01:17:51,234 --> 01:17:53,525
I should have gone with Mom.

868
01:17:53,609 --> 01:17:55,442
Your mom will be fine.

869
01:17:57,861 --> 01:18:01,192
He's been planning this for two years
while hiding out in Tamil Nadu,

870
01:18:01,275 --> 01:18:03,525
and our team didn't even
catch a whiff of it?

871
01:18:03,609 --> 01:18:05,192
We have to admit, Singham,

872
01:18:05,275 --> 01:18:09,025
this is the biggest failure of
our intelligence network.

873
01:18:09,109 --> 01:18:11,775
No matter which corner
of India Zubair hides in,

874
01:18:11,859 --> 01:18:13,942
we won't let him go unpunished.

875
01:18:14,025 --> 01:18:18,234
We will deploy our entire force
and all our resources to find Avni.

876
01:18:18,372 --> 01:18:21,650
Sir, he has also demanded for
the three of us along with Omar.

877
01:18:21,775 --> 01:18:24,400
He's executed
this plan very intelligently.

878
01:18:24,484 --> 01:18:27,192
I'm certain he won't make
the mistake of staying in India.

879
01:18:27,275 --> 01:18:30,525
I believe he's on his way
to Sri Lanka.

880
01:19:04,609 --> 01:19:05,567
Sir...

881
01:19:06,859 --> 01:19:08,567
Come what may,

882
01:19:08,650 --> 01:19:09,984
we'll continue with the Ramleela play.

883
01:19:10,067 --> 01:19:11,609
We'll all make Mom proud.

884
01:19:23,485 --> 01:19:24,900
Connect.

885
01:19:25,942 --> 01:19:28,234
So when are you three bringing
my grandfather?

886
01:19:28,314 --> 01:19:29,692
First, tell me where I need to come

887
01:19:29,775 --> 01:19:31,484
I'll let you know, Singham.

888
01:19:31,567 --> 01:19:35,154
Just arrange for
my grandfather's release for now.

889
01:19:35,234 --> 01:19:38,107
None of your demands will be met

890
01:19:38,234 --> 01:19:39,817
until I'm sure Avni is safe.

891
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:44,609
Your wife's life could be in danger
if you don't do as I say.

892
01:19:48,017 --> 01:19:50,067
If anything happens to my wife,

893
01:19:50,525 --> 01:19:52,859
I'll behead your grandfather

894
01:19:53,397 --> 01:19:55,067
and hang his head on the Red Fort.

895
01:19:55,150 --> 01:19:57,897
Whoa! Someone's really angry!

896
01:19:57,977 --> 01:20:00,029
But you have a good reason to be angry.

897
01:20:00,109 --> 01:20:01,984
It's a family matter, after all.

898
01:20:02,942 --> 01:20:05,307
And who would understand
that better than us, right?

899
01:20:05,387 --> 01:20:07,817
First, I'll come alone to see Avni.

900
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:09,442
Singham, you know if you come here,

901
01:20:09,525 --> 01:20:11,609
you won't make it out alive.

902
01:20:12,192 --> 01:20:15,192
And then your government
won't let my grandfather go.

903
01:20:15,465 --> 01:20:17,067
Let's do one thing.

904
01:20:17,150 --> 01:20:19,609
Send your favourite

905
01:20:20,427 --> 01:20:22,609
to check if Avni is alright.

906
01:20:24,579 --> 01:20:26,192
Who's he talking about sir?

907
01:20:44,072 --> 01:20:47,701
POLICE!

908
01:23:10,109 --> 01:23:12,109
You can say no if you want.

909
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:14,234
This isn't an official mission;

910
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:15,692
it's personal.

911
01:23:15,772 --> 01:23:16,984
Personal?

912
01:23:17,817 --> 01:23:19,359
So am I just "impersonal"?

913
01:23:19,442 --> 01:23:20,317
Do I mean nothing to you?

914
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,109
Does your wife mean nothing to me?

915
01:23:23,025 --> 01:23:24,567
You hurt my feelings, sir.

916
01:23:26,525 --> 01:23:28,109
It's not like that, Simmba.

917
01:23:30,484 --> 01:23:31,817
I don't think it's fair.

918
01:23:33,318 --> 01:23:35,984
I'll be putting your life at risk
to save Avni.

919
01:23:36,859 --> 01:23:38,084
It's a dangerous mission.

920
01:23:38,164 --> 01:23:39,775
So what?

921
01:23:39,859 --> 01:23:40,817
I'm dangerous too!

922
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:42,817
You're the Super Cop;
I'm the Robo Cop.

923
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:44,817
We are the Lethal Weapon, sir.

924
01:23:45,007 --> 01:23:46,650
Don't you think you're speaking
a bit too much English today?

925
01:23:46,734 --> 01:23:50,650
Yes, because you are emotionally
damage me, sir.

926
01:23:50,775 --> 01:23:52,817
Personal, huh?
Personal!

927
01:23:54,692 --> 01:23:56,192
Alright, don't be upset.

928
01:23:57,692 --> 01:23:59,067
But I have one request:

929
01:24:00,650 --> 01:24:02,025
Cut down on the English.

930
01:24:05,067 --> 01:24:08,900
This is the first time Simmba
has a chance to help Singham, sir.

931
01:24:08,984 --> 01:24:11,859
From giving my life to taking one,

932
01:24:11,942 --> 01:24:13,900
whatever the task is, consider it done.

933
01:24:15,359 --> 01:24:16,484
Sorry.

934
01:24:17,650 --> 01:24:18,900
Be careful.

935
01:24:20,573 --> 01:24:22,234
He seems like a maniac.

936
01:24:22,859 --> 01:24:23,984
We'll see, sir.

937
01:24:41,859 --> 01:24:43,405
Hampi, Karnataka

938
01:24:43,485 --> 01:24:47,484
where ancient temples still bear
witness to the Monkey Gods.

939
01:24:47,609 --> 01:24:48,900
Do you know why?

940
01:24:48,984 --> 01:24:50,525
Because the Hampi
we recognize today

941
01:24:50,609 --> 01:24:52,366
was once known as Kishkindha
in the Treta Yuga, the Silver Age,

942
01:24:52,446 --> 01:24:54,900
a realm ruled by the Monkey Kings Bali
and Sugriva.

943
01:24:54,984 --> 01:24:58,359
Not far from there lies one
of India's five sacred lakes,

944
01:24:58,442 --> 01:24:59,609
Pampa Sarovar,

945
01:24:59,692 --> 01:25:00,900
where Lord Ram

946
01:25:00,984 --> 01:25:03,317
and Lord Hanuman met for the first time,

947
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:07,567
marking the beginning of
a new chapter of courage and valor.

948
01:25:08,150 --> 01:25:09,775
The word has spread through the jungle

949
01:25:09,859 --> 01:25:13,192
that Simmba has arrived
to support the Lion.

950
01:25:13,734 --> 01:25:15,984
Singham, his flight departs tomorrow.

951
01:25:16,067 --> 01:25:18,234
Make sure Simmba catches it.

952
01:25:19,192 --> 01:25:22,609
My men will be waiting
for him at the airport here.

953
01:25:22,692 --> 01:25:24,025
Colombo.

954
01:25:25,102 --> 01:25:27,752
Columbus! Columbus! Columbus!

955
01:25:27,832 --> 01:25:29,337
Where's Columbus, ma'am?
Isn't it in America?

956
01:25:29,417 --> 01:25:30,206
It's going to be a long flight, right?

957
01:25:30,286 --> 01:25:31,401
Boss, I prefer traveling
in business class.

958
01:25:31,481 --> 01:25:33,463
My legs start tingling in economy.

959
01:25:33,543 --> 01:25:34,997
It's not Columbus; it's Colombo.

960
01:25:35,077 --> 01:25:36,628
Colombo is in Sri Lanka.

961
01:25:37,859 --> 01:25:40,109
Ah, I see - our neighboring country,

962
01:25:40,192 --> 01:25:41,817
the one to the south.

963
01:25:41,900 --> 01:25:42,854
Alright then,

964
01:25:42,934 --> 01:25:45,192
let's head to Sri Lanka
and have some fun.

965
01:25:45,272 --> 01:25:48,025
Activate all our agents in Sri Lanka.

966
01:25:48,109 --> 01:25:49,150
Yes, sir.

967
01:25:55,067 --> 01:25:56,109
Yes, sir.

968
01:26:08,408 --> 01:26:09,317
Yeah, okay.

969
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:10,567
- Share the details please.
- Yes, ma'am.

970
01:26:10,650 --> 01:26:11,317
- Dilip?
- Yes, ma'am?

971
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:12,840
- Crosscheck the coordinates.
- Sure ma'am.

972
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:14,416
Ma'am, it'll take me two
and a half hours to get to Colombo.

973
01:26:14,496 --> 01:26:16,192
So, what's the plan after that?

974
01:26:16,317 --> 01:26:18,525
Simmba, I suspect that as soon
as you touch down,

975
01:26:18,609 --> 01:26:20,998
Zubair's men will grab you
and throw you into a car.

976
01:26:21,078 --> 01:26:22,484
How can you say that, ma'am?

977
01:26:22,567 --> 01:26:23,400
"Grab you and throw you"?

978
01:26:23,484 --> 01:26:25,359
What am I? A checked-in bag?

979
01:26:25,442 --> 01:26:26,650
Hey, it's not my plan.

980
01:26:26,734 --> 01:26:27,859
But it could be Zubair's.

981
01:26:27,942 --> 01:26:29,566
What do you mean "it could be"?

982
01:26:29,646 --> 01:26:31,317
If Zubair wants Omar,

983
01:26:31,984 --> 01:26:34,109
he'll definitely take you to Avni.

984
01:26:34,734 --> 01:26:36,650
And through your location,

985
01:26:37,146 --> 01:26:38,317
we will be able track her down.

986
01:26:38,999 --> 01:26:40,012
Sir.

987
01:26:40,092 --> 01:26:42,067
Here's the live feed
from Colombo Airport.

988
01:26:42,484 --> 01:26:44,150
Our satellites will keep tabs

989
01:26:45,150 --> 01:26:46,609
on you every moment from here.

990
01:26:48,105 --> 01:26:49,057
Technology!

991
01:26:49,137 --> 01:26:51,234
India's intel is
at a James Bond level, right?

992
01:26:51,314 --> 01:26:54,109
Self-reliant India!
Mind is blowing!

993
01:26:54,525 --> 01:26:55,916
Boss, I have a doubt.

994
01:26:55,996 --> 01:26:57,650
If I need to make an emergency call

995
01:26:57,734 --> 01:26:59,359
and the Aunty managing
the satellite says,

996
01:26:59,442 --> 01:27:01,155
"Singham is busy on another call,"

997
01:27:01,275 --> 01:27:03,859
then Zubair will have me
done for, right?

998
01:27:03,942 --> 01:27:04,859
Don't worry, Simmba.

999
01:27:04,942 --> 01:27:08,775
Singham Sir will be in Negombo
by the time you land in Colombo.

1000
01:27:09,025 --> 01:27:09,942
Sir, our coast guard will drop

1001
01:27:10,025 --> 01:27:12,609
you off on a trawler near
the Sri Lankan border

1002
01:27:12,692 --> 01:27:13,775
which is arranged by our team.

1003
01:27:13,859 --> 01:27:15,445
And you'll reach Negombo

1004
01:27:15,525 --> 01:27:18,192
where our R&AW agents
will be waiting for you.

1005
01:27:18,557 --> 01:27:21,984
So, that's the game plan.

1006
01:27:23,275 --> 01:27:27,567
And where's the player?

1007
01:27:29,275 --> 01:27:30,889
You'll find out when the time is right.

1008
01:27:33,109 --> 01:27:35,317
Sir, do you believe just
the three of us can pull this off?

1009
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:37,984
Who said it's only the three of us?

1010
01:27:39,820 --> 01:27:41,192
No, Singham.

1011
01:27:42,545 --> 01:27:43,880
This doesn't feel right.

1012
01:27:44,984 --> 01:27:47,900
This is a suicide mission.

1013
01:27:48,729 --> 01:27:52,192
Let me consult the
Sri Lankan government first.

1014
01:27:52,310 --> 01:27:53,609
No, sir.

1015
01:27:53,775 --> 01:27:55,150
Zubair is quite shrewd.

1016
01:27:55,984 --> 01:27:57,442
If he discovers that

1017
01:27:57,817 --> 01:28:00,359
the Sri Lankan government
is involved,

1018
01:28:00,442 --> 01:28:01,942
he'll escape.

1019
01:28:02,397 --> 01:28:03,900
This is our only chance
to capture him.

1020
01:28:03,984 --> 01:28:06,484
And Avni? What about her safety?

1021
01:28:07,817 --> 01:28:12,234
Zubair callously killed
15 police officers in Madurai, sir.

1022
01:28:12,775 --> 01:28:15,325
Their families will only find peace

1023
01:28:15,405 --> 01:28:17,442
after we get our revenge.

1024
01:28:18,328 --> 01:28:20,192
As for Avni,

1025
01:28:20,317 --> 01:28:22,525
had she been here,
she too would have said,

1026
01:28:22,817 --> 01:28:24,567
"I may die if I have to,

1027
01:28:24,734 --> 01:28:27,650
but India doesn't negotiate
with terrorists."

1028
01:28:28,067 --> 01:28:29,984
If we're meant to die,

1029
01:28:30,067 --> 01:28:31,692
then so be it.

1030
01:28:31,775 --> 01:28:33,817
But I swear we will take Zubair down.

1031
01:28:34,817 --> 01:28:37,067
So, it's just going
to be the three of you?

1032
01:28:37,150 --> 01:28:39,192
Isn't it a bit too dramatic for

1033
01:28:39,317 --> 01:28:40,817
only the three of us to go?

1034
01:28:41,442 --> 01:28:43,694
We'll need backup
from your other forces.

1035
01:28:43,774 --> 01:28:45,942
I'll need to get permission
from Sir.

1036
01:28:46,025 --> 01:28:48,109
We've already done
it twice before.

1037
01:28:48,790 --> 01:28:50,069
Let us invoke the blessing
of Lord Hanuman

1038
01:28:50,149 --> 01:28:52,025
and carry out this operation
a third time.

1039
01:29:01,609 --> 01:29:03,609
Why did you do this, Mrigaya?

1040
01:29:04,939 --> 01:29:06,192
For money?

1041
01:29:06,369 --> 01:29:07,132
Why?

1042
01:29:07,212 --> 01:29:08,972
Avni, her name isn't Mrigaya;

1043
01:29:09,052 --> 01:29:10,453
it's Iqra Hafiz.

1044
01:29:10,962 --> 01:29:12,224
She's my aunt.

1045
01:29:12,371 --> 01:29:15,900
Do you really think
we're doing this for money?

1046
01:29:17,057 --> 01:29:18,400
No, ma'am,

1047
01:29:19,112 --> 01:29:22,442
we're seeking revenge
for our family.

1048
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:25,400
Just so you know,

1049
01:29:25,790 --> 01:29:27,525
I'm Zubair Hafiz,

1050
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:30,442
the grandson of Omar Hafiz.

1051
01:29:31,484 --> 01:29:33,817
She is the widow of my uncle Raza,

1052
01:29:34,858 --> 01:29:38,067
who was killed
by your husband, Singham.

1053
01:29:39,458 --> 01:29:44,119
Bilal's sacrifice shouldn't go to waste.

1054
01:29:44,199 --> 01:29:45,275
Okay, Father.

1055
01:29:46,929 --> 01:29:48,234
You may eliminate us today,
but tomorrow,

1056
01:29:48,317 --> 01:29:49,942
a hundred more like us will rise.

1057
01:29:50,930 --> 01:29:54,609
Riyaaz and Raza
have both become martyrs.

1058
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:06,942
To be honest,

1059
01:30:07,022 --> 01:30:10,650
I was scared for a moment
when you were shot,

1060
01:30:11,186 --> 01:30:15,663
wondering what would happen
to my two years of planning.

1061
01:30:15,818 --> 01:30:17,067
But must say,

1062
01:30:18,028 --> 01:30:20,442
you are a very strong lady,

1063
01:30:21,422 --> 01:30:24,359
just like Sita from the Ramayan.

1064
01:30:27,053 --> 01:30:28,806
By the way, I find Ravan's

1065
01:30:28,886 --> 01:30:31,689
character in the Ramayan
to be the most interesting.

1066
01:30:32,994 --> 01:30:34,778
Because he had no interest in Ayodhya

1067
01:30:34,895 --> 01:30:36,653
and wasn't fighting for Dharma.

1068
01:30:37,718 --> 01:30:40,900
He only sought revenge
for his family.

1069
01:30:42,044 --> 01:30:43,900
And I'm doing the same.

1070
01:30:45,572 --> 01:30:47,481
I'm not sure if it's just a tale

1071
01:30:48,653 --> 01:30:50,067
or the truth,

1072
01:30:51,586 --> 01:30:53,051
but I read somewhere

1073
01:30:54,525 --> 01:30:58,525
that Ravan would return
in Kalyug, the age of darkness.

1074
01:30:59,016 --> 01:31:00,666
So here he is.

1075
01:31:01,373 --> 01:31:03,831
If Ravan has returned,
then Ram will also come

1076
01:31:03,948 --> 01:31:06,650
to rescue his Sita.

1077
01:31:07,231 --> 01:31:09,359
The only difference

1078
01:31:10,255 --> 01:31:14,125
this time is that Ravan
will emerge victorious.

1079
01:31:16,012 --> 01:31:18,525
No matter how many times
the Ramayan is rewritten,

1080
01:31:19,519 --> 01:31:21,466
Ram will always win.

1081
01:31:23,197 --> 01:31:25,300
This is Kalyug, Avni,
the age of darkness.

1082
01:31:25,877 --> 01:31:27,574
This time,
Ravan will triumph.

1083
01:31:27,654 --> 01:31:31,442
Truth always prevails,
no matter what time we live in.

1084
01:31:32,383 --> 01:31:33,692
We'll see.

1085
01:31:45,050 --> 01:31:46,683
Even if I don't return,

1086
01:31:46,763 --> 01:31:48,486
your mom definitely will.

1087
01:31:49,148 --> 01:31:51,692
Just Google the name
Bajirao Singham, Dad,

1088
01:31:52,137 --> 01:31:54,734
and you'll know
what my dad's capable of.

1089
01:31:54,817 --> 01:31:58,567
Not just Mom,
both of you have to return.

1090
01:31:59,129 --> 01:32:02,371
Because then Diwali won't hold
the same meaning

1091
01:32:02,487 --> 01:32:04,189
if Mother Sita returns without Lord Ram.

1092
01:32:13,444 --> 01:32:14,715
Dad...!

1093
01:32:16,875 --> 01:32:18,011
Jai Hind!

1094
01:32:21,230 --> 01:32:22,692
Jai Hind!

1095
01:33:25,025 --> 01:33:26,368
- Jai Hind, sir.
- Jai Hind!

1096
01:33:26,448 --> 01:33:29,057
We have three hours until
Simmba's plane lands.

1097
01:33:29,137 --> 01:33:31,904
and till then we need to secure
you in a safe location.

1098
01:33:31,984 --> 01:33:33,904
And the safest place

1099
01:33:33,984 --> 01:33:35,824
is Seetha Amman Kovil temple,

1100
01:33:36,725 --> 01:33:39,275
or Ashok Vatika,
as mentioned in the Ramayan.

1101
01:33:44,990 --> 01:33:48,611
They say Ravan held Mother Sita

1102
01:33:48,725 --> 01:33:51,656
captive over here for a year.

1103
01:34:10,534 --> 01:34:12,031
She is with us.

1104
01:34:13,162 --> 01:34:16,823
This is the only temple
in Sri Lanka dedicated to Mother Sita.

1105
01:34:16,906 --> 01:34:20,365
This is where Lord Hanuman first met
Mother Sita in Lanka.

1106
01:34:20,448 --> 01:34:23,073
Wherever Lord Hanuman stepped,

1107
01:34:23,156 --> 01:34:25,781
he left a footprint.

1108
01:34:25,865 --> 01:34:29,031
It is said that this is one
of those footprints.

1109
01:34:50,198 --> 01:34:52,406
Sir, Simmba has landed.

1110
01:35:27,765 --> 01:35:29,740
Sir, Simmba has landed in Colombo.

1111
01:35:29,823 --> 01:35:31,278
Satellite vision is perfect.

1112
01:35:31,358 --> 01:35:33,156
Send me Simmba's
location tracking details.

1113
01:35:33,236 --> 01:35:34,323
We'll follow his movements.

1114
01:35:34,403 --> 01:35:35,573
Right away, sir.

1115
01:35:47,281 --> 01:35:48,615
Why so serious?

1116
01:35:48,740 --> 01:35:49,781
What is name?

1117
01:36:07,156 --> 01:36:08,198
Like it?

1118
01:36:09,031 --> 01:36:10,156
Nice...

1119
01:36:13,781 --> 01:36:15,615
Hey! What the hell!

1120
01:36:15,740 --> 01:36:18,448
This is my first time in Sri Lanka!
Let me enjoy the scenery at least!

1121
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:28,865
Escort party is heading
towards Galle, sir.

1122
01:36:37,141 --> 01:36:41,073
You've got water, snacks, anything?

1123
01:36:41,198 --> 01:36:42,448
Seriously, nothing?

1124
01:36:50,156 --> 01:36:53,531
Just letting you know.
I'll ask you to stop when we cross a foodcourt.

1125
01:37:04,315 --> 01:37:05,490
Oh hello!

1126
01:37:38,744 --> 01:37:41,365
Oh my God,
which of these cars is Simmba's?

1127
01:37:41,448 --> 01:37:42,948
Quickly track the cars.

1128
01:37:43,031 --> 01:37:44,656
Jot down these coordinates.

1129
01:37:58,961 --> 01:38:00,711
Which car do we follow now, sir?

1130
01:38:00,791 --> 01:38:01,823
Hold.

1131
01:38:17,247 --> 01:38:19,656
And here we have Sigiriya Fort
in Sri Lanka.

1132
01:38:19,781 --> 01:38:20,740
When they did carbon dating on it,

1133
01:38:20,823 --> 01:38:23,948
they discovered it's not just historic
but a pre-historic site.

1134
01:38:24,031 --> 01:38:25,156
Ten thousand years ago,

1135
01:38:25,236 --> 01:38:27,824
there was just one empire here
of such grandeur,

1136
01:38:27,904 --> 01:38:29,540
and it was ruled by The one with ten heads -
Dashanan Lankesh.

1137
01:38:29,661 --> 01:38:34,240
This is also where Lord Hanuman was taken
after he was captured in Ashok Vatika.

1138
01:38:42,505 --> 01:38:44,031
Hey, you're messing up my look!

1139
01:38:44,115 --> 01:38:45,873
It's my favourite jacket.
I want it back.

1140
01:38:45,953 --> 01:38:47,406
You'll get it all back.
Let's head inside.

1141
01:38:47,531 --> 01:38:48,490
Come on.

1142
01:38:51,732 --> 01:38:54,031
Scared you!
I scared you, didn't I?

1143
01:38:56,009 --> 01:38:58,026
Hey, Sister-in-law!

1144
01:38:58,207 --> 01:38:59,198
Simmba?!

1145
01:38:59,483 --> 01:39:00,376
What are you doing here?

1146
01:39:00,456 --> 01:39:02,083
Don't worry about me;
just tell me how you are.

1147
01:39:02,163 --> 01:39:03,163
I'm fine, but you...

1148
01:39:03,247 --> 01:39:05,372
Singham Sir sent me here
to check on you.

1149
01:39:05,455 --> 01:39:06,247
Thank you, Sister-in-law!

1150
01:39:06,330 --> 01:39:09,288
Because of you, my empty passport
finally got stamped with a visa.

1151
01:39:10,830 --> 01:39:11,908
Look at that!

1152
01:39:11,988 --> 01:39:13,687
She got hit with a 9mm bullet

1153
01:39:13,767 --> 01:39:16,330
and still manages a 200-watt smile!

1154
01:39:17,371 --> 01:39:20,038
I hope they are feeding you well.

1155
01:39:21,305 --> 01:39:22,497
Who's that aunty?

1156
01:39:22,580 --> 01:39:23,538
Is she with them?

1157
01:39:24,955 --> 01:39:26,163
Hello, Aunty.

1158
01:39:26,580 --> 01:39:29,455
Greetings, ma'am... or whatever!

1159
01:39:31,872 --> 01:39:32,955
Don't worry...

1160
01:39:33,038 --> 01:39:34,497
Singham...

1161
01:39:34,705 --> 01:39:35,997
Singham...

1162
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:37,205
- Hey!
- What?

1163
01:39:37,285 --> 01:39:39,038
Alright, enough with the chit-chat.
Let's go!

1164
01:39:39,118 --> 01:39:40,288
Yes, let's move.

1165
01:39:40,372 --> 01:39:41,955
I hope you've set me up
in a separate room.

1166
01:39:42,038 --> 01:39:43,455
I'm not sharing with anyone.

1167
01:39:43,955 --> 01:39:45,872
Hey, by the way,
do you know Marathi?

1168
01:39:47,330 --> 01:39:49,205
- No.
- Aunty, what about you?

1169
01:39:49,690 --> 01:39:50,955
No?

1170
01:39:51,788 --> 01:39:54,997
Sister-in-law, big brother
and our team are here.

1171
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:56,716
Don't worry.

1172
01:39:56,796 --> 01:39:59,017
We're going to take them down.

1173
01:40:04,344 --> 01:40:06,497
Jai Maharashtra!

1174
01:40:16,747 --> 01:40:18,335
Singham's devoted follower,

1175
01:40:18,588 --> 01:40:23,622
Sangram Bhalerao, aka Simmba!

1176
01:40:24,997 --> 01:40:28,372
Every kid's favorite in Shivgadh.

1177
01:40:28,452 --> 01:40:30,401
Tell me something I don't already know!

1178
01:40:30,538 --> 01:40:32,622
Tell me something I don't know!

1179
01:40:32,705 --> 01:40:35,288
No longer just a local legend,
I've gone national.

1180
01:40:35,372 --> 01:40:36,872
Not just the kids in Shivgadh;

1181
01:40:36,955 --> 01:40:42,622
Simmba's a favorite among every child
in India now!

1182
01:40:42,705 --> 01:40:46,413
Wow! Gabbar Singh!

1183
01:40:46,497 --> 01:40:48,372
You've got a dangerous look, Danger.

1184
01:40:48,455 --> 01:40:50,705
You look like a hero straight
out of a South Indian movie.

1185
01:40:50,788 --> 01:40:52,955
You were my favorite too

1186
01:40:53,038 --> 01:40:57,580
when you thought duty
and responsibility were just jokes

1187
01:40:57,663 --> 01:41:00,056
and all you cared about was money.

1188
01:41:00,136 --> 01:41:01,330
Hmm.

1189
01:41:01,413 --> 01:41:02,872
What changed, Simmba?

1190
01:41:10,038 --> 01:41:11,830
Life taught me that

1191
01:41:13,318 --> 01:41:16,038
relationships and duty are more
important than money.

1192
01:41:16,122 --> 01:41:18,330
And revenge's even more important!

1193
01:41:19,125 --> 01:41:22,288
Here, concepts of right and wrong,
good and bad don't really matter.

1194
01:41:22,872 --> 01:41:25,830
What you desire is what truly matters.

1195
01:41:25,997 --> 01:41:30,205
By the way, when did a corrupt guy

1196
01:41:30,729 --> 01:41:32,872
who'd accept bribe start dressing
like a stand-up citizen?

1197
01:41:32,955 --> 01:41:34,203
There you go!

1198
01:41:34,283 --> 01:41:35,985
If I wear clothes, it's a problem;

1199
01:41:36,065 --> 01:41:37,746
if I don't, that's also a problem.

1200
01:41:37,826 --> 01:41:40,455
I don't know what to do!

1201
01:41:40,901 --> 01:41:42,747
Zubair, you're really --

1202
01:41:46,150 --> 01:41:47,955
Attitude, huh?

1203
01:41:52,249 --> 01:41:54,872
I've checked your history too.

1204
01:41:55,163 --> 01:41:56,497
Raised in London,

1205
01:41:56,580 --> 01:42:00,163
not religious,
no jihad connections.

1206
01:42:00,288 --> 01:42:01,580
So what changed?

1207
01:42:01,705 --> 01:42:03,705
Why did you join the family business?

1208
01:42:05,663 --> 01:42:08,663
When a family's destiny
is written in blood,

1209
01:42:10,020 --> 01:42:12,622
the heir has no choice
but to take up the sword.

1210
01:42:12,705 --> 01:42:18,080
Ah, so Lanka's out for revenge
for his family, huh?

1211
01:42:19,038 --> 01:42:22,622
But sorry for inconvenience you, bro,

1212
01:42:23,037 --> 01:42:26,580
this time neither you nor
your terrorist grandpa are walking away.

1213
01:42:26,663 --> 01:42:29,283
You have no clue what's coming.

1214
01:42:29,363 --> 01:42:32,747
Why? Is Singham coming to save you?

1215
01:42:32,830 --> 01:42:35,413
Singham isn't coming;

1216
01:42:35,497 --> 01:42:38,288
he's already here.

1217
01:42:38,981 --> 01:42:41,955
Hey, builder, open the gate

1218
01:42:42,098 --> 01:42:44,497
and let Singham Sir
in before it's too late.

1219
01:42:47,663 --> 01:42:49,288
No one's here.

1220
01:42:50,951 --> 01:42:52,705
What do you mean, no one's here?
Check again.

1221
01:42:52,788 --> 01:42:54,122
Told you, no one's here.

1222
01:42:54,205 --> 01:42:55,747
As if you can see that from here!

1223
01:42:56,705 --> 01:42:58,122
I'll go take a look.

1224
01:43:02,117 --> 01:43:05,538
Looks like I am about
to get whacked on my back.

1225
01:43:06,548 --> 01:43:08,335
He promised me he'd show up.

1226
01:43:08,415 --> 01:43:09,830
What did Singham Sir say?

1227
01:43:09,913 --> 01:43:11,288
"Who said it's only the three of us?"

1228
01:43:11,413 --> 01:43:13,372
Forget three;
not even one of them is here.

1229
01:43:13,505 --> 01:43:15,955
I told them they'd use
a satellite jammer,

1230
01:43:16,038 --> 01:43:18,372
but they never listen to Simmba!

1231
01:43:18,700 --> 01:43:20,391
Our intel officer, Devika keeps saying,

1232
01:43:20,515 --> 01:43:23,538
"Yes, sir. Singham Sir. Okay, sir.
Whatever you want, sir."

1233
01:43:23,983 --> 01:43:26,413
Wants revenge from Singham , is
Sooryavanshi's enemy,

1234
01:43:26,497 --> 01:43:29,038
but guess who's the one in danger?
Simmba!

1235
01:43:29,205 --> 01:43:30,371
Why did you say no one's here?

1236
01:43:30,451 --> 01:43:32,413
- Because no one's here.
- So what?

1237
01:43:32,577 --> 01:43:34,038
Hey! Hey he ran away...

1238
01:43:34,934 --> 01:43:35,912
Hey, sorry, sorry!

1239
01:43:35,992 --> 01:43:37,455
No, I was just... You...

1240
01:44:29,748 --> 01:44:30,765
Ma'am.

1241
01:44:34,228 --> 01:44:35,838
Oh, my God, quickly connect with sir

1242
01:44:38,902 --> 01:44:41,580
Sir, I spot an explosion
at Galle harbour

1243
01:44:42,063 --> 01:44:43,955
and I'm damn sure it's Simmba.

1244
01:45:46,497 --> 01:45:47,799
Continue...Continue

1245
01:46:02,652 --> 01:46:03,788
This is Simmba's car.

1246
01:46:03,872 --> 01:46:05,372
I hope he's fine.

1247
01:46:05,567 --> 01:46:08,372
We should do a quick scan
of this area.

1248
01:46:08,452 --> 01:46:10,872
You all head that way,
and I'll check over here.

1249
01:47:13,413 --> 01:47:17,337
The only true powerhouse here
is Bajirao Singham!

1250
01:47:17,417 --> 01:47:18,619
Thank you.

1251
01:48:18,374 --> 01:48:19,372
What is this?

1252
01:48:19,826 --> 01:48:21,648
Sorry, Brother. Sorry, Sister.

1253
01:48:21,728 --> 01:48:23,372
Sorry for destruction.

1254
01:48:23,452 --> 01:48:25,807
You come India,

1255
01:48:25,887 --> 01:48:28,542
we give you two
holiday package free.

1256
01:48:28,622 --> 01:48:31,398
Kashmir to Kanyakumari,
where you say there we do take care.

1257
01:48:31,538 --> 01:48:32,608
A guest is akin to God.

1258
01:48:32,688 --> 01:48:36,497
Our policy:
God... our guest our God!

1259
01:48:37,913 --> 01:48:40,497
Avni?
Sister-in-law's fine. Don't worry.

1260
01:48:40,622 --> 01:48:41,788
She was shot here,

1261
01:48:41,872 --> 01:48:43,122
but she's getting treated
and will be fine.

1262
01:48:43,205 --> 01:48:44,830
She's out of danger.

1263
01:48:44,910 --> 01:48:46,163
Speaking of danger,

1264
01:48:46,247 --> 01:48:47,330
that Danger guy is really dangerous.

1265
01:48:47,413 --> 01:48:49,455
He's got a massive army out there.

1266
01:48:51,190 --> 01:48:52,622
- Come on.
- Let's go.

1267
01:48:52,788 --> 01:48:57,705
Sir, I promised them we'd cover
their holiday expenses.

1268
01:48:59,383 --> 01:49:00,551
Are you okay?

1269
01:49:00,631 --> 01:49:01,622
Yes sir.

1270
01:49:01,747 --> 01:49:03,622
Simmba, were you at Galle Port?

1271
01:49:03,705 --> 01:49:06,160
No, I was where the boats
and all are parked.

1272
01:49:06,240 --> 01:49:07,457
That is what you call a port.

1273
01:49:07,537 --> 01:49:09,283
Then that's where sister-in-law is.

1274
01:49:10,085 --> 01:49:11,321
Sir, police.

1275
01:49:11,401 --> 01:49:12,497
You two should go.

1276
01:49:12,580 --> 01:49:13,955
We will handle them.

1277
01:49:14,035 --> 01:49:15,228
Get the team ready

1278
01:49:15,361 --> 01:49:17,029
and send them the coordinates
for Galle Port.

1279
01:49:17,109 --> 01:49:18,205
Yes, sir.

1280
01:49:23,253 --> 01:49:24,330
Turn left.

1281
01:49:30,228 --> 01:49:32,538
Sir, um... turn right.

1282
01:49:32,618 --> 01:49:34,372
This is my first time here, you see.

1283
01:49:38,455 --> 01:49:40,684
He has a lot of men, way too many!

1284
01:49:40,764 --> 01:49:42,829
I suggest we wait outside
and have a cup of tea.

1285
01:49:42,909 --> 01:49:44,622
He's going to join us anyway, right?

1286
01:49:44,705 --> 01:49:46,663
We'll wait outside.

1287
01:49:46,747 --> 01:49:48,536
He'll arrive in a helicopter,
hanging out of it as usual.

1288
01:49:48,616 --> 01:49:50,115
Why do the two of us always have
to do everything, huh?

1289
01:49:50,195 --> 01:49:52,455
Let him come.
You've called him, right?

1290
01:49:52,997 --> 01:49:54,455
You've called him, right?

1291
01:49:55,861 --> 01:49:58,122
Damn it...

1292
01:50:03,073 --> 01:50:06,106
Sir, I really think we should wait.

1293
01:50:06,186 --> 01:50:08,225
We shouldn't go in like this.

1294
01:50:08,305 --> 01:50:09,628
Turn right.

1295
01:50:14,286 --> 01:50:15,195
Singham!

1296
01:50:21,580 --> 01:50:23,381
My door is stuck, sir.

1297
01:50:23,461 --> 01:50:24,393
You should go, sir.

1298
01:50:24,473 --> 01:50:25,830
I'll catch up with you.

1299
01:51:06,413 --> 01:51:07,622
Are you okay?

1300
01:51:09,463 --> 01:51:11,913
Welcome to Lanka, Singham.

1301
01:51:12,450 --> 01:51:15,913
Must say, what a personality!

1302
01:51:15,993 --> 01:51:18,497
Can I be honest?
Honest confession:

1303
01:51:19,066 --> 01:51:23,998
I've been wondering how I'd react
when we finally met face-to-face.

1304
01:51:24,133 --> 01:51:26,747
When people see
Bajirao Singham for the first time,

1305
01:51:26,830 --> 01:51:28,372
they either whistle,

1306
01:51:28,618 --> 01:51:30,206
applaud

1307
01:51:30,286 --> 01:51:31,935
or salute him.

1308
01:51:32,015 --> 01:51:34,038
But I've got a different plan in mind.

1309
01:51:35,694 --> 01:51:37,122
I'm going to take you out.

1310
01:51:38,284 --> 01:51:40,372
Now all I need to decide

1311
01:51:40,847 --> 01:51:42,497
whether I'm going to do it now,

1312
01:51:43,761 --> 01:51:45,913
or wait until Oman Hafiz gets back.

1313
01:51:45,997 --> 01:51:48,913
If you wait, you will get
a few more hours to live.

1314
01:51:51,159 --> 01:51:54,492
What has got you feeling
so proud of yourself, huh, Singham?

1315
01:51:54,622 --> 01:51:57,038
Your government's plan has failed.

1316
01:51:57,390 --> 01:52:00,497
Simmba lies down there.

1317
01:52:01,245 --> 01:52:03,288
You are standing here staring death
in the face.

1318
01:52:04,046 --> 01:52:06,522
I kidnapped your wife just like that,

1319
01:52:06,602 --> 01:52:09,128
and you couldn't do a thing about it.

1320
01:52:09,208 --> 01:52:12,327
So Avni, what exactly is he
so proud of, huh?

1321
01:52:13,258 --> 01:52:14,986
You made a very big mistake.

1322
01:52:15,066 --> 01:52:16,413
I made a mistake?

1323
01:52:16,941 --> 01:52:18,913
You think you can teach me right
from wrong?

1324
01:52:20,629 --> 01:52:23,170
Your Indian Army killed my father,

1325
01:52:23,250 --> 01:52:27,635
you and your friends
shot down my family,

1326
01:52:27,715 --> 01:52:29,346
and you have the nerve
to lecture me on morality?

1327
01:52:29,426 --> 01:52:33,122
There's no such thing as right
or wrong when it comes to family.

1328
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:36,038
You came here for your family,
didn't you?

1329
01:52:36,122 --> 01:52:37,876
You came for your wife, didn't you?

1330
01:52:38,016 --> 01:52:40,553
The ones we killed were terrorists,

1331
01:52:40,633 --> 01:52:42,711
and we'll do the same thing
in the future as well.

1332
01:52:42,791 --> 01:52:45,163
If you so much as look at our country,

1333
01:52:45,247 --> 01:52:46,916
we will kill you!

1334
01:52:46,996 --> 01:52:48,069
If you so much as set foot
in our country,

1335
01:52:48,149 --> 01:52:49,426
we will kill you!

1336
01:52:49,506 --> 01:52:51,482
And if you try to flee and hide
in another country,

1337
01:52:51,613 --> 01:52:53,514
we'll track you down there
and kill you!

1338
01:52:53,594 --> 01:52:55,825
I told your grandfather the same thing,

1339
01:52:55,905 --> 01:52:58,122
but the old man just wouldn't understand!

1340
01:52:58,205 --> 01:53:00,720
- Hey!
- Today, I am letting you know as well.

1341
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:02,830
The one standing

1342
01:53:02,910 --> 01:53:05,699
in front of you respects
Mahatma Gandhi,

1343
01:53:05,779 --> 01:53:08,942
but the one he worships
is Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj!

1344
01:53:09,022 --> 01:53:12,538
I told you, I'm a Maratha!

1345
01:53:13,249 --> 01:53:16,618
I promised I'd come for Avni.

1346
01:53:16,698 --> 01:53:18,632
Today, I'm making you another promise -

1347
01:53:18,712 --> 01:53:20,257
I swear on my mother,

1348
01:53:20,337 --> 01:53:22,497
I'll tear you apart before I leave.

1349
01:53:23,058 --> 01:53:24,738
Come on, Danger Baba!

1350
01:53:24,818 --> 01:53:27,654
How are you going to see your grandfather
if you go and kill them?

1351
01:53:27,734 --> 01:53:28,687
Cool down. Let me talk to him.

1352
01:53:28,767 --> 01:53:29,872
I'll talk to him, alright?

1353
01:53:29,952 --> 01:53:32,122
Are you out of your mind
or something?

1354
01:53:32,205 --> 01:53:33,345
Sister-in-law,
talk some sense into him, will you?

1355
01:53:33,425 --> 01:53:35,451
Cool down, man.
Cool down.

1356
01:53:35,531 --> 01:53:37,540
Look, tomorrow Sooryavanshi Sir
is going come here with your grandfather.

1357
01:53:37,620 --> 01:53:38,795
The three of us can sit down
and figure this out together.

1358
01:53:38,875 --> 01:53:39,781
Forget about them, okay?

1359
01:53:39,861 --> 01:53:40,667
You... cool down.

1360
01:53:40,747 --> 01:53:41,997
Hey, you want a cold drink

1361
01:53:42,077 --> 01:53:42,975
or an ice cream?

1362
01:53:43,055 --> 01:53:44,355
Hey Builder,
go get him an ice cream.

1363
01:53:44,435 --> 01:53:45,471
Fine, don't have the ice cream.
Don't have it.

1364
01:53:45,551 --> 01:53:46,501
I said don't have it.

1365
01:53:46,581 --> 01:53:48,090
It's got too many calories anyway,
so don't have it.

1366
01:53:48,170 --> 01:53:48,968
I told you I'll go check on things,

1367
01:53:49,048 --> 01:53:50,591
so why did you come out here?

1368
01:53:50,671 --> 01:53:51,800
Yes, grab me and take me
back inside.

1369
01:53:51,880 --> 01:53:52,712
Take us with you.

1370
01:53:52,792 --> 01:53:54,494
Oh no, we got caught!
We got caught!

1371
01:53:54,574 --> 01:53:55,705
Come on, let's go.

1372
01:54:07,912 --> 01:54:08,704
Sorry...

1373
01:54:10,120 --> 01:54:12,245
that you had to endure all
this because of me.

1374
01:54:14,597 --> 01:54:16,912
I am Bajirao Singham's wife.

1375
01:54:16,995 --> 01:54:19,245
These minor wounds mean nothing.

1376
01:54:22,870 --> 01:54:24,287
You are my strength.

1377
01:54:25,162 --> 01:54:26,120
And you are mine.

1378
01:54:27,037 --> 01:54:30,263
Looking at Sister-in-law,
it's clear why you act like a lion.

1379
01:54:30,343 --> 01:54:32,620
Yes, if you're the power,
then she's your superpower.

1380
01:54:32,704 --> 01:54:34,740
If you're the bun, she's the patty.

1381
01:54:34,820 --> 01:54:37,204
If you're the iPhone,
she's your charger.

1382
01:54:37,287 --> 01:54:38,579
Sorry, continue.

1383
01:54:39,287 --> 01:54:40,579
How is Shaurya?

1384
01:54:42,870 --> 01:54:43,787
He's fine.

1385
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:46,162
Honestly,

1386
01:54:47,270 --> 01:54:49,662
I was worried about how to explain

1387
01:54:50,382 --> 01:54:52,079
what happened to his mother,

1388
01:54:53,662 --> 01:54:54,995
but he handled it bravely.

1389
01:54:57,204 --> 01:54:58,745
He's really grown up,

1390
01:54:58,829 --> 01:54:59,745
and we've aged.

1391
01:54:59,829 --> 01:55:01,704
Oh, don't say that, sir.

1392
01:55:01,787 --> 01:55:03,537
These days, it's the older
generation that's in form

1393
01:55:03,620 --> 01:55:05,245
and causing a ruckus.

1394
01:55:05,329 --> 01:55:06,537
Shut up, Simmba.

1395
01:55:07,620 --> 01:55:09,287
Hello, Mr. Bajirao Singham,

1396
01:55:10,035 --> 01:55:11,787
we're not that old.

1397
01:55:12,995 --> 01:55:16,912
Actually, you've shown so much
courage during these hard times.

1398
01:55:17,995 --> 01:55:22,412
"We need to gradually increase
the love!"

1399
01:55:22,537 --> 01:55:26,120
"We have to go above and beyond."

1400
01:55:26,204 --> 01:55:27,704
You're so dramatic!

1401
01:55:27,787 --> 01:55:29,287
You should've been in the movies.

1402
01:55:29,370 --> 01:55:30,454
How did you end up becoming
a policeman?

1403
01:55:30,579 --> 01:55:32,620
Sister-in-law,
I've been dramatic since childhood.

1404
01:55:32,704 --> 01:55:34,454
I used to sell tickets
for inflated prices outside the theater.

1405
01:55:34,579 --> 01:55:37,287
Once, I went to watch a movie,

1406
01:55:37,367 --> 01:55:40,579
but the real action unfolded
outside the theater.

1407
01:55:45,829 --> 01:55:47,912
And guess who's the hero creating chaos?

1408
01:55:47,995 --> 01:55:49,912
One and only Singham!

1409
01:56:00,079 --> 01:56:01,967
But, Sister-in-law,
I have a sincere request.

1410
01:56:02,047 --> 01:56:03,964
I'll inform Mrs. Sooryavanshi as well.

1411
01:56:04,044 --> 01:56:06,129
You all need to stay cautious.

1412
01:56:06,209 --> 01:56:07,829
Otherwise, then you might get kidnapped,

1413
01:56:07,912 --> 01:56:08,954
and then everyone has to come together.

1414
01:56:09,037 --> 01:56:11,707
Coordinating everyone's dates
becomes a challenge.

1415
01:56:11,787 --> 01:56:14,829
Yes, ordinary people reunite
at weddings and birthdays.

1416
01:56:14,912 --> 01:56:18,204
Our reunions happen
when someone has a crisis.

1417
01:56:36,954 --> 01:56:40,043
Eh, eh, what you doing, eh?

1418
01:56:40,537 --> 01:56:41,412
Oh!

1419
01:56:41,579 --> 01:56:44,183
- Singham, we're releasing Omar.
- But, sir...

1420
01:56:44,300 --> 01:56:45,686
It's an order, Singham.

1421
01:56:45,807 --> 01:56:47,829
However, you must promise us that:

1422
01:56:48,548 --> 01:56:53,204
You'll return Omar
to India along with Avni.

1423
01:56:56,408 --> 01:56:58,321
I admire your enthusiasm, sir.

1424
01:56:58,670 --> 01:57:00,299
But I also want Sooryavanshi.

1425
01:57:00,379 --> 01:57:02,844
Yes, yes, I'll send him too.

1426
01:57:02,924 --> 01:57:06,394
- Avni, are you okay?
- Yes, sir.

1427
01:57:06,474 --> 01:57:08,412
- I'm here as well!
- Yes, Simmba.

1428
01:57:08,550 --> 01:57:10,537
I've seen your picture.

1429
01:57:10,620 --> 01:57:12,287
You look like you're in a mood to party.

1430
01:57:12,418 --> 01:57:14,537
And Avni, just so you know,

1431
01:57:14,620 --> 01:57:18,037
your Ramleela is going wonderfully.

1432
01:57:19,329 --> 01:57:23,079
Singham, the war begins tomorrow.

1433
01:57:23,787 --> 01:57:25,870
Great warriors will be there,

1434
01:57:26,477 --> 01:57:28,829
not just Lord Ram and Lord Hanuman,

1435
01:57:29,472 --> 01:57:32,037
but Lakshman will also come,

1436
01:57:32,120 --> 01:57:34,662
Sugreev will be there too,

1437
01:57:35,081 --> 01:57:38,370
and Garuda will join as well.

1438
01:57:41,796 --> 01:57:43,704
Poor Ravan!

1439
01:57:48,245 --> 01:57:52,954
On one hand there is sin,
evil and demons to defeat,

1440
01:57:54,162 --> 01:57:58,454
On the other,
there is a man with a promise to keep.

1441
01:58:01,079 --> 01:58:03,745
Yet the brave don't walk this path alone,

1442
01:58:04,905 --> 01:58:06,806
They find their warriors at every turn.

1443
01:58:06,886 --> 01:58:08,239
The army is ready,

1444
01:58:08,319 --> 01:58:10,037
everything is about to be set ablaze,

1445
01:58:10,117 --> 01:58:12,143
Virtue and vice are face-to-face,

1446
01:58:12,223 --> 01:58:14,787
Once again, an epic battle
is going to take place.

1447
01:58:15,023 --> 01:58:17,356
Omar Hafiz's plane has already departed
from India.

1448
01:58:17,436 --> 01:58:20,025
I thought India does not negotiate
with terrorists.

1449
01:58:20,182 --> 01:58:21,447
So what happened?

1450
01:58:21,930 --> 01:58:23,537
Did India finally yield?

1451
01:58:23,820 --> 01:58:25,912
Over the last 9,000 years,

1452
01:58:26,362 --> 01:58:28,329
many have tried to alter
our country's history.

1453
01:58:29,431 --> 01:58:31,998
Today, no one even remembers
their names.

1454
01:58:34,029 --> 01:58:37,001
Those who aspired
to shape India's future ended

1455
01:58:38,036 --> 01:58:40,036
up becoming history.

1456
01:58:40,119 --> 01:58:41,786
I must say, Singham,

1457
01:58:41,869 --> 01:58:43,286
even though your life is at risk,

1458
01:58:43,369 --> 01:58:45,828
your spirit of patriotism
remains unwavering.

1459
01:58:45,911 --> 01:58:47,786
Look at these two one last time,

1460
01:58:49,453 --> 01:58:52,119
because you will return
only with their remains.

1461
01:58:57,411 --> 01:59:00,203
Do you know why Lord Ram refused
to forgive Ravan?

1462
01:59:00,994 --> 01:59:02,911
Because he wasn't worthy of a lesson;

1463
01:59:02,994 --> 01:59:04,786
he was deserving of punishment.

1464
01:59:07,369 --> 01:59:08,494
Singham...

1465
01:59:09,661 --> 01:59:12,286
please give him one chance
before taking his life.

1466
01:59:14,119 --> 01:59:15,369
He's just a child.

1467
01:59:15,449 --> 01:59:17,994
- Oh my God, insult!
- Let's go.

1468
01:59:18,869 --> 01:59:20,331
In the silver age (Treta)
or the dark age (Kalyug),

1469
01:59:20,411 --> 01:59:21,610
the warriors of our land,

1470
01:59:21,690 --> 01:59:23,786
Chant the same mantra,
and take a stand.

1471
01:59:28,852 --> 01:59:31,967
They bow to women,
showing respect so true,

1472
01:59:38,037 --> 01:59:41,186
But when a woman's insulted,
they'll sever a head for her too.

1473
01:59:45,692 --> 01:59:48,578
Everyone knows who all are coming.

1474
01:59:48,661 --> 01:59:49,994
Don't you know?

1475
02:03:13,138 --> 02:03:15,341
When the Naagpaash unleashed
its fierce wrath,

1476
02:03:15,421 --> 02:03:17,499
Despair resounded on every path!

1477
02:03:17,579 --> 02:03:19,895
Lord Hanuman, in plight,

1478
02:03:19,975 --> 02:03:22,098
Called out to Lord Vishnu to guide.

1479
02:03:22,178 --> 02:03:25,554
Whenever victory makes
the unrighteous swell with pride,

1480
02:03:25,634 --> 02:03:29,102
A mighty,
fierce warrior arrives.

1481
02:03:29,182 --> 02:03:32,623
All things will perish,
nothing will stay,

1482
02:03:32,703 --> 02:03:37,494
When Garuda Dev parts the clouds
on and makes his way!

1483
02:03:56,176 --> 02:03:57,744
Show off.

1484
02:05:07,994 --> 02:05:09,684
Good morning, Sister-in-law.

1485
02:07:29,869 --> 02:07:33,036
Control to Oscar one
Rescue mission successful,

1486
02:07:33,274 --> 02:07:34,906
return to base.

1487
02:07:38,356 --> 02:07:40,203
Sir we can't find him here.

1488
02:07:40,283 --> 02:07:41,661
- Go check the other side.
- Ok sir.

1489
02:07:46,088 --> 02:07:47,411
I'm out of ammo.

1490
02:07:47,574 --> 02:07:48,953
So am I.

1491
02:07:49,713 --> 02:07:51,016
He's got to be around
here somewhere.

1492
02:07:51,215 --> 02:07:52,203
Found him?

1493
02:07:52,369 --> 02:07:53,078
No.

1494
02:07:53,234 --> 02:07:54,768
- Go check over there.
- Okay.

1495
02:07:58,628 --> 02:08:00,203
- Hand me the gun.
- Give me the gun.

1496
02:08:07,533 --> 02:08:09,036
Katappa!

1497
02:08:11,152 --> 02:08:12,953
It's not Katappa, sir. It's Simmba!

1498
02:08:13,678 --> 02:08:15,119
I know.

1499
02:08:16,453 --> 02:08:18,244
I said that because you betrayed me.

1500
02:08:18,324 --> 02:08:19,203
No, that's not it.

1501
02:08:19,286 --> 02:08:21,994
I'm a lefty, so my arm just extended
when he asked...

1502
02:08:22,078 --> 02:08:23,161
Yes, I'm coming!

1503
02:08:23,244 --> 02:08:25,536
No one called him,
yet he's saying he's coming!

1504
02:08:31,378 --> 02:08:32,369
Sir!

1505
02:08:33,203 --> 02:08:34,453
Can I say something, sir?

1506
02:08:34,578 --> 02:08:37,828
Sooryavanshi Sir is very
"manicure" about you.

1507
02:08:37,911 --> 02:08:38,703
Insecure.

1508
02:08:38,786 --> 02:08:40,229
Yes, right, he is very "pedicure".

1509
02:08:40,345 --> 02:08:41,751
You should have seen
the look on his face

1510
02:08:41,831 --> 02:08:43,203
when I handed you my gun.

1511
02:08:43,994 --> 02:08:45,766
He was giving me a death stare.

1512
02:08:45,846 --> 02:08:47,369
He was jealous, plain and simple.

1513
02:08:47,494 --> 02:08:49,286
I told him, "Alright,
you must be the great Sooryavanshi Sir,"

1514
02:08:49,369 --> 02:08:52,161
"but Singham is like my big brother,
damn it."

1515
02:08:52,244 --> 02:08:53,078
Don't be scared, keep going.

1516
02:08:53,161 --> 02:08:54,661
Who's scared? Not me, sir.
I'm not scared at all.

1517
02:08:54,744 --> 02:08:56,744
I might act scared,
but I'm not afraid of him.

1518
02:08:56,828 --> 02:08:58,536
He could never get my name right.

1519
02:08:58,619 --> 02:08:59,703
He'd call me everything
from Samba, Bamba,

1520
02:08:59,786 --> 02:09:02,703
Lamba to Ramba, except for Simmba.

1521
02:09:02,786 --> 02:09:06,411
When he goes to a restaurant and wants
'Badam ka Halwa' (Almond Pudding)

1522
02:09:06,494 --> 02:09:08,869
he'll end up ordering 'Sadam ka Jalwa'
(Sadam's grandeur) instead!

1523
02:09:08,953 --> 02:09:10,536
What he did the other day
was just too much.

1524
02:09:10,619 --> 02:09:13,203
I heard he dropped his kid
at the headquarters

1525
02:09:13,286 --> 02:09:14,619
and went to school instead.

1526
02:09:15,578 --> 02:09:17,911
The other day,
he tried to quote a movie line to me.

1527
02:09:17,994 --> 02:09:19,161
And he messed that up too!

1528
02:09:19,244 --> 02:09:21,953
"He who gets defeated
and then thrashed is called a sorcerer."

1529
02:09:22,578 --> 02:09:23,703
What else did he say?

1530
02:09:23,786 --> 02:09:25,536
There's nothing more to add.

1531
02:09:25,744 --> 02:09:27,494
He's always hanging out
of a helicopter.

1532
02:09:27,578 --> 02:09:29,411
I say, why not just buy a ticket,

1533
02:09:29,491 --> 02:09:30,994
sit back, and enjoy
the ride respectfully?

1534
02:09:31,078 --> 02:09:34,119
But no, he insists on hanging!

1535
02:09:34,199 --> 02:09:37,369
I feel like putting a bullet
in your head,

1536
02:09:37,453 --> 02:09:38,744
and hang you, right here, right now!

1537
02:09:39,494 --> 02:09:41,286
No, I have something important
to take care of.

1538
02:09:41,369 --> 02:09:42,661
I'll go deal with it.

1539
02:09:42,786 --> 02:09:44,536
- I'm coming!
- Who's there?

1540
02:09:44,828 --> 02:09:45,786
Sir.

1541
02:09:46,328 --> 02:09:47,286
What is it?

1542
02:09:47,369 --> 02:09:49,453
What happened
to you was really wrong, sir.

1543
02:09:49,619 --> 02:09:51,453
It's making me tear up, sir.
Sorry sir

1544
02:09:52,610 --> 02:09:55,703
You rascal,
you haven't shed a single tear

1545
02:09:55,786 --> 02:09:56,994
and you say you're crying.

1546
02:09:57,078 --> 02:09:57,994
You're enjoying my misery.

1547
02:09:58,078 --> 02:10:00,494
No, sir, not me,
they enjoy your misery.

1548
02:10:01,743 --> 02:10:03,703
You keep forgetting names,
don't you, sir?

1549
02:10:03,786 --> 02:10:04,828
It's not so, Tatya.

1550
02:10:04,953 --> 02:10:06,911
It's not Tatya, it's Satya, sir!

1551
02:11:00,344 --> 02:11:01,512
What just happened?

1552
02:11:03,058 --> 02:11:06,989
Or a place like this where
because of low gravitational force

1553
02:11:07,069 --> 02:11:10,335
for some time satellites loose their signal.

1554
02:11:10,471 --> 02:11:13,102
I'm talking about the Unawatuna region
of Sri Lanka.

1555
02:11:13,182 --> 02:11:16,012
Legend has it that when Lord Hanuman
was carrying the Dronagiri Mountain,

1556
02:11:16,092 --> 02:11:19,221
a portion of the mountain fell here,
in Unawatuna.

1557
02:11:19,301 --> 02:11:23,627
It's rumored that because of this,
the area has a lower gravitational force.

1558
02:11:23,707 --> 02:11:26,609
As a result, satellites passing
through here may encounter

1559
02:11:26,689 --> 02:11:29,923
glitches during tracking.

1560
02:13:40,443 --> 02:13:41,922
Where's your attitude now, huh?

1561
02:13:42,810 --> 02:13:44,879
This is what you are worth, you scoundrel.

1562
02:13:44,959 --> 02:13:47,863
How dare you lay your hand on my wife!

1563
02:13:48,404 --> 02:13:50,420
I feel like burying you right here,

1564
02:13:51,023 --> 02:13:52,057
but I won't.

1565
02:13:52,887 --> 02:13:56,767
I'll take you back to India
and keep you alive

1566
02:13:57,081 --> 02:13:59,570
so the whole world can see
the state you are in,

1567
02:14:00,042 --> 02:14:02,981
and no one else dares to be like you.

1568
02:14:03,391 --> 02:14:08,045
I'd rather die than live the life
you're offering me, Singham.

1569
02:14:09,642 --> 02:14:11,919
Don't confuse your mistake with pride.

1570
02:14:11,999 --> 02:14:14,048
You won't achieve from it.

1571
02:14:14,128 --> 02:14:17,575
This war was never
about achieving something.

1572
02:14:18,370 --> 02:14:21,110
My goal was to avenge my people.

1573
02:14:23,683 --> 02:14:26,795
You've never lost a dear one, Singham.

1574
02:14:27,351 --> 02:14:28,294
That's why...

1575
02:14:28,374 --> 02:14:31,670
The innocent Indians your family killed

1576
02:14:31,843 --> 02:14:33,395
were all dear to me.

1577
02:14:34,346 --> 02:14:36,336
The whole of India is my family,

1578
02:14:36,420 --> 02:14:39,136
and I am the Zubair Hafiz of India.

1579
02:14:39,216 --> 02:14:40,994
If my patience runs out,

1580
02:14:41,115 --> 02:14:44,364
I'll cut your head off
and take it back to my country with me.

1581
02:14:45,250 --> 02:14:46,424
Take him away!

1582
02:15:13,972 --> 02:15:21,110
Bajirao!

1583
02:15:36,447 --> 02:15:38,627
Arrogance.

1584
02:15:40,202 --> 02:15:42,221
Arrogance.

1585
02:16:13,329 --> 02:16:14,540
Thank you.

1586
02:16:16,822 --> 02:16:17,985
Thank you.

1587
02:16:19,992 --> 02:16:21,298
I can't hear you.

1588
02:16:21,378 --> 02:16:23,034
Thank you for saving my life.

1589
02:16:24,870 --> 02:16:26,404
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

1590
02:16:26,484 --> 02:16:28,273
Well, he's the ones who saved me.

1591
02:16:29,179 --> 02:16:30,953
Are you deaf?
Can't you hear her?

1592
02:16:31,410 --> 02:16:33,413
Now you know what it feels like when,
after risking your life,

1593
02:16:33,493 --> 02:16:37,340
your wife thanks someone else, right?

1594
02:16:39,012 --> 02:16:41,570
By the way, what's her name?

1595
02:16:44,732 --> 02:16:45,788
Avni!

1596
02:16:47,907 --> 02:16:49,208
My sister-in-law, Avni!

1597
02:16:49,288 --> 02:16:52,474
You know, you and I are exactly the same.

1598
02:16:52,554 --> 02:16:54,598
- Really?
- Both are orphans.

1599
02:16:55,723 --> 02:16:57,541
A person isn't an orphan
because of a lack of relations,

1600
02:16:57,621 --> 02:16:59,376
but because of a lack of loved ones.

1601
02:16:59,889 --> 02:17:01,086
You have a big brother,

1602
02:17:01,236 --> 02:17:04,988
a sister-in-law,
and friends around you.

1603
02:17:05,333 --> 02:17:07,415
Tell me, why did you come to save me?

1604
02:17:08,212 --> 02:17:10,167
Because we're family, okay?

1605
02:17:10,247 --> 02:17:11,653
And a crazy one.

1606
02:17:12,023 --> 02:17:12,911
Got it?

1607
02:17:12,991 --> 02:17:14,504
Yes.
And look...

1608
02:17:15,090 --> 02:17:16,796
our family is growing.

1609
02:17:18,471 --> 02:17:20,213
- May I take her, sir?
- Yes.

1610
02:17:31,620 --> 02:17:34,504
It's not that all the evil
in the world will be vanquished.

1611
02:17:35,617 --> 02:17:38,387
The enemies of our country
will rise time and again.

1612
02:17:38,503 --> 02:17:39,774
There will be moments
when it seems like evil is

1613
02:17:39,854 --> 02:17:42,031
on the verge of victory,

1614
02:17:42,111 --> 02:17:44,625
but whenever the night of evil descends,

1615
02:17:44,705 --> 02:17:47,920
the morning sun will reveal
those rebels willing

1616
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:49,906
to risk their lives

1617
02:17:50,022 --> 02:17:51,944
to ensure that good triumphs.

1618
02:17:52,081 --> 02:17:53,822
This victory of good over evil

1619
02:17:53,902 --> 02:17:57,823
is a part of India's history
and its future.

1620
02:19:54,539 --> 02:19:55,837
Singham!

1621
02:19:58,386 --> 02:20:00,551
Aren't you going to welcome me?

1622
02:20:02,344 --> 02:20:04,228
The fun is about to begin!

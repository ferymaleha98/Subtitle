00:15:48,121 --> 00:15:49,426
Well, the whole city's
underwater.

181
00:15:49,557 --> 00:15:50,688
They know that.

182
00:15:51,472 --> 00:15:53,822
You must have had an awful time.
We've been ever so worried.

183
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,304
Sweetheart, sit down.
Have something to eat.

184
00:15:57,434 --> 00:15:59,045
Oh, thank you.

185
00:15:59,132 --> 00:16:01,438
He's beautiful.
I think so.

186
00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:03,005
Go and help your son
unpack the car.

187
00:16:03,092 --> 00:16:04,659
No, it's fine, Mom. All done.

188
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,053
Should have got out ages ago.

189
00:16:07,357 --> 00:16:09,359
Yeah, but we didn't know
this was gonna happen, did we?

190
00:16:10,447 --> 00:16:11,318
I did warn you.

191
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:12,667
We were a bit
preoccupied, Dad.

192
00:16:12,754 --> 00:16:14,451
Too preoccupied
for the birth of your own son?

193
00:16:14,538 --> 00:16:16,236
Oh, right, 'cause you were
there as the bloody midwife

194
00:16:16,323 --> 00:16:17,585
while I was having that one,
were you?

195
00:16:17,672 --> 00:16:19,456
- I was involved.
- Oh, sorry.

196
00:16:19,587 --> 00:16:21,197
Sweetheart,
he was very involved, yeah.

197
00:16:21,328 --> 00:16:23,286
- Oh, this looks delicious.
Well, you must be starving.

198
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:24,679
Eating for two.
I used to be famished.

199
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:27,290
And meat. I used to just
want to eat entire cows.

200
00:16:27,377 --> 00:16:28,770
- Do you remember?
I do.

201
00:16:29,597 --> 00:16:31,729
We've been keeping supplies
for years now.

202
00:16:31,816 --> 00:16:33,470
You lot kept calling me
a hoarder.

203
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:35,429
Who's laughing now, eh?

204
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:37,474
Don't know how you townies
managed to cope.

205
00:16:37,561 --> 00:16:38,519
Can you give us a hand?

206
00:16:38,823 --> 00:16:40,608
What did you just call us?

207
00:16:40,695 --> 00:16:42,914
Well, stuck that long in London,
what do you expect?

208
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:44,742
We can't do our jobs
out of London, Dad.

209
00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:46,614
What, engineer? Cutting hair?

210
00:16:47,136 --> 00:16:48,964
Your mom's feeding the village, obviously.

211
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:51,010
Well, everyone's doing
their bit. She doesn't cut hair.

212
00:16:51,097 --> 00:16:52,098
Come in!

213
00:16:52,402 --> 00:16:55,275
- Well, I mean, I do.
- Yeah, to the bloody stars.

214
00:16:55,405 --> 00:16:58,017
Breakfast TV.
Yeah, to the bloody stars.

215
00:16:58,713 --> 00:17:01,498
Erm, we just prep the boxes,
and then this one delivers
them all.

216
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:04,110
- Tea?
- Oh, no. No, thanks.

217
00:17:04,414 --> 00:17:06,155
<i>Severe flooding is expected</i>

218
00:17:06,242 --> 00:17:07,591
<i>to cause loss of life.</i>

219
00:17:07,678 --> 00:17:09,593
They just got here.
- Hey.

220
00:17:12,857 --> 00:17:17,253
I... I'll go and start this.

221
00:17:33,356 --> 00:17:34,270
It's her son.

222
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,447
He's not back yet.

223
00:17:48,328 --> 00:17:51,200
How's the ark?
Er, pretty moldy.

224
00:17:51,461 --> 00:17:53,550
But Dad says
it has good bones, so...

225
00:17:54,464 --> 00:17:55,857
What happened
to our home?

226
00:17:56,684 --> 00:18:01,297
The street was gone.
But, but... we build a new home.

227
00:18:02,646 --> 00:18:03,647
Yeah?

228
00:18:03,952 --> 00:18:06,085
Yeah.

229
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:14,615
Here we go.

230
00:18:17,008 --> 00:18:19,881
What do you think?
What do you think?

231
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,631
Okay, okay, okay.

232
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,025
I know, I know, I know.

233
00:18:43,774 --> 00:18:45,124
Ow, Zeb, ow.

234
00:19:07,624 --> 00:19:11,019
Baby. Baby. Mom.

235
00:19:13,804 --> 00:19:16,720
Mom, mom, mom, mom, mom.

236
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:19,070
I'm sorry yours isn't here.

237
00:19:23,814 --> 00:19:25,207
Has the cork always been here?

238
00:19:28,471 --> 00:19:32,475
Where are your posters?

239
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,913
- Didn't have any posters.
- Of course you didn't.

240
00:19:37,698 --> 00:19:42,268
What, not even of maps?
Or fish? The periodic table?

241
00:19:42,355 --> 00:19:45,662
You're making me sound so sexy.

242
00:19:45,793 --> 00:19:47,925
I don't remember it
being like this last time.

243
00:19:49,405 --> 00:19:50,972
We just fucked last time.

244
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:55,194
With our hands
over each other's mouths.

249
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:22,498
Is it hurting?

250
00:21:22,672 --> 00:21:25,196
Go on.
No, not at all. No, no.

251
00:21:31,028 --> 00:21:33,030
<i>In an urgent appeal,

252

261
00:22:11,634 --> 00:22:13,810
I don't understand
why you all have to go.

262
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,250
- It's just safer that way.
Easier. He means easier.

263
00:22:19,555 --> 00:22:21,818
No, I mean safer.
She's not a child.

264
00:22:21,949 --> 00:22:24,168
- Yes, all right.
It'll be fine.

265
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,866
I'll stay put in the car.

266
00:22:26,432 --> 00:22:29,957
Supplies are low.
Roads are blocked.

267
00:22:30,436 --> 00:22:33,047
Ports are flooded.
Runways are flooded.

268
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:34,875
- We live on an island.
- On an island.

269
00:22:34,962 --> 00:22:37,486
Yeah, I know, but... So, people get panicky.

270
00:22:38,835 --> 00:22:41,316
I'm sorry. This...

271
00:22:42,535 --> 00:22:46,800
I know this is awful for you.

272
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,585
But I am so happy you're here.

273
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,674
I know.

274
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:57,506
Hey.

275
00:22:57,985 --> 00:22:59,378
Won't be long, okay?
- Hmm.

276
00:23:02,293 --> 00:23:03,338
Bye.

277
00:23:04,034 --> 00:23:04,948
Hmm.

278
00:23:08,996 --> 00:23:10,258
Anyone seen the shopping bag?

279
00:23:10,345 --> 00:23:11,520
No, wait, It's all right.
Found it.

280
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:12,913
We should head up
the high street.

281
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,131
No, no, no.

282
00:23:14,523 --> 00:23:15,394
Love you!

283
00:23:18,222 --> 00:23:19,267
Hey.

284
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:29,799
<i>...Ninja Filipina</i>

285
00:23:29,886 --> 00:23:31,148
<i>sister up there.</i>

286
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:33,455
<i>You're meant to be up there,
like Lou-Lou said.</i>

287
00:23:33,586 --> 00:23:35,022
<i>This is your now,
because that's your stage</i>

288
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:36,197
and you just took it...

289
00:23:50,777 --> 00:23:52,387
And they had
this summer romance

290
00:23:52,518 --> 00:23:55,564
and they, er,
really like each other, and...

291
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,959
But she's supposed
to go back to Australia,

292
00:23:59,089 --> 00:24:00,569
but she ends up staying and...

293
00:24:02,702 --> 00:24:06,401
And he's got this, like,
this gang, the T-Birds.

294
00:24:08,229 --> 00:24:12,015
And he needs to look, I guess,
like, er, I don't know,

295
00:24:12,146 --> 00:24:13,800
like really cool
in front of them.

296
00:24:13,887 --> 00:24:14,931
I mean, he's basically...

297
00:24:15,062 --> 00:24:16,716
he's just being
a dick at this point.

298
00:24:18,892 --> 00:24:21,372
Fuck.

299
00:24:37,432 --> 00:24:38,433
Hmm.

300
00:24:39,826 --> 00:24:44,439
Kick, kick, kick, kick.
Where are you running to? Hmm?

301
00:25:31,704 --> 00:25:32,966
Yeah, they will be back soon.

302
00:25:33,183 --> 00:25:36,970
I just... I...
I wasn't expecting anyone.

303
00:25:48,068 --> 00:25:49,504
Is your house...

304
00:25:51,724 --> 00:25:52,855
Er, where will you...

305
00:26:03,518 --> 00:26:06,565
Er, er, baby. I'm sorry.

306
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,571
I just, erm...
We don't have any food.

307
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:26,541
Thank you.

308
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,554
I know, I know, I know.

309
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:41,817
I know, I know.
It's fucking awful. I know.

310
00:26:42,818 --> 00:26:46,256
I know, I know. Where are they?

311
00:27:36,002 --> 00:27:36,959
I'm sorry.

312
00:27:41,355 --> 00:27:42,399
We'll fix this.

313
00:27:44,445 --> 00:27:49,145
We'll go home and you'll
grow tall and strong and kind,

314
00:27:49,276 --> 00:27:50,886
and you won't remember
any of this.

315
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:57,763
This isn't how
it's supposed to be.

316
00:27:58,415 --> 00:28:02,158
I'm sorry.

317
00:28:04,465 --> 00:28:08,034
Sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry.

318
00:29:47,568 --> 00:29:48,699
I'm so sorry.

319
00:29:53,356 --> 00:29:55,881
I will look after you
like you looked after me.

320
00:29:57,404 --> 00:30:00,189
I love you.

321
00:30:03,758 --> 00:30:05,194
Do you wanna talk about it?

322
00:30:09,155 --> 00:30:10,112
I can't.

323
00:30:21,384 --> 00:30:22,472
It wasn't quick.

324
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:32,961
I'm so sorry.

325
00:30:37,052 --> 00:30:38,488
I'm so sorry.

326
00:32:42,873 --> 00:32:44,092
You're up. Are you...

327
00:32:46,529 --> 00:32:48,705
Sorry. I was just...

328
00:32:49,837 --> 00:32:53,232
Why don't you come in,
let me make you a cup of tea?

329
00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:57,105
- And you must be hungry.
I'm going for a walk.

330
00:32:57,192 --> 00:32:58,541
Well, I don't think
that's a good idea.

331
00:32:58,628 --> 00:32:59,890
I'm going for a walk.

332
00:33:00,369 --> 00:33:02,893
Okay.
Grandad's going for a walk.

333
00:33:06,245 --> 00:33:07,159
Babe?

334
00:33:07,681 --> 00:33:11,250
Your dad, he's, er, he's...
Look, something's not right.

335
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,686
I don't know where he's going.

336
00:33:12,773 --> 00:33:14,427
Huh?
- Look, can you take the baby?

337
00:33:27,527 --> 00:33:30,051
No!

338
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,396
<i>We can't stay here.</i>

339
00:34:12,354 --> 00:34:13,834
<i>There's no food anyway.</i>

340
00:34:17,272 --> 00:34:18,404
<i>We need to leave.</i>

341
00:34:20,275 --> 00:34:21,972
They want people
to join shelters.

342
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,539
No, I'm not joining a shelter.

343
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:27,804
I'm sorry.

344
00:34:29,197 --> 00:34:30,285
I just... I...

345
00:34:31,286 --> 00:34:34,768
I... I just can't.
Too many people.

346
00:34:35,377 --> 00:34:36,335
I just...

347
00:34:39,468 --> 00:34:40,469
I just can't do it.

348
00:34:42,819 --> 00:34:44,473
I don't know
what else there is.

349
00:34:56,616 --> 00:34:57,660
I love you.

350
00:35:00,446 --> 00:35:01,403
I love you.

351
00:35:14,808 --> 00:35:16,810
Stop pushing!

352
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,161
Get back!

353
00:35:20,727 --> 00:35:22,163
People will be, er...

354
00:35:22,381 --> 00:35:24,557
I don't know, calmer around us
with having a baby.

355
00:35:24,687 --> 00:35:26,472
They trampled on my mom's neck.

356
00:35:26,602 --> 00:35:28,778
People are starving to death.
They don't give a fuck.

357
00:35:28,909 --> 00:35:30,171
- People give a fuck.
- No.

358
00:35:30,302 --> 00:35:32,130
- No, no, they don't.
- I don't believe that.

359
00:35:32,217 --> 00:35:34,480
Look, I'm not having
an existential argument with you

360
00:35:34,567 --> 00:35:36,134
about the inherent
shittiness of people.

361
00:35:36,264 --> 00:35:38,310
I'm telling you,
they trampled on my mom's neck.

362
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,920
That's why I'm saying I'll go.

363
00:35:42,009 --> 00:35:43,924
You stay in the car. I'll go.

364
00:35:44,054 --> 00:35:47,797
No. You're his food.
You're his whole ecosystem.

365
00:35:49,712 --> 00:35:54,282
Just wait. I can do it.
Just give me a minute.

366
00:36:44,463 --> 00:36:46,813
This is your last load!

367
00:36:49,555 --> 00:36:50,773
Stop pushing!

368
00:36:51,557 --> 00:36:53,080
Everyone just stay
where you are.

369
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,300
Move back. Move back.
Stay where you are.

370
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:58,346
Don'â€™t make me pull it. I will.
It's a final warning.

371
00:38:10,113 --> 00:38:11,376
We can't raise him
in a fucking car.

372
00:38:11,637 --> 00:38:13,639
We're not raising him in a car.
We're trying to get through.

373
00:38:13,769 --> 00:38:15,249
We're not in a shelter
because of me,

374
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,817
and we need to do what's right
for him and for you.

375
00:38:17,904 --> 00:38:21,429
We have to do what is right
for all of us.

376
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:25,390
Hmm?

377
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:33,441
We need to go to a shelter.

378
00:38:34,747 --> 00:38:35,748
Okay.

379
00:39:11,827 --> 00:39:13,699
Ladies and gents,
I can understand...

380
00:39:13,829 --> 00:39:15,570
...you've been waiting
many hours outside,

381
00:39:15,701 --> 00:39:18,399
but unfortunately, there are
no more places at this time.

382
00:39:18,486 --> 00:39:21,837
We can only accept children
and one primary carer.

383
00:39:28,104 --> 00:39:30,803
<i>We're taking children
and one parent only.</i>

384
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,459
Look, it's okay.

385
00:39:34,589 --> 00:39:38,114
I'll come back for you,
er, when things are calmer.

386
00:39:39,202 --> 00:39:40,290
There'll be food here.

387
00:39:41,553 --> 00:39:43,859
It'll be good
for you both, okay?

388
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:46,340
Okay, well, no, no, no,
none of us'll go.

389
00:39:46,775 --> 00:39:47,994
No, you have to.

390
00:39:48,211 --> 00:39:49,865
No, we'll just...
we'll just keep driving.

391
00:39:49,952 --> 00:39:51,345
If you're here, you're safe.

392
00:39:51,998 --> 00:39:53,521
'Cause...

393
00:39:56,306 --> 00:39:57,395
...I can't protect you.

394
00:39:59,179 --> 00:40:00,789
I can't protect you or Zeb,

395
00:40:01,311 --> 00:40:06,273
and... and it will feel good
to just know that you're safe.

396
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,232
I don't give a fuck
what will feel good.

397
00:40:09,363 --> 00:40:11,539
- We have a baby.
- I know.

398
00:40:11,757 --> 00:40:15,108
No, you have a baby.
We're a family.

399
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,720
I feel like I'm dying.

400
00:40:23,203 --> 00:40:24,552
I will let you down.

401
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:31,385
We stay together.

402
00:40:36,825 --> 00:40:38,958
We stay together.

403
00:41:02,416 --> 00:41:04,810
<i>Unknown vehicle
arriving at the gate. Over.</i>

404
00:41:04,897 --> 00:41:07,377
<i>So, it's shelter 26.
It's breakfast at 7:00.</i>

405
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:10,076
<i>Er, we have a strict
lights-out policy at 9:00.</i>

406
00:41:10,816 --> 00:41:12,992
Now, you need to check the rota
for any laundry.

407
00:41:14,297 --> 00:41:15,821
And at the moment
we don't have any hot water,

408
00:41:15,951 --> 00:41:18,301
so it's cold showers only,
I'm afraid.

409
00:41:19,128 --> 00:41:21,479
And this is your bed. Okay?

410
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:23,524
Yeah.

411
00:41:55,121 --> 00:41:58,254
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

412
00:42:19,275 --> 00:42:21,364
There we go.

413
00:42:21,713 --> 00:42:24,542
- Come on. There we go.
Please.

414
00:42:25,586 --> 00:42:27,632
Baby, baby.
Just do it.

415
00:42:27,762 --> 00:42:29,503
I can't put...
I can't...

416
00:42:30,983 --> 00:42:33,638
Come on, baby boy.

417
00:42:40,296 --> 00:42:41,994
<i>We would remind you,</i>

418
00:42:42,081 --> 00:42:44,736
<i>that there is no smoking
inside the building.</i>

419
00:42:46,738 --> 00:42:49,610
You taking it all in? Hmm?

420
00:42:57,096 --> 00:42:58,488
What you looking at?

421
00:42:58,967 --> 00:43:02,057
<i>Shelter 27,
lunch is now postponed.</i>

422
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:24,645
Hey. Ooh!

423
00:43:28,954 --> 00:43:30,303
You think you're clever?

424
00:43:32,566 --> 00:43:33,828
Have you taken my pillow?

425
00:43:34,481 --> 00:43:36,483
Who the fuck do you think
you are? Have you taken
my pillow?

426
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:39,007
Hey!
Have you taken my pillow?

427
00:43:39,094 --> 00:43:40,095
Will you pack it in?

428
00:43:40,182 --> 00:43:41,227
Sit down.
It's all good.

429
00:43:41,749 --> 00:43:43,533
I can see
that's my fucking pillow!

430
00:43:43,664 --> 00:43:45,753
Pack it in.
Behave yourselves.

431
00:43:47,059 --> 00:43:48,060
I'm telling you,
you've got the wrong guy.

432
00:43:49,496 --> 00:43:51,716
Move your hands off.
That's my fucking pillow!

433
00:43:51,846 --> 00:43:54,196
- And you know full well.
Lads!

434
00:43:54,719 --> 00:43:56,590
- Enough!
It's my pillow!

435
00:43:56,764 --> 00:43:59,332
- Get the fuck off me.
- It's just a pillow.

436
00:44:01,116 --> 00:44:02,117
Move back!

437
00:44:03,902 --> 00:44:05,338
You two,
behave yourselves.

438
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,515
The whole city's gone under.

439
00:44:09,298 --> 00:44:12,954
It's just sewage
and dead animals.

440
00:44:13,868 --> 00:44:15,217
And we almost left it too late.

441
00:44:16,262 --> 00:44:18,351
I don't know why.
I just thought we could...

442
00:44:18,481 --> 00:44:20,701
I just thought we could sit it
out or something, you know?

443
00:44:20,962 --> 00:44:22,877
- Mm-hmm.
- Everybody did.

444
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:26,446
- How old?
- Er, he's three months.

445
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,404
She's five.

446
00:44:30,972 --> 00:44:33,322
- She's sweet.
She's all right.

447
00:44:33,845 --> 00:44:35,281
I'm not gonna throw her
out of a window,

448
00:44:35,368 --> 00:44:36,848
but she's gotta stay cute.

449
00:44:36,935 --> 00:44:38,110
Oh!

450
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,592
We've been here a month.

451
00:44:44,203 --> 00:44:45,421
There are worse places.

452
00:44:46,901 --> 00:44:49,338
Like, actually.
I've been in them.

453
00:44:49,643 --> 00:44:52,254
We were in one before here
and a refuge before that.

454
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:54,343
That's a lot to cram
in five months.

455
00:44:54,474 --> 00:44:58,870
Oh, yeah. She's busy. Got plans.

456
00:45:00,219 --> 00:45:02,090
That woman, the woman
in the bed next to me,

457
00:45:02,177 --> 00:45:04,876
she had to leave.
Raiders stole all her food.

458
00:45:04,963 --> 00:45:07,617
Too slow. Oh!

459
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:12,535
As soon
as she was born, he bailed.

460
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,498
Took one look at the pair of us
and said, "No, not having that."

461
00:45:20,587 --> 00:45:22,284
I guess I should be
in shock still.

462
00:45:22,415 --> 00:45:23,633
But then all of this happened

463
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:27,202
and I genuinely
couldn't give a shit.

464
00:45:35,254 --> 00:45:36,821
He's probably dead.

465
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:39,562
Yeah, he would have panicked.

466
00:45:43,305 --> 00:45:44,567
He can't swim.

467
00:45:47,222 --> 00:45:48,441
He would have been terrified.

468
00:45:48,702 --> 00:45:50,922
Absolutely shitting himself.

469
00:45:53,881 --> 00:45:55,187
I hope it was quick.

470
00:45:58,146 --> 00:46:00,627
Where's your, er... Dead, probably.

471
00:46:01,671 --> 00:46:03,456
I mean, maybe. I don't know.

472
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,113
I mean, I don't know.
He isn't here.

473
00:46:20,125 --> 00:46:21,256
You know what? You go.

474
00:46:21,691 --> 00:46:23,606
I'll hold him
and then we can switch.

475
00:46:23,693 --> 00:46:24,956
Are you sure?
- Yeah.

476
00:46:30,918 --> 00:46:32,877
<i>Lights out at 9:00 p.m.</i>

477
00:46:32,964 --> 00:46:34,182
Thank you.

478
00:46:42,669 --> 00:46:44,497
Where is he?

479
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:33,589
Fuck!

480
00:47:41,728 --> 00:47:42,642
Fuck's sake.

481
00:48:11,932 --> 00:48:16,284
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

482
00:48:16,415 --> 00:48:19,766
For God's sake.

483
00:48:27,165 --> 00:48:28,557
Come on. Come on.

484
00:48:28,688 --> 00:48:31,125
Are you okay? He needs milk.

485
00:48:33,562 --> 00:48:36,130
Shut the fuck up.
No, you shut up, dude.

486
00:48:37,523 --> 00:48:38,393
Come here.

487
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:00,938
Yes!

488
00:49:01,025 --> 00:49:02,635
A little sheep sound.

489
00:49:02,765 --> 00:49:04,158
Ooh!

490
00:49:04,637 --> 00:49:07,814
The trees!

491
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:08,902
What's that?

492
00:49:12,297 --> 00:49:15,778
It's so perfect.

493
00:49:16,692 --> 00:49:19,347
She's coming to get you, Zeb.
Here she comes.

494
00:49:21,654 --> 00:49:23,308
There's this commune
on an island.

495
00:49:23,438 --> 00:49:25,701
Right, course.
I know.

496
00:49:25,832 --> 00:49:27,399
Of course there's
a fucking commune on an island

497
00:49:27,486 --> 00:49:29,836
that's full of rich people
making sourdough.

498
00:49:30,184 --> 00:49:31,229
And my friend is there.

499
00:49:31,316 --> 00:49:34,406
She's one
of the founding members.

500
00:49:35,624 --> 00:49:37,713
That's a thing.
That's how she talks.

501
00:49:37,844 --> 00:49:38,845
Okay.

502
00:49:39,193 --> 00:49:41,369
She used to be
in stocks and shares and...

503
00:49:42,631 --> 00:49:44,894
I don't know
what I'm talking about.
Can you tell?

504
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:48,376
I mean, I used to blow-dry
politicians' hair

505
00:49:48,507 --> 00:49:51,684
before they spoke
about the economy
on breakfast television.

506
00:49:52,902 --> 00:49:54,469
- We're doomed.
- Yeah.

507
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:57,690
She had some sort
of epiphany one day.

508
00:49:58,734 --> 00:50:01,824
Not like...
like a religious thing.

509
00:50:01,955 --> 00:50:04,349
More like, "Oh, fuck.
What am I doing with my life?"

510
00:50:04,436 --> 00:50:06,873
"Like, does this actually have
meaning or..."

511
00:50:08,527 --> 00:50:11,704
Mm. And so she just decides
she's not fucking doing that
any more,

512
00:50:11,834 --> 00:50:13,575
and she has all this money,

513
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:17,231
so, well, she goes
and she sets up this commune...

514
00:50:19,364 --> 00:50:21,018
Just have to figure out
how to get there.

515
00:50:23,411 --> 00:50:24,499
You should come.

516
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:25,674
What?

517
00:50:43,301 --> 00:50:50,003
Can we go to sleep now, please?

518
00:51:23,254 --> 00:51:25,647
Keep moving!
Just keep moving!

519
00:51:25,734 --> 00:51:27,084
Move! Move! Move!

520
00:51:33,046 --> 00:51:34,787
Come on.
- Where are you going?

521
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:42,316
Oi, oi, look at this.
A few more over here.

522
00:51:42,447 --> 00:51:43,883
Bring that bag.
I've got this one.

523
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:44,971
Faster.
Check in there, man.

524
00:51:45,058 --> 00:51:47,365
Check in there.

525
00:51:48,061 --> 00:51:49,628
Where are you going?

526
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:59,028
Hey! What are they doing?
- Please, please!

527
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,856
Get out!
They've got babies.

528
00:52:00,943 --> 00:52:02,206
Just drive.
Come on.

529
00:52:02,336 --> 00:52:03,859
Fuck.
Go, go, go!

530
00:52:18,352 --> 00:52:20,485
Can you slow down? Please?

531
00:52:29,755 --> 00:52:31,278
Actually,
we can get out here.

532
00:52:35,456 --> 00:52:36,849
Stop the fucking car.

533
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:51,385
I'm here. I'm here.

534
00:52:55,781 --> 00:52:57,826
Cunts.

535
00:53:02,962 --> 00:53:04,398
He's gonna go back
to the shelter

536
00:53:04,485 --> 00:53:07,096
- and we won't be there.
Try not to think about it.

537
00:53:09,011 --> 00:53:10,448
I feel sick.

538
00:53:11,144 --> 00:53:12,624
Yeah,
that's because you're starving.

539
00:53:13,146 --> 00:53:14,539
Have we eaten
everything?

540
00:53:15,104 --> 00:53:17,150
We have
these delicious babies.

541
00:53:18,978 --> 00:53:20,458
They are delicious.

542
00:53:22,677 --> 00:53:24,679
We'll find something.

543
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,436
There's no food.

544
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:45,874
It's all right. Come on.

545
00:54:01,934 --> 00:54:02,891
Hello?

546
00:54:06,852 --> 00:54:07,766
Hi.

547
00:54:08,723 --> 00:54:10,812
Hi.

548
00:54:11,422 --> 00:54:15,774
I have food.

549
00:54:32,921 --> 00:54:33,792
Here.

550
00:54:39,798 --> 00:54:41,016
Thank you.

551
00:54:45,325 --> 00:54:46,195
Mm.

552
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:49,764
I'll just... Mm. Thank you.

553
00:54:54,334 --> 00:54:55,814
Where... where are you going?

554
00:54:56,684 --> 00:54:59,383
Not sure.

555
00:54:59,513 --> 00:55:01,602
- And you're traveling alone?
I am.

556
00:55:02,255 --> 00:55:03,778
We're heading
to my friend's commune.

557
00:55:04,475 --> 00:55:05,824
Do you know if we're
near the coast?

558
00:55:07,434 --> 00:55:09,349
Well, there are communes
on all the islands,

559
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,395
so, you want to head
to the northern pier.

560
00:55:11,525 --> 00:55:12,961
That's where I got
the boat from, at least.

561
00:55:13,048 --> 00:55:14,876
But...
...she might have stopped.

562
00:55:14,963 --> 00:55:15,964
I... I don't know.

563
00:55:16,095 --> 00:55:17,749
- You've been to one?
Yeah.

564
00:55:17,879 --> 00:55:19,446
What?

565
00:55:25,278 --> 00:55:27,454
No, it's... They're perfect.

566
00:55:27,541 --> 00:55:29,326
It's exactly where you wanna be
with your child.

567
00:55:31,066 --> 00:55:32,285
Why did you leave, then?

568
00:55:37,551 --> 00:55:39,205
Because they wanted to forget.

569
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:42,208
And...

570
00:55:43,209 --> 00:55:47,431
I don't want
to forget before, so...

571
00:56:07,886 --> 00:56:10,236

592
00:57:24,745 --> 00:57:25,964
It was my fault.

593
00:57:28,836 --> 00:57:30,882
I thought we'd be safer
near a city,

594
00:57:30,969 --> 00:57:32,753
but then we just
didn't get out in time.

595
00:57:38,063 --> 00:57:40,195
It was a bridge. Er...

596
00:57:42,807 --> 00:57:44,156
It was strange. It was so...

597
00:57:46,593 --> 00:57:48,595
simple, straightforward. Um...

598
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,078
I was...

599
00:57:54,296 --> 00:57:55,210
at the end.

600
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:56,821
They were in the middle,
all three of them.

601
00:57:59,954 --> 00:58:01,347
She had both of them...

602
00:58:04,132 --> 00:58:06,047
in her arms,
and then they weren't there.

603
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,406
It was just... just dust.

604
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:28,243
Underneath them there was water.
Water.  Rubble.

605
00:58:31,682 --> 00:58:33,684
And then there were people
running and screaming.

606
00:58:39,951 --> 00:58:42,388
I'm, erm... I'm gonna go back.

607
00:58:45,347 --> 00:58:48,046
I'm going to go back to the city
to where they were.

608
00:58:54,443 --> 00:58:56,707
- I think it'll be sharper there.
- Hmm.

609
00:58:59,187 --> 00:59:00,188
Sharper?

610
00:59:07,587 --> 00:59:10,242
It's fine. I don't speak
to people for days on end.

611
00:59:10,372 --> 00:59:11,417
And then...

612
00:59:13,506 --> 00:59:15,160
when you were dancing
just then...

613
00:59:23,429 --> 00:59:24,865
Thank you.

614
00:59:29,783 --> 00:59:30,741
Thank you.

615
00:59:33,787 --> 00:59:34,614
Hmm.

616
00:59:38,183 --> 00:59:40,228
Good night.
Good night.

617
00:59:43,971 --> 00:59:44,885
Oh.

618
01:00:59,786 --> 01:01:00,918
Good morning.

619
01:01:08,926 --> 01:01:12,799
Why are you so awake?

620
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:19,327
<i>â™ª I swear it's the truth
And I owe it all to you â™ª</i>

621
01:01:19,458 --> 01:01:20,720

622
01:01:20,851 --> 01:01:22,461

623
01:01:22,591 --> 01:01:24,202

01:01:24,332 --> 01:01:25,638
<i>â™ª Hit it, baby! â™ª</i>

625
01:01:25,769 --> 01:01:28,206
What's the part where
they say "The passion"?

626
01:01:28,336 --> 01:01:29,511
Oh, no, we did that?

627
01:01:29,642 --> 01:01:31,339
<i>â™ª This could be love â™ª</i>

628
01:01:31,470 --> 01:01:35,256
<i>â™ª Because I've had â™ª</i>

629
01:01:35,387 --> 01:01:38,259
<i>â™ª The time of my life â™ª</i>

630
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:39,652
<i>â™ª No, I never... â™ª</i>

631
01:01:43,656 --> 01:01:46,354
This is it.
The northern pier.

632
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:02,762
What's up here?
Hmm? What's up this way?

633
01:02:04,851 --> 01:02:06,897
He said
wait here until she comes.

634
01:02:09,377 --> 01:02:11,684
- Yeah.
- And if she doesn't?

635
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:14,643
She will.

636
01:02:17,864 --> 01:02:20,519
She will. Yeah, she will.

637
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:31,051
She will come.

638
01:02:37,318 --> 01:02:38,363
She will come.

639
01:02:45,892 --> 01:02:46,806
Hey.

640
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:52,769
She will come.

641
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:24,164
Fuck.

642
01:04:44,054 --> 01:04:45,098
Hello!

643
01:04:48,928 --> 01:04:51,452
Hello!

644
01:04:52,105 --> 01:04:55,630
Hello! We're here!

645
01:04:55,979 --> 01:04:58,155
Something's coming!
Something's coming.

646
01:04:58,503 --> 01:05:00,374
Something's coming!

647
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:05,423
Something's coming!

648
01:06:04,221 --> 01:06:05,439
Hi!

649
01:06:06,484 --> 01:06:07,789
Oh,
you made it.

650
01:06:08,268 --> 01:06:10,270
Hello. Oh, my God,
you're here.

651
01:06:10,357 --> 01:06:12,620
My girls.
How's your baby?

652
01:06:14,666 --> 01:06:17,103
She's so cute.
How was your journey?

653
01:06:41,606 --> 01:06:43,260
Do you want to go
and have some dinner?

654
01:06:44,348 --> 01:06:45,349
What?

655
01:06:46,045 --> 01:06:47,481
Do you want to go
and have some dinner?

656
01:06:49,483 --> 01:06:50,484
Now?

657
01:06:52,095 --> 01:06:55,968
Oh, yeah. Yeah,
I think so. Don't you?

658
01:06:56,882 --> 01:07:00,103
- Well, I don't know you.
- I don't know you either.

659
01:07:05,456 --> 01:07:06,544
It could be a disaster.

660
01:07:07,632 --> 01:07:13,203
<i>â™ª Baby now let me hold you tight
My love... â™ª</i>

661
01:07:26,607 --> 01:07:28,218
Are you hungry? We've got food.

662
01:07:28,348 --> 01:07:30,350
You can eat
some of my birthday cake.

663
01:07:30,481 --> 01:07:33,397
And this is my friend.
- Hiya!

664
01:07:33,527 --> 01:07:35,442
Is she coming?

665
01:07:38,706 --> 01:07:40,099
Mine looks better
than yours.

666
01:07:40,534 --> 01:07:41,622
Girls,
make yourselves useful.

667
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:42,971
<i>Meteorologists
have today announced</i>

668
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:45,626
<i>the worst of the extreme storms
have finally passed.</i>

669
01:07:45,757 --> 01:07:47,672
<i>This long-awaited news
has paved the way</i>

670
01:07:47,759 --> 01:07:49,239
<i>for the launch
of the official operation</i>

671
01:07:49,369 --> 01:07:51,458
<i>to begin rebuilding our nation.</i>

672
01:07:51,806 --> 01:07:54,287
<i>Bath and other low-lying cities
least affected</i>

673
01:07:54,418 --> 01:07:57,029
<i>are already allowing residents
to return home.</i>

674
01:07:57,508 --> 01:08:00,685
<i>The mayor of London has praised
those who are working tirelessly</i>

675
01:08:00,815 --> 01:08:02,861
<i>to make London safe enough
for civilians</i>

676
01:08:02,991 --> 01:08:05,342
<i>to join the big clean-up
of our capital,</i>

677
01:08:05,429 --> 01:08:08,388
<i>which he believes will be
achievable in the coming weeks.</i>

678
01:08:08,562 --> 01:08:10,999
<i>And, finally,
in a bid to reunite families,</i>

679
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:14,394
<i>a missing network has been
set up at every super shelter.</i>

680
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:17,310
<i>The hope is by creating
a centralized list,</i>

681
01:08:17,441 --> 01:08:19,007
<i>families will finally
be reunited...</i>

682
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:20,270
Can you turn that off, please?

683
01:08:20,357 --> 01:08:22,576
<i>...may also aid
the identification of the...</i>

684
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:23,751
Course.

685
01:08:26,711 --> 01:08:28,104
Can you hand me your bowl, sweetie?

686
01:08:28,452 --> 01:08:30,541
Thank you. Sorry.

687
01:08:45,425 --> 01:08:47,471
This is nice.
Thank you.

688
01:08:47,688 --> 01:08:50,387
I put leeks in
to give it a wee bit...

689
01:08:50,517 --> 01:08:51,910
When we first
got together,

690
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:54,913
I had this breakdown, I guess.

691
01:08:56,697 --> 01:08:58,438
Yeah, my parents had just died,

692
01:08:58,569 --> 01:09:01,441
both very suddenly,
like, very close together,

693
01:09:02,225 --> 01:09:03,835
and I became terrified of death.

694
01:09:04,227 --> 01:09:07,099
I mean, irrationally,
completely,

695
01:09:07,621 --> 01:09:09,754
overwhelmed
by the fear of dying.

696
01:09:09,928 --> 01:09:12,148
Doesn't sound irrational.

697
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:15,977
No, and emotionally,

698
01:09:17,109 --> 01:09:20,852
I mean, of course, emotionally,
it made complete sense.

699
01:09:20,982 --> 01:09:22,114
But logically...

700
01:09:23,724 --> 01:09:25,726
I mean, at that time,
logically, the world,

701
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:29,295
it offered no real threat and...

702
01:09:33,386 --> 01:09:34,953
God, I couldn't get out of bed.

703
01:09:37,651 --> 01:09:38,826
He was so kind.

704
01:09:42,265 --> 01:09:44,528
I mean, he looked after me
so brilliantly.

705
01:09:49,010 --> 01:09:51,099
We didn't even know each other
that well.

706
01:09:52,536 --> 01:09:55,321
We hadn't known each other
long enough to. Just...

707
01:09:57,671 --> 01:09:58,716
I get it.

708
01:09:59,543 --> 01:10:01,806
I went on this mad
"I want a baby" quest.

709
01:10:01,936 --> 01:10:03,895
Yeah.
- No, I didn't stop.

710
01:10:04,591 --> 01:10:05,853
I mean,
I didn't grieve properly.

711
01:10:05,984 --> 01:10:08,900
Just head down, get pregnant.

712
01:10:08,987 --> 01:10:11,163
Get through it.
Get through it and...

713
01:10:16,168 --> 01:10:17,343
But I think I only wanted one

714
01:10:17,430 --> 01:10:19,432
so I could stop being so afraid
of dying.

715
01:10:23,567 --> 01:10:25,177
You know, so I could have
something of my own

716
01:10:25,264 --> 01:10:28,528
that I would die for
in a heartbeat, in a second.

717
01:10:29,094 --> 01:10:30,313
Sounds okay.

718
01:10:30,748 --> 01:10:33,490
I don't think anyone has a baby
for altruistic reasons.

719
01:10:41,411 --> 01:10:42,716
He was wanted.

720
01:10:43,978 --> 01:10:46,764
A version of him was wanted.

721
01:10:48,461 --> 01:10:50,768
Hmm.

722
01:10:52,073 --> 01:10:53,771
But the fear of death
doesn't go away.

723
01:10:55,555 --> 01:10:56,948
No.
- It spreads.

724
01:10:58,384 --> 01:10:59,603
Pulls the baby in.

725
01:11:01,692 --> 01:11:04,303
And now look.

726
01:11:04,956 --> 01:11:07,611
What a world.

727
01:11:09,961 --> 01:11:12,093
Here, you have
an eyelash on your face.

728
01:11:14,357 --> 01:11:15,793
- Make a wish.
- You do.

729
01:11:58,966 --> 01:12:00,794
Yeah, so,
work sort of sent me here.

730
01:12:01,534 --> 01:12:05,016
I'm more of a, kind of,
"Build your own hut,
eat and kill some roadkill."

731
01:12:05,625 --> 01:12:07,323
Thank you.
What, eat and then kill?

732
01:12:07,932 --> 01:12:10,630
Yeah, that doesn't...
Yeah. Yeah, eat it to death.

733
01:12:10,935 --> 01:12:12,676
- Normal. The normal way.
Yeah.

734
01:12:13,416 --> 01:12:16,767
Uh, I...
I think that's impressed you.

735
01:12:16,941 --> 01:12:19,291
Yeah.

736
01:12:19,422 --> 01:12:21,467
- You've totally won me over. Hmm.
Yeah.

737
01:12:22,163 --> 01:12:24,078
What about you?
Do you like living here?

738
01:12:24,601 --> 01:12:27,647
Uh, yeah, I love it.
Mm. I, uh...

739
01:12:29,388 --> 01:12:31,042
I really like being indoors.

740
01:12:32,217 --> 01:12:37,570
Mm. Like going into shops,
and ordering food from menus

741
01:12:37,657 --> 01:12:39,311
that someone else has cooked...

742
01:12:39,442 --> 01:12:41,269
Okay....in a cooker.

743
01:12:41,574 --> 01:12:43,620
Or even a microwave. I'm not...

744
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:45,143
Okay....I'm not fussy.

745
01:12:45,970 --> 01:12:48,015
Well, we're doomed,
then, really, aren't we?

746
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:51,192
Yeah. Yeah,
there's... there's no hope.

747
01:12:51,715 --> 01:12:54,108
It's a shame.

748
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,215
You're not here.

749
01:13:15,956 --> 01:13:17,567
Sorry.

750
01:13:24,051 --> 01:13:25,879
Some people find it harder.

751
01:13:28,926 --> 01:13:30,231
They have more to give up.

752
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:37,413
It is difficult,
but this doesn't work.

753
01:13:37,543 --> 01:13:40,851
It stops working for everybody
if one person isn't present.

754
01:13:47,553 --> 01:13:49,076
It isn't real any more.

755
01:13:52,210 --> 01:13:54,125

- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

- Yeah.

763
01:17:04,358 --> 01:17:06,796
No. Of course I'm not
gonna leave the baby here.

764

What, are you fucking insane?

765

You can't take him with you.

what you're going back to.

- I'm his food.

Not if you fucking starve.
- No, no, this is not my place.

769
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:20,505
This isn't me.

770
01:17:20,592 --> 01:17:22,333

what this means.

771

fucking rejection

- No, I have to tell
my son I tried.

774
01:17:29,383 --> 01:17:32,299
That I didn't just hide from it
or pretend nothing happened.

775
01:17:32,430 --> 01:17:33,431
Okay.

01:29:47,469 --> 01:29:49,035
There I am, yes.

878
01:30:05,878 --> 01:30:07,663
I don't know where I am.

879
01:30:11,884 --> 01:30:13,103
Where am I, Zeb?

880
01:30:14,713 --> 01:30:18,021
I don't know.

881
01:30:21,372 --> 01:30:24,375
I don't know.

882
01:30:24,506 --> 01:30:28,161
Mommy doesn't know.

883
01:31:39,624 --> 01:31:40,930
Hello.
- Hi.

884
01:32:29,587 --> 01:32:32,721
This is gonna be
a big clean-up, Zeb.

885
01:32:34,461 --> 01:32:36,115
I might need a hand with this.

886
01:32:36,812 --> 01:32:40,555
This was yours.
You're too big for that now.

887
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:50,782
It's still beautiful.

888
01:33:02,402 --> 01:33:06,711
Right.

889
01:33:07,930 --> 01:33:09,627
Would you like
to see the kitchen?

890
01:33:14,545 --> 01:33:17,374
Oh, thank you.
That's okay. You have it.

891
01:33:24,468 --> 01:33:26,209
Are you just gonna
watch me work?

892
01:33:27,558 --> 01:33:28,951
I like your style.

893
01:33:30,561 --> 01:33:33,346
I like your style.

894
01:33:51,060 --> 01:33:52,017
Hello?

895
01:34:31,491 --> 01:34:32,492
Oh, my...

896
01:34:36,366 --> 01:34:37,323
Hello.

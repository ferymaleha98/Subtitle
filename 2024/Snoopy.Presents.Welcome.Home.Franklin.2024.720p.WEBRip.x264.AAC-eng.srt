3
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:31,823
{\an8}We're in the lead.

4
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:39,790
Hi. I'm Franklin.

5
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,543
Franklin Armstrong,
if you wanna be formal about it.

6
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:47,089
Have you ever thought to yourself,
"How did I end up in this situation?"

7
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:51,426
In order to understand how I got here,
let me take you back a little.

8
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:57,266
<i>You see, my dad serves in the military.</i>

9
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:59,893
{\an8}<i>It always keeps my family on the move.</i>

10
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:05,107
<i>Grandpa always told me,
"Don't try to fight change,</i>

11
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,775
<i>because change is undefeated."</i>

12
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:10,487
I'm coming.

13
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:19,496
<i>I've lived in a lot of different places
but none that I can call home.</i>

14
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,626
<i>The hardest part
is saying goodbye to all of my friends.</i>

15
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:26,295
Hey, Franklin.

16
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:28,964
Hey. You guys came to say goodbye?

17
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:31,383
You're leaving?

18
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:34,011
Do you still have my basketball?

19
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,390
Sorry about that.

20
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,142
Thanks. See ya.

21
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:43,520
Yeah. See ya.

22
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,146
<i>So this was it. Our new town.</i>

23
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,731
<i>For now, anyways.</i>

24
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:42,079
<i>One thing was for sure.
There was a lack of variety in this place.</i>

25
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:02,307
<i>Another thing about
never staying in one place too long is</i>

26
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:05,435
<i>you never want to completely unpack
your suitcase.</i>

27
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:08,814
That was fun. Same time tomorrow?

28
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,274
You bet.

29
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:13,819
<i>Some say making new friends can be hard.</i>

30
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:18,198
<i>But it's a breeze with this handy
little notebook my grandpa gave me.</i>

31
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:21,785
<i>It has all his favorite tips
on how to break the ice.</i>

32
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:26,665
<i>I've done this so many times now,
this will be a piece of cake.</i>

33
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:43,640
"You can never go wrong
if you start with a good joke.

34
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,935
And remember,
don't forget to dial up the personality."

35
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:49,938
Here we go again.

36
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:02,242
Hi there. I'm Franklin Armstrong.

37
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,495
Hello there. I'm Linus.

38
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,372
It's nice to meet you.

39
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,291
Wanna hear a funny joke?

40
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,584
Yeah, sure.

41
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,045
How does the ocean say hello?

42
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,341
I haven't the slightest.

43
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:20,552
It waves.

44
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,181
Get it?

45
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,101
Wordplay. Funny.

46
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:33,649
What are you up to out here?
You gonna make a pumpkin pie?

47
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:37,903
No, never.
I'm tending to my pumpkin patch.

48
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:41,031
It needs to be more sincere than ever
this year.

49
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,409
I happen to have
a little gardening experience.

50
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:45,702
Would you like some help?

51
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,621
Sure. That would be great.

52
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,540
Fall is just around the corner,

53
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,334
and these pumpkins
are going to need lots of work

54
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,419
to get ready for the Great Pumpkin.

55
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:56,129
The great what?

56
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:57,381
The Great Pumpkin.

57
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:01,593
The Great Pumpkin rises out of
the most sincere pumpkin patch

58
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:04,346
and brings gifts
to all the good little children.

59
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,308
This year, he has to pick mine.

60
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:11,436
Can't you just feel the sincerity
all around here?

61
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,523
I think this one looks very sincere.

62
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,651
You weren't supposed to
pick it off the vine.

63
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,737
The Great Pumpkin will never
choose me after this.

64
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,781
I'm doomed!

65
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,451
Tell the big pumpkin I'm sorry.

66
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:36,128
Page 14.
"To make friends, don't forget to smile.

67
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:40,090
{\an8}And remember, a well-placed compliment
can go a long way."

68
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:49,349
{\an8}Fresh lemonade. How wonderful.

69
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,649
{\an8}Delicious.

70
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,819
{\an8}How much for a refill?

71
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:04,323
{\an8}Hey! Just what do you think you're doing?

72
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:09,328
{\an8}Do you have any idea how long it took me
to squeeze all those lemons?

73
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:12,581
{\an8}I'm sorry. But isn't that part of the job?

74
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,708
{\an8}Read the sign.

75
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,878
I deal in psychiatry, not lemonade.

76
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,881
{\an8}Smile. Compliment.

77
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,635
{\an8}Psychiatry? Interesting.

78
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,471
{\an8}Do you have many clients?
What do you talk about?

79
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:32,392
{\an8}I can't tell you that.
Doctor-patient confidentiality.

80
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,813
{\an8}Have you heard how the ocean says hello?

81
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:41,568
Yeah, yeah. It waves. That's an old one.

82
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:45,614
Listen, kid. If you're looking
for some professional help, take a number.

83
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:47,282
I dabble in it all.

84
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:51,995
Anxiety, phobias, lack of confidence
and what have you.

85
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,499
Now, if you'll excuse me,
my eleven o'clock is here.

86
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,251
Germophile.

87
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,754
Hello, Pigpen. Have a seat.

88
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:02,005
Pigpen?

89
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,638
I don't understand.

90
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:12,558
It's never been this hard
to make friends before.

91
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:16,311
My notebook normally tells me
all the right things to say.

92
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:17,896
But not with this crowd.

93
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,190
A delusional pseudo doctor,

94
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:23,735
a devotee of someone
called the Great Pumpkin

95
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,446
and a kid whose parents named them Pigpen?

96
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:31,785
Boy, aren't you a sight for sore eyes.

97
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:34,580
Dogs sure do make the world
a better place.

98
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:38,125
Finally, a little sense of normalcy
around here.

99
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:52,472
If I didn't know better,
I'd swear I was in the twilight zone.

100
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:58,747
Is this your beach ball?

101
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:01,792
That thing sure has a mind of its own.

102
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,210
Thank you for catching it.

103
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,087
You're welcome.

104
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,673
I'm Franklin. Franklin Armstrong.

105
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,550
My name is Charlie Brown.

106
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:10,634
Thanks again.

107
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:15,639
Do you want
to see my sandcastle, Franklin?

108
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,269
Are you here with your family on vacation?

109
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:22,771
Actually, we just moved here.

110
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:26,191
My dad serves in the military,
and he was just reassigned.

111
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:29,194
Oh, yeah? My dad was in the service too.

112
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:30,612
He's a barber now.

113
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:33,615
Smart.
You can never run out of hair to cut.

114
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:36,827
What do you think, Franklin?

115
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:46,587
Do you know how the ocean says hello?

116
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:48,922
It waves.

117
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:55,637
I hear my mom calling me.
I have to go now.

118
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,473
Maybe if you're free tomorrow, we could--

119
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,567
See you later, Mom.

120
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,736
I'm sure things will go better today too.

121
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:18,243
"If you wanna meet new friends,
find out where your new friends meet."

122
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:27,085
Pizza. Of course. Who doesn't like pizza?

123
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,901
And you should have seen him.

124
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,320
Without even saying a howdy-do,

125
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,865
he walked right up
and drank all my lemonade.

126
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,243
Who does that?

127
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:02,871
I can't go in there.

128
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:05,249
What can I say?

129
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,251
Hey, kid, look out!

130
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:08,544
Out of the way!

131
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:15,717
What's going on?

132
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:17,970
- Did you see what happened?
- What was that?

133
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,305
What have you got there, Shermy?

134
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:25,227
We were just doing a little trial run
of our soapbox derby car.

135
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,062
The steering could use some work.

136
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:28,021
What?

137
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:32,192
Where have you all been? The big
soapbox derby race is coming to town.

138
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:37,531
The winning team gets a trophy
and free pizza for a whole year.

139
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,825
Soapbox derby race?

140
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,076
A trophy?

141
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,494
Free pizza!

142
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:51,670
"Franklin, a surefire way to make friends
is to show them that you're a winner.

143
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,505
Everybody likes a winner."

144
00:11:54,298 --> 00:11:56,508
All I need now is to find a partner.

145
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:58,927
- This is going to--
- Want to team up?

146
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:01,138
- Sure.
- That trophy is going to be ours.

147
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,264
Do you wanna--

148
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:04,308
Do you wanna be my--

149
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,392
Marcie!

150
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:09,938
Excuse me. Do you wanna be my--

151
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:13,442
- Do you have a--
- Oh, Schroeder!

152
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:17,654
What do you say, Snoopy? Partners?

153
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,247
You snooze you lose, Chuck.

154
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:31,210
Can you imagine
Charlie Brown behind the wheel?

155
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:33,795
He can't even mow the lawn straight.

156
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:43,180
Hello again. Remember me from the beach?

157
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,474
Of course I do, Franklin.

158
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:48,644
Well, what do you think, Charlie Brown?
Partners?

159
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:51,688
Partners.

160
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,652
I can't wait to get started.

161
00:12:58,362 --> 00:12:59,363
Hey!

162
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:04,743
To build our car,
we're going to need a lot of stuff.

163
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:07,829
Nails, plywood, glue.

164
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:33,021
Well, this is certainly awkward.

165
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:34,982
You're that lemonade girl.

166
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:37,776
If you'll excuse me,

167
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,571
I need this steering wheel
for my soapbox derby car.

168
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:43,824
And you know the rules. Ladies first.

169
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:45,284
So give it here.

170
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:48,579
But my partner said
he specifically wanted this one.

171
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:51,206
Oh, yeah? And who might this partner be?

172
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,041
A boy named Charlie Brown.

173
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:57,504
Charlie Brown?
Aren't you in for a treat.

174
00:13:57,588 --> 00:13:59,006
What's that supposed to mean?

175
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:00,591
You'll see.

176
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,050
Where is he, by the way?

177
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:04,219
Already throwing in the towel?

178
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:08,724
No. He's out at the scrapyard
gathering supplies for our car.

179
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:09,933
Well, good luck to you,

180
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:12,603
'cause you're going to need
a lot more than this steering wheel

181
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:15,022
to win with Charlie Brown as your partner.

182
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:17,649
Save it. We don't need any luck.

183
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:20,569
That's true. You need a miracle.

184
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,655
It's all yours, newbie.

185
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:29,870
Here's my card. You may need
someone to talk to after the race.

186
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,725
Thanks for letting me borrow your tools,
Dad.

187
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:54,520
Hi, Franklin.

188
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:57,231
There he is. Hi, Charlie Brown.

189
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:03,654
What's the old plumbing pipe for?

190
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:06,198
I was looking at pictures of old hot rods

191
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:09,493
and they all had pipes like this
coming out of the sides.

192
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,328
Now, that's clever.

193
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:15,207
It won't help us go faster, but
it sure will psych out the competition.

194
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:21,088
These weren't quite what I had
in mind when I said to find some wheels.

195
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:23,590
They're not gonna work if we wanna win.

196
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,136
But the wheels of your wagon
would be perfect.

197
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,221
Really?

198
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:32,641
I don't know. This is my sister's wagon.

199
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:36,979
Technically, you're only
borrowing the wheels for a few days.

200
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:39,147
And we really need them.

201
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:43,235
We'll replace them after the race
and her wagon will be as good as new.

202
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:46,905
It looks like we have our wheels.

203
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:49,116
Great. Let's get to building.

204
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:57,249
"A great way to build a friendship
is to find common interests."

205
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,127
So you said you like baseball?

206
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,504
Absolutely. What about you?

207
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:05,674
I come from a long line
of baseball players.

208
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,553
My great-uncle Eugene Benson
played in the Negro Leagues.

209
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:11,471
What's that?

210
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:13,056
Well, there was a time

211
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:17,102
when Black and white baseball players
weren't allowed to play together.

212
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:20,147
So the Black players formed
their own league.

213
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,482
It's where Jackie Robinson used to play.

214
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:27,946
Wow. A kid can really learn a lot
hanging around with you, Franklin.

215
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:34,453
By the way, I happen to
manage my own baseball team.

216
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:36,455
Yeah? You guys any good?

217
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:40,334
My motto is,
"You don't need to win to finish first."

218
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,504
Never heard of that one before.

219
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,798
My grandpa used to say to me,

220
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:50,344
"Franklin, it's better to build stuff
than to buy stuff."

221
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:54,556
My grandpa says that too.
Usually around Christmas and birthdays.

222
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:58,310
Pliers, please?

223
00:16:58,894 --> 00:17:01,313
Hey, Franklin,
what kind of music do you like?

224
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:05,858
My favorites are Stevie Wonder,
Little Richard and, of course,

225
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:08,654
the godfather of soul, James Brown.

226
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,198
You're not related, are you?

227
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:13,325
I don't believe so.

228
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,454
But here's what I'm into lately.

229
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,330
It's John Coltrane.

230
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:22,501
Listen closely, Charlie Brown.

231
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:25,337
Jazz has harmonies that stay consistent.

232
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:26,880
But pay attention.

233
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:30,008
It has other parts
that are always being improvised.

234
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:31,134
Can you feel it?

235
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:35,848
I like it.

236
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:06,503
Thanks.

237
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:13,051
Have you ever thought about what
you would like to be when you grow up?

238
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:16,930
I'm not sure, Charlie Brown.
But I always have liked outer space.

239
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:21,518
Maybe one day, I could get to go up there.
Like Neil Armstrong.

240
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:25,105
Armstrong? Any relation?

241
00:18:26,148 --> 00:18:27,482
Good one.

242
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:29,818
What about you, Charlie Brown?

243
00:18:29,902 --> 00:18:32,696
I've often thought
I'd like to be a pro ballplayer.

244
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,365
You get to go to new cities all the time.

245
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:38,368
You're always on the move. What a life.

246
00:18:39,578 --> 00:18:41,205
I've moved a lot.

247
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:45,501
And trust me, a life on the road
might sound nice, Charlie Brown,

248
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:47,920
but it's not so great.

249
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:53,050
Hey, you know what we need?
A secret handshake.

250
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:56,053
Not like that.

251
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:20,118
Camouflaging our car
was a brilliant idea, Franklin.

252
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:22,913
Yeah. We don't want anyone
stealing our awesome design

253
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,623
while we're doing our test run.

254
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:32,714
Sir, drag increases
as the square of speed.

255
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:36,009
Our design's success relies on
a knowledge of physics.

256
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:40,556
That's all fine and dandy, Marcie,
but think "monster truck."

257
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:45,352
Raise the mast, Pigpen.

258
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:49,481
Like Magellan's trusty ship the <i>Victoria</i>
circumnavigated the globe,

259
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:53,569
so shall we circumnavigate
the neighborhood to win the race.

260
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:55,863
Can I ask you a question?

261
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:59,408
What's the deal with that kid
and his pumpkin patch?

262
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:01,159
Who? Linus?

263
00:20:01,243 --> 00:20:02,703
He has his quirks.

264
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:06,456
But once you get to know him,
there's no one better.

265
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,166
He's one of my best friends.

266
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:11,670
You must miss your best friend.

267
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:15,674
Who can really say
what a best friend is anyway?

268
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:22,264
Well, in my opinion,
a best friend is special and different.

269
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:27,102
It's someone that you can totally trust,
that always has your back.

270
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:32,316
In some ways, your best friend knows you
better than you know yourself.

271
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,543
That's one strange dog you have there,
Charlie Brown.

272
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:53,420
Tell me about it.

273
00:20:59,218 --> 00:21:01,595
This is a special moment, partner.

274
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:05,057
The first real test of Unstoppable.

275
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:12,272
Systems: Check.

276
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:13,357
Helmets?

277
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:15,442
Check.

278
00:21:15,526 --> 00:21:16,568
Seat belts?

279
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:18,445
Check. Steering?

280
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:21,573
- Check.
- Check.

281
00:21:21,657 --> 00:21:27,120
Roger. We are go for launch
in T-minus three, two, one.

282
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:43,929
We need to slow down.

283
00:21:48,976 --> 00:21:51,645
We can't win
if you keep slamming on the brakes.

284
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:54,064
Let's see what Unstoppable can really do.

285
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:03,907
{\an8}What are you doing?

286
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:06,952
{\an8}Remember, stay off the brakes.

287
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:08,203
Sorry.

288
00:22:15,127 --> 00:22:17,963
{\an8}Don't you dare! I said no brakes.

289
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:20,174
I've got this.

290
00:22:50,996 --> 00:22:51,997
Franklin?

291
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:56,710
Look at what you did.

292
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:58,629
I told you, "Stay off the brakes."

293
00:22:58,712 --> 00:23:01,882
What?
I was trying to prevent us from crashing.

294
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:03,759
Why didn't you listen to me?

295
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:07,471
Man, was lemonade girl
ever right about you.

296
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:08,931
What's that supposed to mean?

297
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,560
Forget it.

298
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:19,107
It's getting late.
I think I'd better head home.

299
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:03,694
There's no bits of wisdom in here
for this situation.

300
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:28,927
Man, now how am I supposed to
make friends in this town?

301
00:24:31,263 --> 00:24:32,681
Who's there?

302
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:37,644
- What are--
- I didn't--

303
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:40,731
No, no. You first.

304
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:45,861
I'm surprised to see you back here,
Charlie Brown.

305
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:50,449
I'm not a quitter,
and I'm not about to start now.

306
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:53,577
I've never won anything before,

307
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,997
and I think we have a good shot
to win this race.

308
00:24:57,748 --> 00:24:58,749
Really?

309
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:01,418
But what about our car?

310
00:25:01,502 --> 00:25:03,712
It really isn't in that bad of shape.

311
00:25:04,588 --> 00:25:07,591
There is still a chance
we can make the race tomorrow

312
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:09,635
if we work together.

313
00:25:10,636 --> 00:25:13,555
You'd still be willing to be my partner?

314
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:15,182
Of course.

315
00:25:22,523 --> 00:25:24,733
- Quickly put that in the car.
- Got that one.

316
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:27,819
- I'll put this one.
- Here. Take this.

317
00:25:27,903 --> 00:25:30,113
It's gonna be a long night.

318
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:36,578
Welcome to the
Champion Soapbox Derby Race.

319
00:25:38,372 --> 00:25:43,585
This is the most amazing
combination of twists, turns and hills

320
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:45,254
to test our racers here today.

321
00:25:45,337 --> 00:25:50,050
A year's worth of pizza's on the line,
but it's more than a delicious meal

322
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:54,346
that challenges these young drivers
at the brink of this 100-foot hill.

323
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:57,641
Go get 'em, my Sweet Babboo.

324
00:26:13,657 --> 00:26:17,160
Come on. Hurry. We're almost out of time.

325
00:26:18,161 --> 00:26:21,999
The 30-second card is up.
The race is about to begin.

326
00:26:22,082 --> 00:26:26,086
{\an8}It's like my grandpa always says,
"You gotta want it to get it."

327
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:29,590
{\an8}So, Charlie Brown, do you want it?

328
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,675
{\an8}Let's go get it.

329
00:26:38,724 --> 00:26:40,267
And we're off!

330
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:48,775
What an exciting start.

331
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:50,777
Lucy and Schroeder take the lead.

332
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:53,739
Right brake now!

333
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:03,123
What a bold move
by Franklin and Charlie Brown.

334
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:05,250
Left!

335
00:27:07,044 --> 00:27:08,170
It's working.

336
00:27:19,932 --> 00:27:21,892
Patty, the steering broke.

337
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:24,019
That wasn't part of the plan.

338
00:27:36,949 --> 00:27:38,492
Eat my dust.

339
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:06,270
Lucy and Schroeder are holding onto first,

340
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:10,482
but Franklin and Charlie Brown
are coming in hot.

341
00:28:10,566 --> 00:28:14,403
Hey, let's stay off the brakes
and lean into the curve.

342
00:28:14,486 --> 00:28:16,113
Are you sure, Charlie Brown?

343
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:17,406
Trust me.

344
00:28:26,832 --> 00:28:27,958
We're in the lead.

345
00:28:32,421 --> 00:28:33,672
I can't see.

346
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:42,014
Hey! Who put this rope here?
That could be dangerous.

347
00:28:43,307 --> 00:28:44,349
Whoopsie.

348
00:28:50,522 --> 00:28:52,441
We can make it.

349
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:56,153
But the others won't.

350
00:28:56,236 --> 00:28:58,906
When I call for it, lock up the brakes.

351
00:28:58,989 --> 00:29:02,326
What? No, we can win.

352
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,329
Brakes, now!

353
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:10,459
Good grief!

354
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:24,640
Victory!

355
00:29:28,227 --> 00:29:32,940
The trophy for first place
goes to Lucy and Sch--

356
00:29:33,023 --> 00:29:34,900
Thank you. I accept.

357
00:29:34,983 --> 00:29:38,278
And now for a little speech
that I have prepared.

358
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:53,210
I can't believe it. We were so close.

359
00:29:54,378 --> 00:29:56,296
After everything we've been through,

360
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:59,466
only to lose
because of a stupid snack cart.

361
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:01,885
What a tragedy.

362
00:30:03,345 --> 00:30:06,056
How can you just stand there?

363
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:08,058
Don't you have anything to say?

364
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:10,978
Didn't you even care
about winning the race?

365
00:30:11,061 --> 00:30:13,397
This race meant everything to me.

366
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,900
I thought if I could win, it would...

367
00:30:18,068 --> 00:30:19,528
It would what?

368
00:30:21,572 --> 00:30:25,409
Help me fit in,
help me make some friends in this town.

369
00:30:26,243 --> 00:30:29,329
I wanted to impress all of you
so I could become a part of the crew.

370
00:30:29,413 --> 00:30:32,583
Then why did you
throw it all away back there?

371
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:36,712
I couldn't let that happen to the others.

372
00:30:37,546 --> 00:30:39,756
Some things are more important
than winning.

373
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:44,761
I hope you're not disappointed
that you chose me to be your partner.

374
00:30:44,845 --> 00:30:46,680
Not one bit, Franklin.

375
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:52,436
Getting to know you has been
the best thing to happen to me all year.

376
00:30:53,937 --> 00:30:56,857
Sorry I never realized
how difficult it must be

377
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,151
having to make new friends all the time.

378
00:30:59,234 --> 00:31:00,694
It's tough.

379
00:31:00,777 --> 00:31:03,197
To not know what people
are going to think of you,

380
00:31:03,697 --> 00:31:06,491
to not know
if you're going to be able to fit in.

381
00:31:07,326 --> 00:31:10,954
I never get enough time
to really get to know anybody.

382
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:13,540
And nobody ever cares
about getting to know me.

383
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:18,545
I care, Franklin.
And I'm honored to call you my friend.

384
00:31:21,215 --> 00:31:22,925
Even though we may not have won,

385
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,636
it would have been nice
to at least finish.

386
00:31:31,642 --> 00:31:34,561
Some people are naturally born winners.

387
00:31:34,645 --> 00:31:37,231
Not to come off
like I'm bragging or anything...

388
00:31:37,314 --> 00:31:39,900
Did you see what Charlie Brown
and the new kid did?

389
00:31:40,484 --> 00:31:42,027
I hope they're okay.

390
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,779
Should we go check on them?

391
00:31:44,613 --> 00:31:46,281
Look, there they are.

392
00:31:46,365 --> 00:31:47,616
What?

393
00:31:57,376 --> 00:31:59,086
- Look at that.
- Wait a minute.

394
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:01,505
- What's going on?
- Where's everyone going?

395
00:32:01,588 --> 00:32:03,674
What are you all staring at?

396
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:05,300
I'm the winner.

397
00:32:11,014 --> 00:32:12,140
Oh, no.

398
00:32:15,686 --> 00:32:16,687
Don't give up.

399
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:19,231
You can make it.

400
00:32:24,695 --> 00:32:27,406
Are they cheering for us, Charlie Brown?

401
00:32:27,489 --> 00:32:28,699
- Come on!
- Don't give up!

402
00:32:28,782 --> 00:32:30,242
- Yay, Charlie Brown.
- Keep going!

403
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:31,577
- Go!
- Franklin!

404
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,245
I think they are, Franklin.

405
00:32:39,668 --> 00:32:41,587
You're almost there!

406
00:32:45,132 --> 00:32:46,800
Just a little further.

407
00:32:55,392 --> 00:32:56,810
You made it, Franklin.

408
00:32:57,394 --> 00:33:00,355
No, we made it, Charlie Brown.

409
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:03,817
It's like you said.
You don't need to win to finish first.

410
00:33:07,196 --> 00:33:10,365
- We all saw what you guys did back there.
- Yeah.

411
00:33:10,449 --> 00:33:12,201
It was Franklin's idea.

412
00:33:12,284 --> 00:33:13,744
If he hadn't done it,

413
00:33:13,827 --> 00:33:16,622
you would all be the ones
wearing ice cream right now.

414
00:33:17,247 --> 00:33:20,250
- Good job, Franklin.
- Great job, Charlie Brown.

415
00:33:20,334 --> 00:33:21,502
Hey, you!

416
00:33:22,711 --> 00:33:25,422
I just wanna tell you one thing.

417
00:33:26,507 --> 00:33:29,426
That was quite the gutsy maneuver
back there, Franklin.

418
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,595
You really saved the day.

419
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:34,932
Free pizza's on me tonight.

420
00:33:35,015 --> 00:33:36,767
I mean us.

421
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:44,191
I'll be right there.

422
00:33:44,274 --> 00:33:46,193
My parents wanna see me for a moment.

423
00:33:47,027 --> 00:33:48,153
I'll see you tonight.

424
00:33:49,071 --> 00:33:52,115
Did you see what my friend
Charlie Brown and I did?

425
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:21,895
Yeah, yeah, you got us there.

426
00:34:21,978 --> 00:34:23,063
But then we went wide,

427
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:25,607
and we cut you down
and passed you right back.

428
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:27,734
Only to set up for the next hairpin.

429
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:30,529
It was all part of our plan.

430
00:34:35,284 --> 00:34:38,620
Franklin, I'm so glad you made it.

431
00:34:38,704 --> 00:34:40,998
Hey, Charlie Brown. Sorry I'm late.

432
00:34:41,081 --> 00:34:43,833
My parents had something
very important to tell me.

433
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:47,129
My dad is taking a new job.
And that means...

434
00:34:47,212 --> 00:34:48,839
You're leaving.

435
00:34:50,632 --> 00:34:53,635
What? Leaving? Franklin?
Say it isn't so.

436
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:57,264
No, no. The job is here in town.

437
00:34:57,347 --> 00:34:59,933
We really like it here. We're staying.

438
00:35:09,443 --> 00:35:11,278
Have a slice, Franklin.

439
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:12,362
Thanks, Pigpen.

440
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:16,200
Coltrane. Good choice.

441
00:35:21,371 --> 00:35:24,708
Hey, Franklin. We're having a pickup game
at the ball field tomorrow.

442
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:27,044
- You wanna come?
- Count me in.

443
00:35:29,796 --> 00:35:32,049
This race with a partner
like Charlie Brown

444
00:35:32,132 --> 00:35:34,635
showed me a thing or two
about friendships.

445
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:36,053
They're not perfect.

446
00:35:36,553 --> 00:35:38,305
I'm not perfect.

447
00:35:38,889 --> 00:35:43,101
But we can get through the rough spots
together as friends.

448
00:35:43,852 --> 00:35:47,231
Hey, Franklin.
We saved you a seat over here.

449
00:35:47,898 --> 00:35:48,982
Come join us.

450
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:52,736
Ain't that what friendship's
really all about?

451
00:36:33,277 --> 00:36:36,905
It must feel great to not be living
out of that suitcase anymore.

452
00:36:37,906 --> 00:36:39,992
It sure does, Charlie Brown.

453
00:36:47,749 --> 00:36:52,254
"You know you've found your home
when you're surrounded by good friends."

454
00:36:52,337 --> 00:36:54,673
Did your grandfather always say that?

455
00:36:54,756 --> 00:36:57,509
No, that one is mine, Charlie Brown.

456
00:37:16,153 --> 00:37:19,031
Is everyone ready
for a fun day at the park?

457
00:37:19,615 --> 00:37:20,782
Hold on tight.

458
00:37:25,495 --> 00:37:27,873
Big brother!

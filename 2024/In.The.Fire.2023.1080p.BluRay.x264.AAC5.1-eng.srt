3
00:01:10,555 --> 00:01:15,169
The origin of the word
"psychology" is greek.

4
00:01:15,169 --> 00:01:18,824
It means science of the soul.

5
00:01:20,783 --> 00:01:25,919
A new form of medicine that seeks
to explain the phenomena of the mind,

6
00:01:27,703 --> 00:01:31,228
a much-misunderstood part
of the human body,

7
00:01:31,228 --> 00:01:35,015
which for some has greatly
compounded their suffering.

8
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:47,843
You can leave that right there.
Thank you.

9
00:03:47,843 --> 00:03:50,237
- Gracias.
- Thank you so much.

10
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,244
Excuse me?

11
00:03:57,244 --> 00:03:59,376
Excuse me!

12
00:03:59,376 --> 00:04:02,031
You're from the Marquez Ranch?

13
00:04:04,164 --> 00:04:08,645
Dear Isabella,
your son's case is intriguing.

14
00:04:08,645 --> 00:04:11,475
I'm eager to learn more.

15
00:04:11,475 --> 00:04:15,566
I believe the abnormalities
to be related to the mind, not
the body.

16
00:04:16,611 --> 00:04:18,917
I would like to come in person.

17
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:22,051
With proper time
and the latest in mental science,

18
00:04:22,051 --> 00:04:27,622
I am confident that we can come
to understand his peculiar intellect

19
00:04:27,622 --> 00:04:30,886
and integrate your son
back into society.

20
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,846
I look forward to meeting you.

21
00:04:34,846 --> 00:04:36,587
Grace.

22
00:05:13,363 --> 00:05:15,148
Maria!

23
00:05:24,853 --> 00:05:27,508
Doctor Grace Victoria Burnham.

24
00:05:27,508 --> 00:05:30,380
- Pleased to meet you.
- I am Maria.

25
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,426
- You are here to save us?
- Shh!

26
00:05:33,818 --> 00:05:36,169
How was your trip?

27
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,041
Very agreeable.
Thank you.

28
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:42,044
Come, I'll show you
to your room.

29
00:05:46,048 --> 00:05:50,879
I would like to see the boy
as soon as possible. Is he still
awake?

30
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:53,795
It is best to see the Don first.

31
00:05:55,362 --> 00:05:58,408
Temo will come with your things.

32
00:05:58,408 --> 00:06:01,368
Very good.
Shall I meet Isabella then?

33
00:06:01,368 --> 00:06:03,892
You should speak to
the Don first.

34
00:06:35,097 --> 00:06:39,406
Señor Marquez, it's a pleasure
to finally make your acquaintance.

35
00:06:40,494 --> 00:06:42,365
Señora...

36
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,938
I am Doctor Burnham.

37
00:06:49,938 --> 00:06:51,244
Hmm.

38
00:06:53,202 --> 00:06:55,117
I see.

39
00:06:57,728 --> 00:07:01,210
Temo will return you
to the station tomorrow.

40
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:04,213
- We have no need of a nurse.
- Excuse me?

41
00:07:04,213 --> 00:07:06,910
I'm sorry you came all this way.

42
00:07:08,217 --> 00:07:12,308
Come.

43
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,142
If there is a sick patient in
this home,
I will see to him.

44
00:07:21,361 --> 00:07:24,015
No matter how ignorant
his father is.

45
00:07:43,252 --> 00:07:45,863
You may see the boy tonight.

46
00:08:04,447 --> 00:08:07,015
I'm sorry for that.

47
00:08:07,015 --> 00:08:12,150
It's a bitter man who puts his prejudices
before the welfare of his own child.

48
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,720
- He has good reason.
- Is that so?

49
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,463
He doesn't seem
like a man moved by reason.

50
00:08:21,377 --> 00:08:24,598
I'm assuming
it was Isabella who taught the boy.

51
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:27,470
Martín taught himself.

52
00:08:34,172 --> 00:08:37,828
- You keep him like this?
- It is best.

53
00:08:55,716 --> 00:08:59,588
It's all right.
This is Doctor Burnham.

54
00:09:06,422 --> 00:09:09,686
Look, Martín.
She's from Nueva York.

55
00:09:10,687 --> 00:09:14,517
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Your music was lovely.

56
00:09:15,605 --> 00:09:18,216
Was that Paganini?

57
00:09:19,566 --> 00:09:21,785
May I sit?

58
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:26,268
Thank you, Martín.

59
00:09:31,447 --> 00:09:35,451
Father Antonio,
thank you, but you may leave us now.

60
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:38,454
I'm sorry, Señora, I must stay.

61
00:09:42,023 --> 00:09:44,199
Can you read to me?

62
00:09:55,123 --> 00:10:00,302
Yes. But first,
I'd like to ask you some questions.

63
00:10:00,302 --> 00:10:02,826
Would that be all right?

64
00:10:06,526 --> 00:10:11,226
- And do you like cowboys?
- They're called gauchos here or vaqueros.

65
00:10:11,226 --> 00:10:13,750
That's what I'm going to be.

66
00:10:16,579 --> 00:10:18,799
You are quite the enthusiast.

67
00:10:19,669 --> 00:10:22,803
You'd make Buffalo
Bill very proud.

68
00:10:24,935 --> 00:10:27,895
You've been as well to a show?

69
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:30,027
I have.

70
00:10:30,027 --> 00:10:33,030
During the World's
Fair in Chicago.

71
00:10:34,292 --> 00:10:36,381
You're very lucky.

72
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:41,648
Mama says Buffalo Bill
is almost a good cowboy as papá.

73
00:10:41,648 --> 00:10:43,519
I'm sure she's right.

74
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,391
Did she buy you all these books?

75
00:10:47,175 --> 00:10:49,482
Some.

76
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,615
But she won't buy
any more books for me.

77
00:10:52,615 --> 00:10:55,357
And why is that?

78
00:10:55,357 --> 00:10:57,925
Because I killed her.

79
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,333
Martín...

80
00:11:16,378 --> 00:11:18,641
Can you tell me what happened?

81
00:11:23,603 --> 00:11:25,561
Martín?

82
00:11:27,128 --> 00:11:29,260
Would you like me to
read to you now?

83
00:12:04,121 --> 00:12:06,559
Isabella, no!

84
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:12,521
Martín!

85
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,741
Martín!

86
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:21,399
Why have you allowed him
to perpetuate this idea that he
killed his mother?

87
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:22,966
Because that is what happened.

88
00:12:27,492 --> 00:12:29,843
He's always been like this.

89
00:12:29,843 --> 00:12:33,237
The very day Martín was born,
that's when the locusts came.

90
00:12:33,237 --> 00:12:35,457
It is like "Exodus 10".

91
00:12:35,457 --> 00:12:38,199
"The Lord sent a plague onto Egypt,
and that plague was death."

92
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:40,505
Father Antonio...

93
00:12:40,941 --> 00:12:44,945
before we begin Martín's
treatment,
let me be clear.

94
00:12:44,945 --> 00:12:48,862
We are dealing with a disorder.
A disease of the mind.

95
00:12:48,862 --> 00:12:51,865
Religion is not a factor.

96
00:12:51,865 --> 00:12:55,564
It is a matter of science
and we'll solve it as one.

97
00:12:57,566 --> 00:12:59,263
Sí, señora.

98
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:04,981
If we say we have no sin,

99
00:14:04,981 --> 00:14:10,552
we deceive ourselves,
and the truth is not in us.

100
00:14:10,552 --> 00:14:13,337
And who decides what is a sin?

101
00:14:13,337 --> 00:14:17,994
Martín, I would like to visit
your mother's grave.

102
00:14:18,821 --> 00:14:20,823
Would you mind taking me?

103
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:23,565
It's better if we stay
in the hacienda.

104
00:14:23,652 --> 00:14:26,263
No! She should see my mother.

105
00:14:28,526 --> 00:14:30,572
It's not safe.

106
00:14:32,356 --> 00:14:34,532
I will take you.

107
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,978
Do you miss your mother?

108
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:49,983
Shall we pray, Martín?

109
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:11,918
Father Antonio.

110
00:15:21,492 --> 00:15:23,277
Padre Gavira.

111
00:15:35,637 --> 00:15:38,248
- That is quite enough!
- Grace.

112
00:15:39,946 --> 00:15:41,904
You're scaring him.

113
00:15:54,395 --> 00:15:56,092
He is a child.

114
00:16:11,281 --> 00:16:12,892
Martín, no!

115
00:16:19,986 --> 00:16:23,816
- Martín, come! Come!

116
00:16:34,174 --> 00:16:36,393
Go, Grace!

117
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:41,834
We'll get the demon later!
We purify the Jesuit's soul.

118
00:17:06,075 --> 00:17:08,077
What have they done?

119
00:17:08,077 --> 00:17:11,124
Hold this. I need my bag.

120
00:17:13,691 --> 00:17:15,780
My bag. Now.

121
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:31,492
I need clean bandages.

122
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:46,072
What was that Temo said?
Satch-ak?

123
00:17:48,639 --> 00:17:53,862
Sach'aqa.
It's Quechua, it means
"savages".

124
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:04,612
Gavira came
when Martín was only months old.

125
00:18:05,178 --> 00:18:08,094
The Lord had spoken to him.

126
00:18:08,094 --> 00:18:14,317
He said we had to exorcise Martín
to get the devil out of him.

127
00:18:14,317 --> 00:18:16,624
I refused.

128
00:18:16,624 --> 00:18:20,802
And now they blame Martín
for everything bad that happens here.

129
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,024
You were right.

130
00:18:28,331 --> 00:18:30,855
They say Martín is evil.

131
00:18:33,728 --> 00:18:35,599
Maybe he is.

132
00:19:21,515 --> 00:19:25,171
- I was praying for you.
- Do you know who that is?

133
00:19:29,697 --> 00:19:33,179
- Satan.
- He was once God's favourite angel.

134
00:19:35,137 --> 00:19:38,532
But he wanted to be like God
so he was cast out of heaven.

135
00:19:40,838 --> 00:19:43,754
Satan hides in our world...

136
00:19:44,929 --> 00:19:47,236
until regains his strength.

137
00:19:47,758 --> 00:19:50,283
Then he will rise again
and wage his final war.

138
00:19:50,283 --> 00:19:54,417
Martín, would you warm
some water for me, please?

139
00:19:54,417 --> 00:19:56,941
Sí, señora.

140
00:19:56,941 --> 00:20:01,772
- Do you actually believe those
things?
- It's the word of God.

141
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:07,126
But I won't be
of much help in their great war,

142
00:20:09,606 --> 00:20:11,521
because I am weak.

143
00:20:11,521 --> 00:20:13,958
You don't have to tell me.

144
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:17,614
Gavira broke me with
just a few lashes.

145
00:20:17,614 --> 00:20:20,226
I confessed everything he asked.

146
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:26,623
"Is the boy in league with
Lucifer?"
"Yes."

147
00:20:26,623 --> 00:20:30,105
"Did he conspire
to bring famine to this valley?"
"Yes."

148
00:20:47,601 --> 00:20:49,298
Don Marquez!

149
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,868
This is no place for your son.

150
00:20:55,652 --> 00:20:57,872
I think you know that.

151
00:21:03,834 --> 00:21:05,532
Can you hear me?

152
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:10,624
He died this morning.
Half of my herd is already afflicted.

153
00:21:20,503 --> 00:21:22,679
Unquy llaqta utaq.

154
00:21:24,942 --> 00:21:29,947
The animals in the village
are sick as well. They will
blame Martín.

155
00:21:29,947 --> 00:21:33,429
Well, you must leave.
You've got to go to someplace safe.

156
00:21:33,429 --> 00:21:35,431
You can leave if you want.

157
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,590
That was very nice of you, Martín.

158
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,301
Señora.

159
00:23:03,998 --> 00:23:06,696
I see you are still here.
- I am.

160
00:23:08,307 --> 00:23:11,571
So you think you can still heal,
Martín?

161
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,095
Of course.

162
00:23:14,878 --> 00:23:16,489
Hmm.

163
00:23:23,757 --> 00:23:29,197
Let me tell you about Martíne's
sister.
She was stillborn.

164
00:23:30,807 --> 00:23:32,679
I'm sorry.

165
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:37,771
No, she wasn't...

166
00:23:58,313 --> 00:24:01,882
- !¡Nicolás! Déjame verla.
- I wanted her buried with the family.

167
00:24:01,882 --> 00:24:03,405
Nicolás!

168
00:24:03,405 --> 00:24:06,103
But Father Gavira
wouldn't allow it.

169
00:24:06,103 --> 00:24:11,370
She wasn't baptised,
so I buried her by the stream.

170
00:24:12,936 --> 00:24:16,070
- I see.
- No, you don't.

171
00:24:17,637 --> 00:24:21,554
Martín didn't like
the sound of his mother crying,

172
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,775
so he tried to make her stop.

173
00:24:41,791 --> 00:24:45,273
No! No!

174
00:24:45,273 --> 00:24:48,320
- No!
- Martín!

175
00:24:52,933 --> 00:24:55,109
Who would do
something like that?

176
00:24:58,721 --> 00:25:04,379
I believe that Martín has what
John Langdon Down called "savant
syndrome".

177
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:06,468
It's a disorder.

178
00:25:06,468 --> 00:25:10,037
It is modern medicine
that will help Martín.

179
00:25:10,037 --> 00:25:14,520
Not priests or myths
or delusions of omens.

180
00:25:23,964 --> 00:25:26,488
There is always an explanation.

181
00:26:55,882 --> 00:26:57,797
Father Gavira!

182
00:26:58,667 --> 00:27:01,104
I'm...

183
00:27:01,104 --> 00:27:03,150
I'm so sorry.

184
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:06,588
What happened?

185
00:27:06,588 --> 00:27:08,895
- You're arrogant to come here.
- I came to make peace.

186
00:27:10,287 --> 00:27:13,029
And to help you understand.

187
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:16,337
See, Martín isn't like
other children.

188
00:27:16,337 --> 00:27:18,818
He's got a sort of sickness.

189
00:27:19,775 --> 00:27:23,649
See, I am an alienist, a doctor.

190
00:27:23,649 --> 00:27:29,132
And I treat patients like Martín
who are alienated from their
human nature.

191
00:27:30,786 --> 00:27:33,876
I baptised
this boy when he was only days old.

192
00:27:33,876 --> 00:27:36,357
I look in his father's eyes,

193
00:27:36,357 --> 00:27:40,143
and I ask him to let me hold
this baby's head under the water.

194
00:27:40,143 --> 00:27:43,799
- He trust me, and I failed him.
- No.

195
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:47,673
The Lord sent me
a warning when Martín was born.

196
00:27:49,109 --> 00:27:53,809
- I didn't listen.
- Martín is different. But he's
no demon.

197
00:27:53,809 --> 00:27:56,333
Satan disguised
himself as an angel.

198
00:27:57,117 --> 00:28:01,513
Martín has a condition,
an illness.

199
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:05,821
Look, if you just see right here,
you will understand.

200
00:28:05,821 --> 00:28:08,650
It is all right here. Look.

201
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,131
See?

202
00:28:11,131 --> 00:28:14,482
Please. You'll see.

203
00:28:17,616 --> 00:28:21,620
Our book also
has a name for this condition.

204
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,404
El Maligno.

205
00:28:25,624 --> 00:28:27,843
I'm no child you can scare.

206
00:28:28,278 --> 00:28:32,108
No fue Adán
quien fue engañado, sino una
mujer llamada Eva.

207
00:28:32,108 --> 00:28:34,110
Amen!

208
00:28:44,077 --> 00:28:49,169
- !¡Malditos! !Bruja!
- Get off of me! Let me go! Let
me go!

209
00:28:49,169 --> 00:28:53,347
- Let me go!
- !¡Bruja!

210
00:28:53,347 --> 00:28:56,263
Get off of me! Get off of me!

211
00:28:56,263 --> 00:28:58,874
- Let me go!

212
00:28:58,874 --> 00:29:04,358
Get off of me!

213
00:29:12,105 --> 00:29:14,498
You will confess?

214
00:29:17,719 --> 00:29:19,852
I do this to save you.

215
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:24,987
Bastard.

216
00:29:24,987 --> 00:29:27,120
You bastards!

217
00:29:31,646 --> 00:29:33,256
Andrés.

218
00:32:29,824 --> 00:32:31,565
Fourteen.

219
00:32:33,349 --> 00:32:35,699
Fourteen qué?

220
00:32:36,744 --> 00:32:41,705
You'll have to slaughter
fourteen head.
Better do it now before they starve.

221
00:33:28,752 --> 00:33:32,278
There is no right or wrong answer.
All right?

222
00:33:33,409 --> 00:33:35,629
What do you see?

223
00:33:39,111 --> 00:33:42,331
- There is nothing.
- Really?

224
00:33:43,028 --> 00:33:47,902
This inkblot was made by
Justinus Kerner,
a German physician.

225
00:33:47,902 --> 00:33:49,991
Like you.

226
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:55,867
He was also a poet,
inspired by this very picture.

227
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,043
So, tell me, Martín...

228
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,047
do you still see nothing?

229
00:34:02,961 --> 00:34:05,180
That's not a shape.

230
00:34:10,011 --> 00:34:15,582
I see a lake in the mountains
because it reminds me of home.

231
00:34:17,758 --> 00:34:20,239
Does it remind you of anything?

232
00:34:21,327 --> 00:34:23,677
Anything at all.

233
00:34:45,524 --> 00:34:47,395
Perhaps I see a butterfly.

234
00:34:50,182 --> 00:34:51,923
Very well.

235
00:34:56,144 --> 00:34:58,232
How about this one?

236
00:34:59,799 --> 00:35:02,585
What do you see?

237
00:35:02,585 --> 00:35:04,979
I see a moth.

238
00:35:17,252 --> 00:35:21,561
- Everything all right, Father?
- I can't
remember the last time I've seen rain.

239
00:35:27,045 --> 00:35:30,004
You really seem
to have made a connection.

240
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:32,572
If I may...

241
00:35:33,399 --> 00:35:35,662
what do you see in him?

242
00:35:39,057 --> 00:35:42,974
I see a boy born with
special abilities.

243
00:35:44,323 --> 00:35:48,109
Music, mathematics, language.

244
00:35:48,109 --> 00:35:54,594
A boy born with the ability to
access parts
of the brain that others don't
even know exist.

245
00:35:55,421 --> 00:35:57,640
A boy touched by God.

246
00:35:59,033 --> 00:36:01,427
That's one way to say it.

247
00:36:04,517 --> 00:36:06,693
What else?

248
00:36:10,827 --> 00:36:14,222
I see a... confused,

249
00:36:15,049 --> 00:36:17,747
lost child

250
00:36:17,747 --> 00:36:19,967
with no place in this world,

251
00:36:21,142 --> 00:36:24,798
born incapable of normal
social behaviour.

252
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,106
Incapable of empathy.

253
00:36:31,065 --> 00:36:33,285
And do you believe you
can cure him?

254
00:36:36,853 --> 00:36:38,594
No.

255
00:36:40,901 --> 00:36:46,994
But I can help Martín
imagine what it's like to feel

256
00:36:46,994 --> 00:36:49,170
what other people are feeling.

257
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,782
I believe that only God can
change, Martín.

258
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:04,403
But who knows, Grace?

259
00:37:05,708 --> 00:37:08,407
Perhaps he works through you.

260
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:42,658
Not yet.

261
00:37:47,663 --> 00:37:49,448
Thank you.

262
00:37:53,626 --> 00:37:56,063
I didn't know you were
waiting for me.

263
00:37:56,063 --> 00:38:00,415
It would be nice to eat together,
as a family would.

264
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:06,204
!¡Claro!
It's nice to have a woman at our
table again.

265
00:38:06,204 --> 00:38:09,685
- Thank you, Don Marquez.
- Nicolás, please.

266
00:38:11,252 --> 00:38:14,255
The east field is ready
to be replanted.

267
00:38:15,735 --> 00:38:17,737
Wheat will grow there now.

268
00:38:24,744 --> 00:38:29,618
"The dusty cowboy rode
into town astride his giant
black steed."

269
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,668
"Outnumbered and surrounded,
he faced down the cattle
rustlers."

270
00:38:35,668 --> 00:38:40,020
"His wife, still in the grips
of these bandits, called out,

271
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:44,590
'William, run! Save yourself!'."

272
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:48,420
"But Bill Cody would do
no such thing."

273
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:53,686
"He drew his two Colt revolvers
and galloped into the bandits."

274
00:38:53,686 --> 00:39:00,867
"And when the dust settled,
there was only one man still set
atop his horse."

275
00:39:00,867 --> 00:39:05,480
"The West's most wild cowboy,
a true gaucho."

276
00:39:06,481 --> 00:39:09,789
- Like my father.
- Like your father.

277
00:39:10,703 --> 00:39:12,661
Now it's bedtime.

278
00:39:15,621 --> 00:39:17,188
Good night.

279
00:39:46,739 --> 00:39:49,394
You know this is
just loneliness.

280
00:39:50,873 --> 00:39:53,528
You know that, right?

281
00:39:53,528 --> 00:39:55,661
Maybe.

282
00:41:42,942 --> 00:41:44,944
You keep the boy inside.

283
00:41:46,815 --> 00:41:50,863
No, that's wrong.
He's supposed to say the
benediction next.

284
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:55,955
Fear not, for I have redeemed you.
I have called you by name, you
are mine.

285
00:41:55,955 --> 00:41:58,044
- You are mine, you are mine.
- Martín. Martín.

286
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:27,378
Martín, I need you...

287
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:03,675
So, Martín, I need to go help.

288
00:43:03,675 --> 00:43:08,375
Will you stay here for me?
Please? All right?

289
00:43:27,481 --> 00:43:31,572
- Nicolás! Where's Nicolás?
- He went inside.

290
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:38,187
Nicolás!

291
00:43:38,187 --> 00:43:39,928
No!

292
00:43:39,928 --> 00:43:42,801
Nicolás! Nicolás!

293
00:43:43,671 --> 00:43:46,718
Nicolás! Nicolás!

294
00:44:09,001 --> 00:44:10,568
No!

295
00:45:13,761 --> 00:45:15,981
Martín. Martín.

296
00:45:17,112 --> 00:45:19,593
Get up now, and
follow me outside.

297
00:45:19,724 --> 00:45:21,639
Hurry!

298
00:45:24,642 --> 00:45:26,339
Temo!

299
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,777
Antonio!

300
00:45:35,217 --> 00:45:37,132
Stay here.

301
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,278
Go! Go!

302
00:46:50,379 --> 00:46:52,468
Nicolás...

303
00:46:57,212 --> 00:46:59,040
Martín...

304
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:03,523
The fire, he...

305
00:47:07,832 --> 00:47:12,314
Yesterday, in the field,
Martín took my hand.

306
00:47:25,458 --> 00:47:27,590
You'll need stitches.

307
00:47:29,854 --> 00:47:31,856
Later.

308
00:49:09,867 --> 00:49:11,825
I saw something.

309
00:49:13,914 --> 00:49:16,264
During the fire.

310
00:49:18,397 --> 00:49:22,967
Something... impossible.

311
00:49:28,537 --> 00:49:30,104
If I...

312
00:49:31,192 --> 00:49:33,412
If my reason...

313
00:49:36,197 --> 00:49:43,030
If I of all people
can't see Martín without prejudice,

314
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:49,080
then how am I to help him?

315
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:55,086
God works through us.
It is by his hand you came here.

316
00:49:57,436 --> 00:49:59,699
God didn't send me, Father.

317
00:50:01,788 --> 00:50:06,662
If he exists,
God abandoned us a long time ago.

318
00:50:16,803 --> 00:50:19,197
Do you know what "grace" means?

319
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:26,813
Grace is when... God reaches out
to us
in moments when we want nothing
to do with him.

320
00:50:26,813 --> 00:50:31,252
When he puts his faith in us,
even when we've lost it in ourselves.

321
00:50:33,385 --> 00:50:35,213
What I'm trying to say

322
00:50:35,213 --> 00:50:40,348
is that perhaps it is you
we needed here in this hour of darkness.

323
00:50:40,348 --> 00:50:44,744
Not in spite of your beliefs,
but because of them.

324
00:50:56,974 --> 00:51:00,891
Good morning.
Good morning.

325
00:51:05,112 --> 00:51:06,592
Martín...

326
00:51:07,506 --> 00:51:09,595
Look at me.

327
00:51:11,379 --> 00:51:16,341
Martín, it's time for
our morning talk.

328
00:51:20,171 --> 00:51:23,957
Papá should plant amaranth
in the east field.

329
00:51:23,957 --> 00:51:25,872
Is that so?

330
00:51:25,872 --> 00:51:30,355
Amaranth is more tolerant
to blight and drought. We had
both this year.

331
00:51:31,878 --> 00:51:35,142
All right. We'll tell
him tonight.

332
00:51:36,056 --> 00:51:38,711
We should tell
the other farmers in the
village, too.

333
00:51:38,711 --> 00:51:41,235
And why would you
like to do that?

334
00:51:42,889 --> 00:51:45,674
So they don't burn
our house down.

335
00:51:45,674 --> 00:51:47,807
Only that?

336
00:51:48,764 --> 00:51:53,769
Or could it be that you also
don't
want them to go hungry? - No,
only that.

337
00:51:56,859 --> 00:52:01,168
Why do you think that they burned
down your stables? - To punish me.

338
00:52:02,387 --> 00:52:04,345
- Why?
- Because I killed their crops.

339
00:52:05,825 --> 00:52:09,655
Martín, did you kill
their crops?

340
00:52:09,655 --> 00:52:13,615
Did you sneak out in the middle
of the night and release the
locusts?

341
00:52:13,615 --> 00:52:15,922
Maybe.

342
00:52:15,922 --> 00:52:21,493
And did you also cast a spell
on their animals and make them
sick and die?

343
00:52:21,493 --> 00:52:24,365
- Martín, did you?
- No.

344
00:52:24,365 --> 00:52:28,630
- Well, then it can't be true,
can it?
- What about the man last night?

345
00:52:29,805 --> 00:52:35,289
Hey, Martín, you did
nothing to him.

346
00:52:35,289 --> 00:52:38,336
You didn't do anything.

347
00:52:38,336 --> 00:52:40,512
Do you hear me?

348
00:52:40,512 --> 00:52:43,297
He started a fire and
it killed him.

349
00:52:46,344 --> 00:52:48,911
That's what happened.

350
00:52:48,911 --> 00:52:54,047
Martín,
those people are scared, all
right?

351
00:52:54,047 --> 00:52:56,310
They're scared, and they
need something to blame for that fear,

352
00:52:56,310 --> 00:53:01,054
and it's going to be you,
because you are different.

353
00:53:01,054 --> 00:53:03,056
All right?

354
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:05,928
Do you understand me?

355
00:53:08,801 --> 00:53:10,629
Yes.

356
00:53:45,577 --> 00:53:47,709
How's Martín?

357
00:53:49,755 --> 00:53:52,062
He understands what happened.

358
00:53:53,628 --> 00:53:55,761
He blames himself.

359
00:53:57,676 --> 00:53:59,678
What can I do?

360
00:54:00,983 --> 00:54:03,029
Treat him like a son.

361
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:07,207
Love him...

362
00:54:08,121 --> 00:54:09,862
without judgement.

363
00:54:11,907 --> 00:54:15,302
He mentioned planting amaranth.
Perhaps you could take him back
with you.

364
00:54:15,302 --> 00:54:17,304
No.

365
00:54:17,304 --> 00:54:21,526
But he needs that. He needs
to spend time with you, working
in the fields.

366
00:54:21,526 --> 00:54:23,919
He will work with me.

367
00:54:26,792 --> 00:54:29,490
But we cannot plant
together again.

368
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:36,497
They've sown my land with salt.
Nothing will grow now.

369
00:54:50,032 --> 00:54:52,818
In the case of common hysteria,

370
00:54:53,819 --> 00:54:58,954
it not infrequently happens
that instead of a single major trauma,

371
00:54:59,825 --> 00:55:06,701
we find a number of partial traumas,
forming a group of provoking causes.

372
00:55:07,876 --> 00:55:13,882
They are components
of a single story of suffering.

373
00:55:21,281 --> 00:55:25,851
We must presume,
then, that the cyclical trauma,

374
00:55:25,851 --> 00:55:30,029
or, more precisely,
the memory of that trauma,

375
00:55:31,073 --> 00:55:34,381
acts as a foreign body

376
00:55:35,991 --> 00:55:37,471
which...

377
00:55:38,994 --> 00:55:45,523
long after its entry must continue
to be regarded as an agent still
at work,

378
00:55:46,393 --> 00:55:50,397
only disappearing once the memory
has been vividly provoked.

379
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:55,663
The process must be
brought back to its "status
nascendi",

380
00:55:56,882 --> 00:55:59,711
its state of birth.

381
00:56:08,981 --> 00:56:11,026
Can you hear it, Martín?

382
00:56:12,593 --> 00:56:18,643
Each click in rhythm
like the one before and the one after.

383
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:27,217
Each moment no longer
and no shorter than any other.

384
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,917
Time passing in
perfect symmetry.

385
00:56:36,138 --> 00:56:40,404
I'm going to name a thing, and
you're going
to tell me how it makes you feel.

386
00:56:41,666 --> 00:56:45,626
- Horses.
- I like to ride horses.

387
00:56:45,626 --> 00:56:47,759
But they smell very bad.

388
00:56:49,935 --> 00:56:53,330
- Yellow clovers.
- I hate them.

389
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:57,159
- Why?
- Because they remind me of Mama.

390
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,119
Tell me about her.

391
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:10,260
She smelled like lavender
and her hair was the colour of
burnt coffee.

392
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:14,612
- How did she make you feel?
- Safe.

393
00:57:16,918 --> 00:57:19,660
That sounds very nice.

394
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:23,055
Why would you dislike
that feeling, Martín?

395
00:57:23,055 --> 00:57:26,841
Because it's a lie.
We're not safe.

396
00:57:26,841 --> 00:57:28,843
We're all going to die
because of me.

397
00:57:34,109 --> 00:57:36,677
- What is your lie?
- What?

398
00:57:40,725 --> 00:57:42,857
What is your lie?

399
00:57:46,557 --> 00:57:51,997
What-is-your-lie?

400
00:57:53,215 --> 00:57:59,439
What is your lie?

401
00:58:04,444 --> 00:58:06,620
That I'm a fraud.

402
00:58:08,056 --> 00:58:13,801
That I repeat the teachings
of great men, but I'm not one of them.

403
00:58:19,111 --> 00:58:24,246
That I'll travel to the edge
of the world to prove myself,
only to fail.

404
00:58:44,789 --> 00:58:46,747
Those aren't lies.

405
00:58:52,274 --> 00:58:54,842
They're fears.

406
00:59:13,426 --> 00:59:16,386
- Temo?
- Uma wakcha kunan.

407
00:59:16,516 --> 00:59:18,475
What is it?

408
01:00:31,809 --> 01:00:33,898
I believe it to be typhus.

409
01:00:34,942 --> 01:00:38,293
- Plague.
- It's spread by lice.

410
01:00:38,293 --> 01:00:42,428
I need you to go inside and burn everything
that she could have touched in
the last few days.

411
01:00:42,428 --> 01:00:46,954
Linens, blankets, clothing...
Anything that could spread the disease.

412
01:00:46,954 --> 01:00:49,130
Do you understand?

413
01:01:59,331 --> 01:02:05,598
Through this Holy Unction of oil
and through the great goodness
of his mercy...

414
01:02:41,895 --> 01:02:43,593
Nicolás!

415
01:02:44,463 --> 01:02:46,813
I can't... do this.

416
01:02:52,732 --> 01:02:55,996
I'm not who you think I am.

417
01:02:56,910 --> 01:02:58,172
No.

418
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,219
No.

419
01:03:02,307 --> 01:03:08,966
I'm a fraud. - For the first time,
I know my son and he knows me.

420
01:03:10,228 --> 01:03:15,450
This...
This is just science, a disease.

421
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:19,324
But what you have done
with my son is a miracle.

422
01:03:21,848 --> 01:03:22,893
She's gone.

423
01:03:26,592 --> 01:03:28,507
It's God's will.

424
01:03:38,299 --> 01:03:43,696
...committed
by evil use of sight, hearing,

425
01:03:43,696 --> 01:03:47,178
smell, taste and speech, touch,

426
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:50,660
ability to walk.

427
01:03:52,966 --> 01:03:54,664
Amen.

428
01:05:45,296 --> 01:05:50,170
- Which books would you like me
to pack?
- We won't have room.

429
01:05:55,610 --> 01:05:59,136
The violin, then. We
must bring this.

430
01:06:03,270 --> 01:06:05,446
I'm sorry.

431
01:06:05,446 --> 01:06:07,884
- I'm sorry.
- What?

432
01:06:07,884 --> 01:06:10,234
I'm sorry.

433
01:06:10,234 --> 01:06:12,279
I didn't mean to hurt Maria.

434
01:06:15,848 --> 01:06:19,721
I don't want to leave.
I'll be better, I promise.

435
01:06:19,721 --> 01:06:23,421
Please. I'll think whatever
you want me to think. I just
want to stay!

436
01:06:29,731 --> 01:06:33,431
Martín, look at me.

437
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:47,445
I can only imagine
how confusing this must be for you.

438
01:06:50,535 --> 01:06:53,190
This is not your fault.

439
01:06:56,323 --> 01:06:59,761
None of this is your fault.

440
01:07:03,243 --> 01:07:04,984
None of it.

441
01:07:07,465 --> 01:07:09,293
Now come help me pack.

442
01:07:41,542 --> 01:07:43,805
- Padre.
- I'm ready.

443
01:07:49,333 --> 01:07:51,335
Your things?

444
01:07:52,466 --> 01:07:54,512
I have all that I need.

445
01:07:56,079 --> 01:07:58,081
Very good.

446
01:08:03,042 --> 01:08:08,395
- They're coming for him.
- Martín, come inside. Come.

447
01:08:11,877 --> 01:08:14,184
If the worst should happen.

448
01:08:15,707 --> 01:08:17,274
No.

449
01:08:19,537 --> 01:08:21,800
They would be cruel.

450
01:08:57,879 --> 01:08:59,794
You know what? Martín...

451
01:09:01,535 --> 01:09:04,625
Why don't you play some music
for me?
I think that would...

452
01:09:05,496 --> 01:09:08,978
- That would make me feel better.
- Sí, señora.

453
01:09:54,414 --> 01:09:56,068
Martín!

454
01:10:05,643 --> 01:10:07,775
Martín...

455
01:10:09,342 --> 01:10:10,996
Let's go.

456
01:10:16,175 --> 01:10:18,177
Let's get him to the horses.

457
01:10:23,835 --> 01:10:25,271
Come!

458
01:10:38,110 --> 01:10:39,764
Come!

459
01:10:41,896 --> 01:10:45,509
These take you to the
cold cellar. Here.

460
01:10:49,817 --> 01:10:51,819
Antonio!

461
01:10:53,125 --> 01:10:55,258
Good luck, Doctor.

462
01:12:34,487 --> 01:12:36,533
Nicolás?

463
01:12:47,326 --> 01:12:49,023
Temo!

464
01:12:58,032 --> 01:13:01,166
- Mátalo!
- Sach'aqa.

465
01:13:02,341 --> 01:13:04,429
Yes.

466
01:13:10,696 --> 01:13:12,699
Sach'aqa.

467
01:13:19,576 --> 01:13:21,230
Martín.

468
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:43,556
Get behind me, Martín!

469
01:13:43,556 --> 01:13:45,384
Mátalo!

470
01:13:51,259 --> 01:13:53,610
Martín! No!

471
01:14:42,746 --> 01:14:44,878
Amen!

472
01:15:22,307 --> 01:15:24,048
!¡Papá!

473
01:15:31,272 --> 01:15:35,146
Mátalo! Mátalo! Mátalo!

474
01:15:35,146 --> 01:15:36,973
!¡Papá!

475
01:15:38,454 --> 01:15:40,369
!¡Papá!

476
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:45,809
Mátalo! Mátalo! Mátalo!

477
01:15:45,809 --> 01:15:47,985
!¡Papá!

478
01:15:49,203 --> 01:15:51,509
!¡Papá!

479
01:16:05,568 --> 01:16:07,526
!¡La mato yo, la bruja!

480
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:27,589
Martín!

481
01:16:43,083 --> 01:16:44,781
!¡Papá!

482
01:16:50,089 --> 01:16:51,962
!¡Papá!

483
01:16:52,789 --> 01:16:54,443
!¡Papá!

484
01:18:13,870 --> 01:18:15,348
Nicolás...

485
01:18:20,485 --> 01:18:22,487
People...

486
01:18:24,445 --> 01:18:26,709
They won't understand.

487
01:18:31,627 --> 01:18:33,846
I killed those men.

488
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:41,071
That's not what I saw.

489
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:46,990
I killed them. That's
what you saw.

490
01:18:47,860 --> 01:18:49,906
Nothing else.

491
01:18:57,652 --> 01:19:00,177
What will become of him?

492
01:19:03,136 --> 01:19:05,268
I will protect him.

493
01:19:14,757 --> 01:19:16,714
He will be safe...

494
01:19:19,762 --> 01:19:21,764
and happy.

495
01:19:53,534 --> 01:19:55,406
Martín...

496
01:20:00,366 --> 01:20:02,804
It's time we take our trip.

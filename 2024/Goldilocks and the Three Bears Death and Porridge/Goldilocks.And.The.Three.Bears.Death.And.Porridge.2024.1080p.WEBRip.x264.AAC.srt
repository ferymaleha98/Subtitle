3
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,720
It's time
for breakfast!

4
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,320
You all right?

5
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,440
Ohh... yeah, I just had
a really messed-up dream

6
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,400
about one of my
favourite kids' stories.

7
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,560
- Which one?
- It doesn't matter.

8
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,320
Don't worry, I don't know

9
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,120
a single nightmare
that became a reality.

10
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,720
How long 'til we get there?
We've been driving for hours.

11
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,960
Hey, Jas, how's
your twin brother, Nav?

12
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,400
He's good, thanks.

13
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,600
He's got exams right now,
so he couldn't join us today.

14
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,280
By the way, you said
Simon was coming.

15
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,520
How's he getting here?

16
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,880
Oh, shit! Turn right!

17
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,040
What are teenagers doing here
in the middle of the woods?

18
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,840
Hey, guys,
I think we're almost there.

19
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,480

00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,720

00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,720
- I'm well.
- Good.

31
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,200
You told me this place
was in the middle of nowhere.

32
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,160
Yet I ran into a bunch
of annoying, annoying teenagers.

33
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,200
- Really?
- Yeah.

34
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,480
- That's strange.
- Anyway.

35
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,800
Kelly!

36
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,000
- Good to see you, Simon!
- Likewise.

37
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,880
Aww, come here!

38
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,920
Who's Bilbo Baggins?

39
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,840
- I'm George.
- Nice to meet you. How are you?

40
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,320
- Simon!
- Good to see you, man.

41
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,240
- How you doing, brother?
- Not bad.

42
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,360
- Looking real as always!
- I'm trying.

43
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,880
How was Ukraine?

44
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,560
Er, I wanted to stay longer.

45
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,320
I was helping the refugees.

46
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,960
- A very difficult situation.
- Mm-hmm.

47
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,760
Your Sikh friends were helping.
Very good people.

48
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,360
Wish I had stayed longer, but
I had to take care of family.

49
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,800
Talking of family,
how's your twin brother, Nav?

50
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,160
- He's okay now.
- Good to hear.

51
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,480
- How long you been waiting?
- Only about 45 minutes.

52
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,720
There's no key under the mat.

53
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,880
There has to be an explanation.
Do you have the owner's number?

54
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,280
Yeah, I'll give them a call.

55
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,280
It's just voicemail.

56
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,760
Hi, we're at the location,

57
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,640
but there's no key
under the mat.

58
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,480
If you could give us
a call back, please.

59
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,600
Hello?

60
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,120
Well, how is that possible?

61
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,000
They're saying they sent us
to the wrong location.

62
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,600
Are you kidding me?

63
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,840
It's gonna be dark soon.
You guys travelled miles.

64
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,920
Did you see
any accommodations on the way?

65
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,120
No, there was nothing
around for miles.

66
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,640
No, I got no Wi-fi.

67
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,520
I could give them another call,
see what they say.

68
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,600
Oh, really?
That worked out well, didn't it?

69
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,560
What are we gonna do now?

70
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,120
Okay, it's only one night.
Let's look around the house.

71
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,600
Possibly we can find a way in.

72
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,680
- That's just fantastic.
- Let's go.

73
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,360
I need the loo anyways.
And some caffeine and some food.

74
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,640
Guys, where are you going?

75
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,080
Hello?

76
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,360
Hello? Is anybody...?

77
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,080
Hello? Is anybody here?

78
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,480
Is this a good idea?

79
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,360
I don't think they would
want us to go hungry.

80
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,800
- Hello?
- Okay.

81
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,440
Anybody in?

82
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,120
Hey, so...

83
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,480
I know it's...
I know it's not ideal,

84
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,400
but, yeah,
this door's breakable.

85
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,320
Can I have a look?

86
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,920
Okay,
let's just do this.

87
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,040
Let's give it a good barge.

88
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,600
All right. One, two, three.

89
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,960
Let's not think about this.
Just do it.

90
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,040
Yeah, let's do this.

91
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,200
Okay. One, two...

92
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,480
We're in.

93
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,640
Yeah.

94
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,440
I'm gonna have a look around.

95
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,760
What are you waiting for?
Come in.

96
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,160
Ooh! Nice house!

97
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,920
It is. But I don't feel
right about it.

98
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,640
I'm gonna find
the Wi-fi password.

99
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,440
Then let's eat.

100
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,040
It's the kitchen for me.

101
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,720
Let me go find the bathroom.

102
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,040
Why do they make beds
so soft these days?

103
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,360
Although I have
no reason to complain.

104
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,280
There's something
not right about this place.

105
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,440
Four bowls?

106
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,960
Four of everything.

107
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,520
What?

108
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,920
No food? Are you kidding me?

109
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,720
Surely there's got to be Wi-fi.

110
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,360
Hmm...

111
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,480
There's no bloody food
except porridge.

112
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,960
- At least we've got breakfast.
- So, I found a house phone.

113
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,680
But it's disconnected.

114
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,760
Okay, this is
certainly strange, but...

115
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,680
It's only one night.
Let's make the best of it.

116
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,320
George, any luck on the Wi-fi?

117
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,960
Nope.

118
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,200
- My bad.
- Like Simon said...

119
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,800
It's only one night.

120
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,040
Okay, I've got
a good suggestion

121
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,320
that will be good.

122
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,480
We've got food in the car,
let's make it easy.

123
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,200
Cook something up.

124
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,560
Ooh! Sorry!

125
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,560
Are you trying
to make me more nervous?

126
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,120
- Are you okay?
- It's okay.

127
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,560
I think I'm just a bit
pissed off about the house.

128
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,720
That's okay.
Try not to think about it.

129
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,920
We'll get it fixed. At least
we've got somewhere to stay.

130
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,800
That's true.
Are you not running the bath?

131
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,720
Yeah, I'm just
running the water.

132
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,080
Oh, okay. I think
I might have one tonight.

133
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,240
That's a good idea.
Let's just make the most of it.

134
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,360
Besides...

135
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,760
Place
has no fucking Internet!

136
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,840
Let's just make
the most of it.

137
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,200
You know?

138
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,600
Did George Baggins
find any Internet?

139
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,880
- Oh, don't ask.
- Huh.

140
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,920
You know, on the plus side,
I did remember the wine.

141
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,720
Oh my gosh, that's awesome!

142
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,680
Ooh, good,
did you bring the chocolates?

143
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,360
Like I said, it could be worse.

144
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,080
Oxford suit,
best in the business.

145
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,680
Excuse me!

146
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,280
What's the deal with the people
who own this place?

147
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,320
There's no wine glasses,
no proper kitchenware.

148
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,520
There's just fucking plastic.

149
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,400
I've gotta agree.

150
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,960
It's kind of strange.
Maybe they're selling the place?

151
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,880
Or maybe long-term rental?

152
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Or maybe they've gone abroad.

153
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,560
Mm, that would explain
the no Wi-fi.

154
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,440
I think it's good
we're all catching up

155
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,680
after a few
stressful weeks at work

156
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,880
and everything that's gone on.

157
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,360
Wait... "Everything
that's gone on"?

158
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,240
Well, I invested
in the stock market,

159
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,160
and I suppose
you could say I lost my ass.

160
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,280
Look, you're smart enough
to bounce back.

161
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,440
You still have
your house, right?

162
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,360
Well, I mean, these help.

163
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,360
Although sometimes
they do make you see things.

164
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,720
Come on, darling.
You know you don't need those.

165
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
You can always come to me.
You know that.

166
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,360
I know.

167
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,600
You know, we all make
mistakes in life.

168
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,440
Some more than others.

169
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,320
But it's about how we
bounce back that matters most.

170
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,800
We know you will.

171
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,960
That's true.

172
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,800
You know, I love you guys.

173
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,160
If I lost any money,
I'd fucking blow my head off.

174
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,160
You always make
me laugh, George.

175
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,480
Any time.

176
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,960
Look on the bright side.
There's a lot worse

177
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,880
going on in the world today.

178
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,280
Yeah, like,
If I don't get a pizza soon,

179
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,360
I'm gonna be the one
eating those pills.

180
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,840
Let's get pizza tomorrow night.

181
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,760
Ah! I thought
you only eat salads, Kelly.

182
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,040
Er, excuse me, am I
the only one drinking here?

183
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,920
Oh, shit, yeah.

184
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,600
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

185
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,960
Thank you.

186
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,680
Guys, are you still doing
those kiddie pranks?

187
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,400
- Of course.
- Oh my God.

188
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,000
Don't tell me
you still do the crap with,

189
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,560
"We have to wear
the same clothes

190
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,040
every time we go away."

191
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,720
We do.

192
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,880
I'm waiting for you to tell me
we didn't actually break in,

193
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,280
and you actually know
who lives here,

194
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,200
and we do actually have Wi-fi

195
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,720
and actual food in a fridge.

196
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,160
Oh, come on!

197
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,440
I suggest we pay the damages

198
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,560
and not have the shenanigans
we had this time.

199
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,160
I'll drink to that.

200
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,000
Although we do have
to be up early in the morning.

201
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,440
Bed now? For everyone?

202
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,200
I gotta go check on the car.

203
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,960
Yep. Coming.

204
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,960
- You okay?
- Yeah, mm-hmm.

205
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,840
Nicole.

206
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,480
Nicole.

207
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,800
Shit.

208
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,960
Happy birthday!

209
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,840
Guys, you could've given me
a bloody heart attack.

210
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,120
I think somebody deserves this.

211
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,240
Yes, I do need this.

212
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,920
Happy birthday.

213
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,640
Oh, George!

214
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,720
Here you go.
We got you something.

215
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,720
You shouldn't have.

216
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,640
Oh, you guys!

217
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,360
It's being delivered
to your apartment.

218
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,600
You're bloody fantastic

219
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,960
when you're not scaring
the crap out of me.

220
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,440
Thank you so much.

221
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,080
It's okay, just try
not to have too many nightmares.

222
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,640
- I'll try not to.
- Appreciate it.

223
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,960
Thank you.

224
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,520
I'm gonna crash. I gotta prepare

225
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,240
for a full day tomorrow
without Internet.

226
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,480
You can't keep off
social media, can you?

227
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,680
I'm so glad
I was a kid in the '80s.

228
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,280
Good night.
Sleep well if you can.

229
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,280
I will do after that jump scare.

230
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,120
I think you deserve
a little bit more.

231
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,440
Oh.

232
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,480
I do hope you're going to help
me finish this bottle of wine.

233
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,360
I kinda quit
alcohol last summer.

234
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,200
Oh. Why is that?

235
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,680
I'll tell you another time.

236
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,320
Gosh, you're so mysterious!

237
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,760
- Why?
- I am?

238
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,400
Mmm, very much so.

239
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,440
- I hope in a good way.
- Yes.

240
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,680
Quite so. Yeah,
you know, all night,

241
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,320
I've been wanting to kiss you.

242
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,080
Come on, the wine's talking now.

243
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,400
No, no, no it's not.

244
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,480
So your birthday has been
quite interesting, hasn't it?

245
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,760
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

246
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,960
Come on, have
a little bit more wine.

247
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,120
- You can drink.
- I can drink.

248
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,040
Yes. Thank you.

249
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,920
Well, listen,
you have a lovely night.

250
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,240
And don't let anybody
sleep in your room

251
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,680
because you don't know
who to trust anymore.

252
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,920
Thank God this bed's not hard.

253
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,720
This bed is just right.

254
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,320
Who's making that bloody noise?

255
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,640
It's 4 am!

256
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:02,880
Ahh, who's been
eating my porridge?

257
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,120
- Good morning, Simon.
- Good morning, sir. How are you?

258
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,440
I'm good.
How was your night?

259
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,640
Ahh, it was okay.

260
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,440
Just, you know, I'm starving now
cos I did a bit of workout.

261
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,840
I know how you feel.

262
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,960
Mm-hmm. Mmm!

263
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,760
This doesn't taste very good.
How's yours?

264
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,720
Mine's a bit too hot.

265
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,240
Yeah. I gotta ask you, right?

266
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,120
Don't you think it's strange?
Four plates, four bowls...

267
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,320
Like, what...
what the fuck?

268
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,240
- What do you think?
- Yeah.

269
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,680
- It does seem a bit strange.
- Mm-hmm.

270
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,160
Maybe they like the number four?
Could be a family of four.

271
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,720
So did you really do
this or was it one of the guys?

272
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,920
Perhaps Nicole or Kelly.

273
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,440
Aww! Good morning!

274
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,440
- Good morning.
- Oh, someone's made breakfast!

275
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,040
- Good job, Simon!
- Oh!

276
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,440
Just talking to Jas about that.

277
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,160
We don't know
who did it, you know?

278
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,960
Don't know, it's strange.

279
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,840
How did you sleep?

280
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:13,400
Ah, well, some may say
like a baby bear.

281
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,400
Here I am. Oh, sweet!

282
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,680
Porridge and a cup of tea!

283
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,680
Perfect thing to wake me up

284
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,840
after being shafted
by a cold shower.

285
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,960
Well, I can think
of other ways to start the day.

286
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,640
Geez!

287
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,720
That tea was way too hot!

288
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,120
Sorry, guys.

289
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,600
Oh, George!

290
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,840
- Mmm.
- Oh, no.

291
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,440
Oh, God.

292
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,800
That porridge is way too cold!

293
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,680
You know what you
can actually do?

294
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,400
Pour the hot tea
in your porridge

295
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,040
and have it that way.

296
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,680
Genius!

297
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:23,440
Mmm. Now this is just right.

298
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,120
- Thanks, Simon.
- Mm-hmm.

299
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,520
Has anyone seen Nicole?

300
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,880
- No.
- I'm gonna go for a shower soon,

301
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,280
so I can check in on her room
and see if she's still in there.

302
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,240
Good luck with the shower.

303
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,200
- What do you mean?
- No hot water.

304
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,360
I checked the water supply
this morning.

305
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,680
Turns out somebody
has cut off the water tank.

306
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,400
- Oh.
- Does anyone know about this?

307
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,960
Who cuts off the water supply
on the first night?

308
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,960
- Yeah.
- That's not normal.

309
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,840
You are overthinking it.

310
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,600
- I don't think I am.
- Mm-hmm.

311
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,280
- Okay.
- This tastes off.

312
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,480
- How's yours?
- Really hot.

313
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,480
You mean cold.
How much wine did you drink?

314
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,560
I'm gonna go get
a shower and let this cool down.

315
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,160
Mm-hmm.

316
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,200
We've got to get ready
to leave as well soon.

317
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,880
I had to put another jumper on.
I was getting cold.

318
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,400
- Ohh.
- Where's the car?

319
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,120
It was just there
last night.

320
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,960
You telling me
she's driven off without us?

321
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,720
Hey, guys, we can't find...

322
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,920
Oh, for fuck's sake.

323
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,560
Is this another prank?

324
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,720
So you really think
it's Nicole?

325
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:01,160
Yeah, she's been
having, like, medication stuff.

326
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,000
Simon, are you okay?

327
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,200
I've just got a bad headache,
that's all.

328
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,400
No, she's been taking
a lot of...

329
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,800
Grab him, Jas.

330
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,600
Let's get him inside.

331
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,680
Come on, Simon.
Come on.

332
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,200
God.

333
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,440
What could it be?

334
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,760
Not sure.

335
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,480
Maybe something he ate?

336
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,560
All he's had is porridge
and a protein bar.

337
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,640
I think he's been poisoned.

338
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,680
That's not possible.
We all ate the porridge.

339
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,440
I knew
we should've had a fry-up.

340
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,280
It's not the time
for jokes.

341
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,400
- Sorry.
- I'll get him a glass of water.

342
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,840
Good idea.

343
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,720
Don't worry, Simon.
I'll get you some help.

344
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,640
- Want me to come with?
- No thanks, George.

345
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,240
I'll be quicker on my own.

346
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,960
Where are you going?
Don't go too far!

347
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,880
- Simon?
- Who's there?

348
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,840
You'll be okay.

349
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,680
Yeah, you're still quite hot.

350
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,920
Does that mean get some water?

351
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,480
I'll get you a glass of water.

352
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,680
Hello?

353
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,840
Hello?

354
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,400
Shit, I just saw
someone outside.

355
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,360
What the hell?

356
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,920
It's probably just
Jas playing games.

357
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,800
No, that is not Jas.

358
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,920
Did we lock the doors?

359
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,600
I think so.

360
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,760
Unless Jas is Houdini,

361
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,520
that's probably just a bunch
of kids messing around.

362
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,440
That's not possible. We are
the only house in this forest.

363
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,040
- It's literally just us.
- What about the landline?

364
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,720
- Still not working.
- Shit.

365
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:00,120
It's not a good idea to call
the police when we broke in.

366
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,960
Shit! What're we gonna do?

367
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,760
We're gonna have to stick
together until Jas gets back.

368
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,640
There's no telling how long
that'll be. I need to check.

369
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,320
You can't do that.
You don't know who's outside.

370
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,960
It's probably the fucking kids.

371
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,720
Just stay here, check on Simon,
and lock the door.

372
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,800
Shit!

373
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,720
Jas?

374
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,320
Jas!

375
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,800
Just as bad as Nicole.

376
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,840
Wake up now!

377
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,480
Got to get
it together, George.

378
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,600
Get it together.

379
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,400
Hello?

380
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,680
Hello?

381
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,160
Hello?

382
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,200
Hello?

383
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,360
Look, whoever this is...

384
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,720
Just fuck off!

385
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,120
Kelly! Kelly!

386
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:12,160
Kelly! Kelly!

387
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,680
Wake up!
There are people outside.

388
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,160
- Who?
- I don't know, four people.

389
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,600
Oh, is it those bastard
teenagers again?

390
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,120
- I don't know.
- I'll kick their bloody arses.

391
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,400
I need some fucking sleep.

392
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,480
Just stay
behind me, okay?

393
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,280
It's warm down here.

394
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,840
George, did you
fucking wake me up for this?

395
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,280
No, no, no!

396
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,120
There was four of them.

397
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,800
And they were
wearing these masks.

398
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,600
And... and...

399
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,880
Oh, for God's sake.
Er...

400
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,480
Simon's still asleep
and Jas will be back soon.

401
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,640
Sorry, Kelly.

402
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,360
My bad.

403
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,400
Just take it down, okay?

404
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,840
What?

405
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,680
George!

406
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,640
George!
George, come here!

407
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,600
Who the fuck are they?

408
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,040
I don't know.
We should do something.

409
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,160
We should go get her.

410
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,840
No, no, no,
something doesn't seem right.

411
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,640
I can run really fast.
I can go untie her.

412
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,520
Er, this looks like a trap.

413
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,240
- Shit!
- Erm...

414
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,160
Okay, I'll go out
and distract them.

415
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,240
You untie her fast.
And I mean fast.

416
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,480
Okay. I need to go get changed.

417
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,400
We should do something.

418
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,600
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

419
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,800
Then let's go.

420
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,800
Let's go, let's go.

421
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,680
What the hell?

422
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,360
Ta-da!

423
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:28,160
Oh!

424
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,400
Oh, my God!

425
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,920
What is going on?

426
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,240
Fuck!

427
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,440
Hmm.

428
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:45,360
Before, it didn't look right,

429
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,880
but now it's just right.

430
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,880
Come on! Come on!

431
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,920
Get the fuck in the car.

432
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,720
Get the fuck in!

433
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:08,800
- Shit!
- How'd you find the car?

434
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,600
Does that matter right now?
It was round the side.

435
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:13,880
Simon!

436
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,920
Simon!

437
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:30,080
Fucking car! Drive!

438
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,400
I can't!

439
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,440
Kelly, run!

440
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:56,640
No, no, no, please!

441
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:00,200
Oh, God, no!
Oh, God, no! Please!

442
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,400
Please, get off me!

443
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,960
Ohh, God!

444
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:57,960
It's breakfast time.

445
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:02,040
You couldn't escape from me.

446
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:05,000
Like one big, happy family.

447
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:32,640
You can't just do this shit
and expect to get away with it.

448
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:36,080
Mmm... maybe you
should have thought

449
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,960
not to break
into the house! Hmm?

450
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,760
- Who are you?
- Hmm?

451
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:49,920
For every action you take,
there is a consequence.

452
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,480
I am Goldilocks,

453
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:56,240
and these are the three bears!

454
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,640
Goldilocks?

455
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:05,160
Oh, fuck off!

456
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,360
You're just a bunch
of fucking psychos

457
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,080
with Halloween masks!

458
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,440
You look ridiculous!

459
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:19,440
Let's try again, shall we?

460
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,880
You broke into our house.

461
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,960
You slept on our beds.

462
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,560
You broke our chair.

463
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,320
You ate our porridge!

464
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:35,680
And now you accuse us
to be criminals?

465
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:40,080
No, no, no.
You are the real criminals.

466
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:43,520
We're the ones serving justice.

467
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,720
Go fuck yourself!

468
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,600
No, no, no!

469
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:01,360
Get off!
Get off me! Get off me!

470
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:04,840
No, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry! Please!

471
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,800
I'm sorry! No! No!

472
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:10,240
Get off me! Get off me!

473
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,040
Please! Please!

474
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:15,440
No! No! No!

475
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:19,520
No! Don't

476
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:22,520
Whatever you're going to do,
you really don't have to do it.

477
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:44,880
I think this one
also wants to play.

478
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,280
Oh my God!

479
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:18,600
No! No! No!

480
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:20,360
You're fucking animals!

481
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:50,240
Your turn now... bitch!

482
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:57,680
Nav! Nav! Nav!

483
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:15,000
Bitch! Bitch! Bitch!
Bitch! Bitch!

484
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,240
Here, drink some water.

485
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:26,680
Thank you.

486
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,360
What's your name?

487
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:35,960
Kelly. My name is Kelly.

488
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:41,160
Okay, I'm Jamie.
And you're safe now.

489
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:48,000
No. They killed everyone.

490
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,160
Who killed everyone?

491
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:59,360
It was Goldilocks
and the three bears, and...

492
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,440
Goldilocks, as in...?

493
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:04,280
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

494
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:08,400
Look, you look like
you haven't slept in days.

495
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:10,480
You're obviously
not thinking clearly.

496
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,480
Why don't you have
a sip of water.

497
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,680
Can you call the police, please?

498
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:18,240
I will. Let me...
just call my husband.

499
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:22,280
As soon as he gets back, we'll
drive you somewhere safe. Okay?

500
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:27,400
It'll be fine. Don't worry.

501
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:30,760
- Thank you.
- Okay.

502
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,520
Here, put this on.
It's nice and warm.

503
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:52,200
As soon as Norman gets back,
we'll drive you somewhere safe.

504
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:56,720
It'll do you good
to have some rest.

505
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:59,560
Let me help you up.

506
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:04,800
It'll be all right.

507
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,760
Please,
just call the police.

508
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:12,600
I will.
Everything will be fine.

509
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:16,440
There you go.

510
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,760
There you go.

511
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:39,720
That's it, just have a rest.
Everything will be fine.

512
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:42,360
Can you please call the police?

513
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,640
I will, don't worry.
It'll be fine.

514
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:05,200
Oh, bloody hell!
Don't do that!

515
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,440
Why are you so jumpy?

516
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:09,720
There's a young girl here.

517
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:12,080
What do you mean? Who?

518
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:16,240
She's in the other room resting.
She's running from something.

519
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:17,560
What girl?

520
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:20,080
She said something
about Goldilocks

521
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,320
and the bears or something.

522
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:23,800
In the woods, she...

523
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:26,400
For fuck's sake,
Goldilocks and the bears?

524
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:27,840
She's probably on drugs
or something.

525
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,880
You know what kids
are like these days.

526
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,040
She really was frightened.

527
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:35,040
She asked me to call the police.

528
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:36,520
The police?

529
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,840
I told her to have
a rest for a while.

530
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:41,120
Thought it best
to wait 'til you got back.

531
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:43,040
We'll let her sleep
the drugs off,

532
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:45,640
then we'll find out
what's wrong with her, okay?

533
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:47,920
You know, I don't mind
helping people,

534
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,760
but don't you think
this is a little bit odd?

535
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:55,520
- What was that?
- You hang on here.

536
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:01,880
Who's there?

537
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,240
Kids.

538
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:12,560
For Christ's sake,
just let my wife go.

539
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:14,240
Do what you want with me.

540
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:21,520
Hmm, I'm so sorry
you got involved in this.

541
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:25,440
Hmm?

542
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:33,280
Huh?

543
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,760
No!

544
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:38,360
No!
Please don't! Please!

545
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:41,360
- We can work it out!
- No!

546
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:47,960
You still don't get it, do you?

547
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:49,600
You still haven't learnt

548
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:52,400
the consequences
of your actions, young bitch!

549
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,880
It's okay. It's okay.

550
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,960
You will understand soon.

551
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:04,040
It's such a shame that
your friends won't see you.

552
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:06,080
It's okay. It's okay.

553
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:15,840
But your best friend
will see it all.

554
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:20,160
Hmm?

555
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:31,400
What's this all about?
What's that girl done to you?

556
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:34,120
Wait, wait, wait.

557
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:42,280
Ah.

558
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:45,400
It's only fair to let
this lovely couple know.

559
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:53,840
I'm bored already.
Let's play a game!

560
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:24,320
No!

561
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:36,880
Why?

562
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:41,920
Aww!

563
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:44,240
Fucking animals!

564
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:46,360
Mm-hmm!

565
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:06,200
No!

566
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:10,320
Ah, now this is just right.

567
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:20,200
Now you see what happens
when you do not pay

568
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:22,800
the consequences
of your actions?

569
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:24,480
Others suffer.

570
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:27,520
You should never have let
her enter your house.

571
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:31,120
If you had not, your husband
would still be breathing,

572
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:35,960
and you would have
a lovely evening together.

573
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:39,600
You understand? Yes?

574
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:50,520
You will now suffer

575
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:54,080
the consequences
of your actions.

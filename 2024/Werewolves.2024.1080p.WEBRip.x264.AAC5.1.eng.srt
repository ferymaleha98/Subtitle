3
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:18,686
Supermoon events occur
when the full moon

4
00:01:18,687 --> 00:01:20,340
is at its closest orbit
to the Earth,

5
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:23,517
roughly 223,000 miles away.

6
00:01:23,518 --> 00:01:26,825
This can happen
multiple times a year, but...

7
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,828
...last year was different.

8
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:33,962
<i>I'm speaking
with Dr. James Aranda.</i>

9
00:01:33,963 --> 00:01:37,400
<i>So tell me, Doctor, why hasn't
this happened before?</i>

10
00:01:37,401 --> 00:01:39,576
Why now?
Is it genetically modified food

11
00:01:39,577 --> 00:01:42,450
- or a weaponized virus?
- All right, let's just, uh...

12
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,148
Let's focus on what we do know.

13
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:49,891
No one, and I mean no one

14
00:01:49,892 --> 00:01:52,460
should be exposed to moonlight
tonight. That's number one.

15
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:55,898
Number two is fear.

16
00:01:56,986 --> 00:01:59,206
Fear makes bad decisions.

17
00:02:00,685 --> 00:02:02,425
Have a plan,

18
00:02:02,426 --> 00:02:03,731
stick to it,

19
00:02:03,732 --> 00:02:05,212
and stay safe.

20
00:02:06,256 --> 00:02:08,214
Number three, number three...

21
00:02:08,215 --> 00:02:10,172
Everyone should know
that we are working

22
00:02:10,173 --> 00:02:12,784
around the clock
to find a solution.

23
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,265
We will survive this.

24
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:37,678
We got you your favorite, Sean.

25
00:02:37,679 --> 00:02:39,507
Chocolate cupcake.

26
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:44,511
We know you loved these
on your birthday.

27
00:02:44,512 --> 00:02:46,166
I wish you were here with us.

28
00:02:48,603 --> 00:02:50,039
I miss you.

29
00:02:51,823 --> 00:02:53,085
We love you, Dad.

30
00:03:46,356 --> 00:03:47,530
Come on, let's go!

31
00:04:23,611 --> 00:04:25,656
No time. Keep moving.

32
00:04:43,413 --> 00:04:47,677
ARANDA [on video]: My team and I
have spent our entire careers,

33
00:04:47,678 --> 00:04:50,072
fighting against some
of nature's worst creations.

34
00:04:51,508 --> 00:04:53,509
Found a way before,

35
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,295
and we will again.

36
00:04:58,036 --> 00:04:59,733
It's important to remember
that this is not just

37
00:04:59,734 --> 00:05:01,518
a global effort.

38
00:05:02,824 --> 00:05:04,433
This is a human effort.

39
00:05:04,434 --> 00:05:08,481
A way of life,
what we stand for,

40
00:05:08,482 --> 00:05:10,701
the people that we love.

41
00:05:12,747 --> 00:05:15,183
This is what
we're fighting for tonight.

42
00:05:17,665 --> 00:05:19,492
Hey.

43
00:05:19,493 --> 00:05:21,407
My mom thought
these might cheer Emma up.

44
00:05:21,408 --> 00:05:23,452
Tell her I said thank you.
I have something for you.

45
00:05:23,453 --> 00:05:24,759
Emma.

46
00:05:26,543 --> 00:05:28,762
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hi, Reagan.

47
00:05:28,763 --> 00:05:30,503
MAN [on TV]:
When the curfew starts,

48
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:33,462
please don't go outside.
Please find shelter...

49
00:05:33,463 --> 00:05:35,508
Spare batteries,
in case the power goes out.

50
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:38,075
Make sure your phone is charged.

51
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:39,729
Pepper spray.

52
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,210
Just in case.

53
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:44,996
Thank you so much,
Mrs. Marshall.

54
00:05:45,997 --> 00:05:47,041
Come on.

55
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:55,919
Cody! Cody!

56
00:05:57,574 --> 00:05:59,053
Wesley.

57
00:05:59,054 --> 00:06:01,055
What are you doing, man?
You're shooting your gun

58
00:06:01,056 --> 00:06:03,536
right at Lucy's house.
My niece is inside.

59
00:06:03,537 --> 00:06:05,799
There's kids all over the place.
You can kill somebody.

60
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,497
I'm just trying to get ready
for tonight, Captain.

61
00:06:08,498 --> 00:06:10,586
I'm not in the military
anymore, Cody.

62
00:06:10,587 --> 00:06:12,936
We are all soldiers now.

63
00:06:12,937 --> 00:06:15,852
You see what's happening
in Tokyo right now? Or Sydney?

64
00:06:15,853 --> 00:06:18,594
Hell's coming our way, Wesley.

65
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:20,901
- Hell.
- Is that right?

66
00:06:20,902 --> 00:06:23,120
You know,
I don't understand you, sir.

67
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:24,731
You're here to protect
your brother's family,

68
00:06:24,732 --> 00:06:26,123
and this is how you do it,

69
00:06:26,124 --> 00:06:27,734
with plywood
and chain-link fencing?

70
00:06:27,735 --> 00:06:29,344
You don't worry
about my brother's family.

71
00:06:29,345 --> 00:06:30,476
I got it covered.

72
00:06:30,477 --> 00:06:32,347
I pray to God you do.

73
00:06:32,348 --> 00:06:35,394
Because tonight,
when that sun sets,

74
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,484
it's gonna be
every man for himself.

75
00:06:39,486 --> 00:06:41,269
Good luck tonight, Cody.

76
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,228
I don't need luck.

77
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:54,978
SEAN [on tape]: Hey, Lucy bear.
Repeat after me, okay?

78
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:57,938
- My home is a sacred ground.
- My home is a sacred ground.

79
00:06:57,939 --> 00:06:59,418
I will protect myself

80
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,508
and the ones I love
at all costs.

81
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:05,032
-I am a survivor.
-I'm a survivor.

82
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:07,687
I am strong. I am capable...

83
00:07:07,688 --> 00:07:09,123
All right.
I double and triple-checked

84
00:07:09,124 --> 00:07:11,605
all the windows and locks.

85
00:07:12,867 --> 00:07:14,215
The house is good.

86
00:07:14,216 --> 00:07:16,087
What?

87
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:19,350
The house, it's all locked up.

88
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:20,917
All right,
just like we practiced

89
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:22,223
at the range a thousand times.

90
00:07:22,224 --> 00:07:24,617
You chamber the round,
you aim...

91
00:07:24,618 --> 00:07:26,270
and fire.

92
00:07:26,271 --> 00:07:29,100
Okay. -You're not gonna
have to use this.

93
00:07:30,101 --> 00:07:31,363
Let's go over the rules.

94
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:34,191
Wes, I remember the rules.

95
00:07:34,192 --> 00:07:36,238
Are you sure?

96
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,153
- Don't open the door for anyone.
- Yeah.

97
00:07:39,154 --> 00:07:41,198
Don't make any noise.
Don't draw attention.

98
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,420
Don't hesitate for a second.
I don't care who it is.

99
00:07:45,421 --> 00:07:47,422
- Okay?
- Okay.

100
00:07:47,423 --> 00:07:49,468
All right. You call me
if there's an emergency.

101
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,818
If not, I'll...
I'll reach out to you.

102
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:54,169
We got this.

103
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,910
- Good.
- We're good. We're good.

104
00:07:56,911 --> 00:07:58,172
We're good. Okay.

105
00:08:03,265 --> 00:08:04,745
What's wrong, kiddo?

106
00:08:06,094 --> 00:08:08,095
- Uncle Wes?
- Yeah.

107
00:08:08,096 --> 00:08:09,749
Why can't you stay?

108
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,533
I want to stay.

109
00:08:11,534 --> 00:08:13,187
I want to stay
more than anything,

110
00:08:13,188 --> 00:08:17,017
but they need me to help them
try and stop this.

111
00:08:17,018 --> 00:08:19,281
I don't want to die.

112
00:08:20,717 --> 00:08:23,241
Hey. [sighs] Look at me.

113
00:08:25,156 --> 00:08:27,157
You're not gonna die.

114
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:31,988
Nothing is going
to happen to you, okay?

115
00:08:31,989 --> 00:08:34,556
Do you remember when Daddy
used to tell you that story

116
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:37,254
about the three little pigs
and the big bad wolf?

117
00:08:37,255 --> 00:08:39,256
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

118
00:08:39,257 --> 00:08:41,432
Do you remember why the big bad
wolf couldn't get in the house?

119
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:43,217
Because it was made of bricks?

120
00:08:43,218 --> 00:08:47,918
It was made of bricks,
just like your house.

121
00:08:49,311 --> 00:08:52,575
Nothing is going to get in.
I made sure of it.

122
00:08:54,664 --> 00:08:56,187
I promise.

123
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,736
It's getting late.

124
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:26,566
You should get going.

125
00:09:29,307 --> 00:09:30,960
I don't think I can do this.

126
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:32,572
Wesley...

127
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:37,359
We're the only family
we have left.

128
00:09:38,969 --> 00:09:41,275
They'll figure it out.
They'll understand.

129
00:09:41,276 --> 00:09:43,974
They can't do this without you.

130
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,673
And Sean...

131
00:09:47,674 --> 00:09:49,937
he would want you to go.

132
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,291
"Always ready."

133
00:10:59,397 --> 00:11:01,137
Let's go! Let's go! Come on!

134
00:11:01,138 --> 00:11:04,010
Let's go! Let's go!
Move it! Drive on. This way.

135
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:06,665
MAN [on P.A.]: Transportation
to the underground is limited.

136
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,406
Bring only what you need
to survive the night.

137
00:11:09,407 --> 00:11:12,409
Thank you for your cooperation.

138
00:11:14,761 --> 00:11:16,500
MAN [on P.A.]: Curfew is
in place for your protection.

139
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:18,460
Please return
to your homes immediately.

140
00:11:20,331 --> 00:11:22,203
One second, sir.

141
00:11:24,335 --> 00:11:27,163
MAN [on P.A.]: Transportation
to the underground is limited.

142
00:11:27,164 --> 00:11:28,991
Bring only what you need
to survive the night.

143
00:11:28,992 --> 00:11:30,951
All right.
Go ahead, Dr. Marshall.

144
00:11:31,952 --> 00:11:34,344
Thank you.

145
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:37,218
MAN [on P.A.]: Curfew is
in place for your protection.

146
00:11:56,237 --> 00:11:57,717
Yeah, okay.

147
00:12:34,362 --> 00:12:35,841
MAN [on radio]: They don't
care about our rights.

148
00:12:35,842 --> 00:12:36,972
WOMAN [on radio]:
That's right. Our right

149
00:12:36,973 --> 00:12:38,669
is to kill these motherfuckers.

150
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,758
MAN [on radio]: Yeah, yeah.
It's up to us tonight

151
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,194
to fight these things.

152
00:12:41,195 --> 00:12:43,370
It's up to us
to keep America safe.

153
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:44,588
WOMAN [on radio]:
We are supposed to keep

154
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:46,547
our people safe.

155
00:12:46,548 --> 00:12:48,114
MAN [on radio]: That's right.
They're not gonna do it for us.

156
00:12:48,115 --> 00:12:50,943
We have to do it for ourselves.

157
00:12:50,944 --> 00:12:54,381
<i>I trust that everyone
made plans for your loved ones.</i>

158
00:12:54,382 --> 00:12:57,079
I know it's not easy.

159
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,603
We have a nine-hour window

160
00:12:59,604 --> 00:13:03,738
to assess, test,
and report our findings.

161
00:13:03,739 --> 00:13:07,176
I would like to introduce
Wesley Marshall,

162
00:13:07,177 --> 00:13:09,439
Global Rapid Response
team leader

163
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,051
and lead molecular biologist.

164
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:14,227
Evan Radcliffe
is second in command.

165
00:13:14,228 --> 00:13:16,055
And Amy Chen,

166
00:13:16,056 --> 00:13:20,711
chief <i>Canis lupus</i> biologist
and behavioralist.

167
00:13:20,712 --> 00:13:23,454
They have been spearheading
our work here tonight.

168
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,459
Now we know that the supermoon

169
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,200
triggers rapid DNA mutation,

170
00:13:31,201 --> 00:13:33,115
and is photosensitive
to moonlight.

171
00:13:33,116 --> 00:13:37,163
We hope to see
if this mutation can be blocked.

172
00:13:37,164 --> 00:13:39,643
This team standing behind me
has developed a liquid

173
00:13:39,644 --> 00:13:43,169
we call "Moonscreen."

174
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,866
It is our hope

175
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:47,521
that this Moonscreen
acts as a barrier

176
00:13:47,522 --> 00:13:50,177
between the moonlight
and human DNA.

177
00:13:53,528 --> 00:13:58,662
What we discover tonight could
go a long way to finding a cure.

178
00:13:58,663 --> 00:14:01,230
It is not hyperbole to say

179
00:14:01,231 --> 00:14:05,888
that our discoveries
could save millions of lives.

180
00:14:08,586 --> 00:14:11,675
Emergency services
will be suspended

181
00:14:11,676 --> 00:14:14,243
from sunset to sunrise.

182
00:14:14,244 --> 00:14:17,595
Please stay out
of the moonlight.

183
00:14:20,598 --> 00:14:21,861
Good luck tonight.

184
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:31,434
WOMAN [on P.A.]: Please
be advised, for your safety,

185
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:33,436
we are now in full lockdown.

186
00:14:33,437 --> 00:14:35,177
No one will be permitted
to enter

187
00:14:35,178 --> 00:14:37,310
or leave the facility
until daybreak.

188
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:40,140
All exit points
have been sealed.

189
00:15:08,037 --> 00:15:10,344
Subject
number three entering facility.

190
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,740
Subject number three
entering facility.

191
00:15:22,573 --> 00:15:24,053
<i>Amy...</i>

192
00:15:26,838 --> 00:15:30,930
Whatever happens tonight,
remember, it is my choice.

193
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,411
I know.

194
00:15:37,849 --> 00:15:39,721
I love you, Dr. Chen.

195
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:07,704
Don't worry, Dr. Chen.

196
00:16:07,705 --> 00:16:09,968
We've taken
every safety precaution.

197
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,058
He's gonna be okay.

198
00:16:23,765 --> 00:16:25,896
Myles can feel the supermoon
is about to rise.

199
00:16:25,897 --> 00:16:28,639
All the Year Oners
know it's close.

200
00:16:29,858 --> 00:16:31,425
They can feel it.

201
00:16:33,427 --> 00:16:37,647
Whatever turned him last year
left a compulsive craving.

202
00:16:37,648 --> 00:16:39,999
He's an addict without a fix.

203
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,219
Until tonight.

204
00:16:52,968 --> 00:16:54,229
MAN [on radio]:
We are now entering

205
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,926
the final hour of daylight.

206
00:16:55,927 --> 00:16:59,017
Our prayers are with everyone,

207
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,888
and the team at Aranda Corp.

208
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:03,064
Let us hope they find us a cure.

209
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:07,416
Stay safe out there, everyone,
and Godspeed.

210
00:17:10,594 --> 00:17:13,901
Scoot over, kiddo.
Mama needs in on this game.

211
00:17:13,902 --> 00:17:16,164
You know
I always beat you, right?

212
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:18,732
Oh, it's like, it's like that?
Is it like that?

213
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:20,647
Is it really like that?

214
00:17:20,648 --> 00:17:23,171
But who wins the tickling?

215
00:17:23,172 --> 00:17:26,871
Who-who-who? Who wins at
tickling, Emma? Tell me.

216
00:17:29,874 --> 00:17:33,007
30 minutes to canopy retraction.

217
00:17:33,008 --> 00:17:35,141
30 minutes to canopy retraction.

218
00:17:36,272 --> 00:17:38,361
30 minutes to canopy retraction.

219
00:17:43,627 --> 00:17:46,674
Hey. You okay?

220
00:17:49,155 --> 00:17:51,330
We're in it together. Yeah?

221
00:17:51,331 --> 00:17:55,596
Breathe. Just breathe.

222
00:18:01,254 --> 00:18:03,952
Three, two, one...

223
00:18:09,566 --> 00:18:10,785
Go time.

224
00:18:19,446 --> 00:18:21,273
All staff to stations.

225
00:18:21,274 --> 00:18:23,753
Hey, Phil,
we're over here on Subject One.

226
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:26,366
Copy. Moving in.

227
00:18:28,846 --> 00:18:31,066
Sir. Step forward.

228
00:18:33,329 --> 00:18:34,896
Good luck tonight, sir.

229
00:18:36,724 --> 00:18:38,333
Whoa, whoa, ma'am, ma'am.

230
00:18:38,334 --> 00:18:41,423
Ma'am, I need you to stay calm.

231
00:18:41,424 --> 00:18:43,251
Your heart rate
is incredibly elevated.

232
00:18:43,252 --> 00:18:44,992
Good.

233
00:18:44,993 --> 00:18:47,212
Hey, hey, you sure this guy

234
00:18:47,213 --> 00:18:49,127
passed the psych eval?

235
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,825
It's not like
we had a lot of volunteers.

236
00:18:51,826 --> 00:18:53,696
[sighs] How come
I always get the crazy ones?

237
00:18:53,697 --> 00:18:56,046
Right?

238
00:18:56,047 --> 00:18:59,093
Moonscreen
temperature... stable.

239
00:18:59,094 --> 00:19:00,964
I really don't like
the name "Moonscreen."

240
00:19:00,965 --> 00:19:03,664
We commence in ten minutes.
Ten-minute warning.

241
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:07,928
Ten-minute warning.

242
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:09,799
Ten-minute warning.

243
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,627
I can't believe
they volunteered for this.

244
00:19:11,628 --> 00:19:13,673
- Let me get in there.
- Go ahead.

245
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:15,370
Excuse me, sir.

246
00:19:15,371 --> 00:19:16,632
You don't even know
if the Moonscreen will work.

247
00:19:16,633 --> 00:19:19,548
It'll work. It has to work.

248
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:22,421
Subject Three,
step forward, please.

249
00:19:22,422 --> 00:19:24,336
Don't worry,
it's just a liquid nanotech

250
00:19:24,337 --> 00:19:25,554
to protect your eyes.

251
00:19:25,555 --> 00:19:26,687
It won't hurt.

252
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,736
All right.
Liquid lens team out.

253
00:19:33,737 --> 00:19:36,783
- Formula team in.
-Vitals out.

254
00:19:36,784 --> 00:19:39,568
God, I hope this works.
Good luck tonight, guys.

255
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:40,875
Keep moving.

256
00:19:41,702 --> 00:19:43,398
Good luck.

257
00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:45,313
Five minutes
to canopy retraction.

258
00:19:45,314 --> 00:19:47,185
Five minutes

259
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,013
to canopy retraction.

260
00:19:52,713 --> 00:19:55,368
Spray him down.
Make sure you get all of it.

261
00:19:57,979 --> 00:19:59,328
Start the clock.

262
00:20:00,547 --> 00:20:02,157
Notate how long
the screen lasts.

263
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,898
Starting the clock.

264
00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:06,291
All right, spray down.

265
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:07,727
Security, be ready.

266
00:20:07,728 --> 00:20:08,989
Screen them up, guys.
Screen them up.

267
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,034
Good over here.

268
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,954
Chin up, chin up.

269
00:20:21,307 --> 00:20:24,265
Three minutes
to canopy retraction.

270
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:26,528
Three minutes
to canopy retraction.

271
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:28,965
Three minutes to
canopy retraction.

272
00:20:28,966 --> 00:20:31,446
What happens if one of them
decides to moon the sky

273
00:20:31,447 --> 00:20:33,753
once we open up this roof?

274
00:20:33,754 --> 00:20:36,625
The formula penetrates
the thin fibers, Evan.

275
00:20:36,626 --> 00:20:38,889
No one's showing their ass
and turning tonight.

276
00:20:43,111 --> 00:20:45,635
I changed my mind.

277
00:20:48,377 --> 00:20:50,422
Hey. Hey.

278
00:20:50,423 --> 00:20:51,988
Hey. Are you listening to me?

279
00:20:51,989 --> 00:20:53,642
We're losing Subject One.

280
00:20:53,643 --> 00:20:55,992
Two minutes
to canopy retraction.

281
00:20:55,993 --> 00:20:57,342
Help me!

282
00:20:57,343 --> 00:20:59,344
Two minutes
to canopy retraction.

283
00:21:00,694 --> 00:21:02,956
Wait, wait, where are you going?

284
00:21:02,957 --> 00:21:05,480
Please, let me out of here!

285
00:21:05,481 --> 00:21:07,266
-Should we sedate her?
- No.

286
00:21:08,528 --> 00:21:11,226
Sedatives could interfere
with the test results.

287
00:21:13,184 --> 00:21:15,708
She knew what
she was getting into.

288
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:17,927
I don't want to turn. No.

289
00:21:19,234 --> 00:21:21,714
Please open this gate!

290
00:21:21,715 --> 00:21:23,803
Hey! It's gonna be okay.

291
00:21:23,804 --> 00:21:25,021
No.

292
00:21:26,589 --> 00:21:30,157
- Just relax. It's gonna work.
- Hey!

293
00:21:32,116 --> 00:21:34,640
30 seconds
to canopy retraction.

294
00:21:34,641 --> 00:21:35,684
Get me the fuck out of here!

295
00:21:35,685 --> 00:21:37,860
30 seconds to canopy retraction.

296
00:21:37,861 --> 00:21:39,994
30 seconds
to canopy retraction.

297
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:52,440
- Canopy retraction commencing.
- Oh, it's coming.

298
00:21:52,441 --> 00:21:58,707
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

299
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,231
five, four,

300
00:22:01,232 --> 00:22:03,712
- three, two, one...
- Ambrosia!

301
00:22:03,713 --> 00:22:06,454
Oh, my God.
Please, don't do this to me.

302
00:22:06,455 --> 00:22:08,457
Canopy retraction commencing.

303
00:22:10,067 --> 00:22:11,895
Canopy retraction commencing.

304
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,552
Canopy retraction commencing.

305
00:22:26,475 --> 00:22:28,781
Yeah!

306
00:22:48,236 --> 00:22:50,499
What's happening?!

307
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:54,372
He's fine. It fucking worked.

308
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,286
I think we're through.

309
00:22:56,287 --> 00:22:58,159
I think we did it.

310
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:10,519
Dr. Aranda,
I think it's holding.

311
00:23:13,783 --> 00:23:15,741
Start pulling fluid
and tissue biopsies.

312
00:23:15,742 --> 00:23:17,525
Let's get everything
analyzed ASAP.

313
00:23:17,526 --> 00:23:19,527
Subjects Two
and Three are Year Oners.

314
00:23:19,528 --> 00:23:21,050
I want a comparison test

315
00:23:21,051 --> 00:23:23,009
to see if they exhibit
any abnormalities

316
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,054
relative to our test group.

317
00:23:25,055 --> 00:23:26,882
Dr. Chen,

318
00:23:26,883 --> 00:23:28,928
I need you to analyze
those blood samples

319
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:30,886
from our <i>Canis lupus.</i>

320
00:23:30,887 --> 00:23:32,585
Yes, sir.

321
00:23:55,956 --> 00:23:57,347
Hey, I'll be right outside.

322
00:23:57,348 --> 00:23:59,219
I just wanna go
check on things, okay?

323
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,570
Stay here.

324
00:24:45,788 --> 00:24:47,224
Mom?

325
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:44,804
Stepping in now.

326
00:25:47,328 --> 00:25:48,328
Congratulations, Doctor.

327
00:25:48,329 --> 00:25:50,243
Stable.

328
00:25:50,244 --> 00:25:51,984
Blood's looking good.

329
00:25:51,985 --> 00:25:53,812
- Let's relay positive results.
- Very nice. Looks good.

330
00:25:53,813 --> 00:25:57,424
Mitosis seems
to be holding, no mutations.

331
00:25:57,425 --> 00:25:59,470
How are the samples
looking, Wes?

332
00:26:02,473 --> 00:26:03,997
You seeing this?

333
00:26:10,351 --> 00:26:11,656
Is it parasitic?

334
00:26:11,657 --> 00:26:13,135
I don't know.
It looks like it

335
00:26:13,136 --> 00:26:15,747
might be kind of
an immunological defense system.

336
00:26:15,748 --> 00:26:17,400
Whatever this mutation is,

337
00:26:17,401 --> 00:26:18,837
it looks like the supermoon's

338
00:26:18,838 --> 00:26:21,317
triggering
a dormant defense response.

339
00:26:21,318 --> 00:26:23,232
But why is it only now reactive?

340
00:26:23,233 --> 00:26:25,800
Could it be viral
or pathological?

341
00:26:25,801 --> 00:26:27,628
I don't know yet.

342
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:31,241
Evan, bring me
a different tissue sample.

343
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,334
Subject Three is turning.

344
00:26:38,335 --> 00:26:39,640
Moonscreen stability
at one hour.

345
00:26:41,948 --> 00:26:43,602
Stay back.
Everybody, stay back.

346
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:54,437
Fuck.

347
00:26:54,438 --> 00:26:56,092
Get that formula spraying now.

348
00:26:58,486 --> 00:27:00,182
Yes!

349
00:27:00,183 --> 00:27:02,055
Where the fuck
is the Moonscreen?

350
00:27:06,581 --> 00:27:07,886
Oh, fuck!

351
00:27:07,887 --> 00:27:09,322
Dr. Aranda, what's the status?

352
00:27:09,323 --> 00:27:10,192
- Look out! Look out!
- Move back!

353
00:27:10,193 --> 00:27:11,411
Get back now!

354
00:27:12,979 --> 00:27:14,415
Dr. Aranda!

355
00:27:16,504 --> 00:27:18,766
Spray the formula, now.

356
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:19,986
Yeah, yeah, all right.

357
00:27:28,255 --> 00:27:29,343
Watch out!

358
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:32,433
Move, move!

359
00:27:34,478 --> 00:27:36,523
Oh, shit.

360
00:27:36,524 --> 00:27:39,831
Close the roof!
Close the roof!

361
00:27:39,832 --> 00:27:40,876
Go!

362
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,185
The roof isn't closing.

363
00:27:46,186 --> 00:27:47,970
Canopy malfunctioning.

364
00:27:48,971 --> 00:27:51,146
Canopy malfunctioning.

365
00:28:11,951 --> 00:28:13,256
Everyone get to an exit.

366
00:28:13,953 --> 00:28:15,344
Now!

367
00:28:15,345 --> 00:28:17,346
James! James, are you okay?

368
00:28:17,347 --> 00:28:20,350
My suit... my suit ripped.

369
00:28:22,048 --> 00:28:23,439
You're gonna be okay.
You hear me?

370
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,487
He's been exposed.
He's been exposed.

371
00:28:27,488 --> 00:28:29,141
Wes, what the fuck
did you just say?

372
00:28:29,142 --> 00:28:30,578
I need a tranquilizer now.

373
00:28:31,797 --> 00:28:32,798
Evan, hurry up.

374
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,673
-Wes, go.
-James, stay with me.

375
00:28:39,892 --> 00:28:41,893
Fuck, he's turning.

376
00:28:43,939 --> 00:28:45,592
Where is the tranquilizer?

377
00:28:45,593 --> 00:28:48,247
I'm coming!

378
00:28:48,248 --> 00:28:50,597
James, stay with me.
James! You can fight this.

379
00:28:50,598 --> 00:28:54,907
Get away from me! Get away!

380
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,787
Hit him with the tranquilizer!

381
00:29:18,365 --> 00:29:21,062
- I can't breathe.
- Fuck.

382
00:29:21,063 --> 00:29:22,761
Go! Let's go, let's go!

383
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:35,033
Go!

384
00:29:38,733 --> 00:29:40,648
I can't breathe.

385
00:29:42,171 --> 00:29:44,738
I'm living.
I can't... I can't breathe.

386
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:48,655
Attention. All staff,

387
00:29:48,656 --> 00:29:50,310
please move to emergency exits.

388
00:29:52,921 --> 00:29:54,617
Finish gathering
the blood samples.

389
00:29:54,618 --> 00:29:56,750
Then I want you
moving to an exit.

390
00:29:56,751 --> 00:29:57,838
Attention. All staff,

391
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:58,970
please move to emergency exits.

392
00:30:00,233 --> 00:30:02,060
I got you. You're okay.

393
00:30:02,061 --> 00:30:03,409
Attention. All staff,

394
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:05,150
please move to emergency exits.

395
00:30:05,151 --> 00:30:07,630
It's okay.

396
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:09,284
Attention. All staff,

397
00:30:09,285 --> 00:30:10,503
please move to emergency exits.

398
00:30:10,504 --> 00:30:11,852
Is everyone okay?

399
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:14,072
I gotta get out of here.

400
00:30:14,073 --> 00:30:15,116
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

401
00:30:15,117 --> 00:30:16,815
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet.

402
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,992
- Where the fuck are you?
-I can't...

403
00:30:20,993 --> 00:30:24,952
I can't see anything.
I don't wanna fucking die.

404
00:30:24,953 --> 00:30:27,346
No, okay.
Everyone just stay calm.

405
00:30:27,347 --> 00:30:29,565
We're gonna get out of here.

406
00:30:34,354 --> 00:30:35,834
No!

407
00:30:38,924 --> 00:30:40,969
Got you,
you wolf piece of shit!

408
00:30:47,802 --> 00:30:49,847
Die, you fucking bastard!

409
00:30:56,637 --> 00:30:57,986
Just go, just go.

410
00:30:59,553 --> 00:31:02,163
Get out! Go, go!

411
00:31:02,164 --> 00:31:03,599
- What's happening?
-Sorry.

412
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,601
Keep going.
To your right. Keep going.

413
00:31:07,735 --> 00:31:09,868
You're okay.
You're gonna be okay.

414
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:13,741
Stay with me. Come on.

415
00:31:21,053 --> 00:31:23,751
No, no, no! Go! Go, go!

416
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,502
Wes.

417
00:31:36,503 --> 00:31:39,679
Oh, my God, Evan! Infirmary.

418
00:31:43,292 --> 00:31:44,424
Out of the hall.

419
00:31:45,425 --> 00:31:46,991
Go!

420
00:31:46,992 --> 00:31:49,777
Wes, it's not working.

421
00:31:53,868 --> 00:31:54,868
Wes...

422
00:32:04,357 --> 00:32:05,401
Go!

423
00:32:15,716 --> 00:32:17,892
Go! Go!

424
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:27,161
Shoot it! Shoot it!

425
00:32:38,565 --> 00:32:40,088
Jesus Christ!

426
00:34:00,603 --> 00:34:03,736
All right. You're all right.

427
00:34:03,737 --> 00:34:04,867
We have to stop the bleeding.

428
00:34:04,868 --> 00:34:06,826
Move, move, move, move, move!

429
00:34:06,827 --> 00:34:08,393
-Okay.
- Okay, hold it down. Pressure!

430
00:34:08,394 --> 00:34:10,917
Pressure. Evan?
Evan, stick with us, okay?

431
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:13,093
You just breathe slowly. We're
gonna get you patched up, okay?

432
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:14,834
-Breathe, Evan, breathe.
- Hold both hands. Both...

433
00:34:14,835 --> 00:34:16,575
-I got it. I got it.
- Both hands. Hold it down.

434
00:34:16,576 --> 00:34:19,883
Evan, just stay with us.
Evan? Evan?

435
00:34:23,148 --> 00:34:24,584
Evan?

436
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:32,026
- Evan. No! Evan...
- He's gone. He's gone.

437
00:34:33,593 --> 00:34:36,334
What...
This wasn't supposed to happen.

438
00:34:36,335 --> 00:34:37,857
This isn't... this isn't...

439
00:34:37,858 --> 00:34:40,077
Okay.

440
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,557
I need... Myles.

441
00:34:42,558 --> 00:34:43,993
- No, no, no, no.
- No, no, no, no!

442
00:34:43,994 --> 00:34:45,604
- I have to get to Myles.
- Amy, Amy.

443
00:34:45,605 --> 00:34:47,562
- Look at me! He turned.
- No! Let me go.

444
00:34:47,563 --> 00:34:49,651
- No, the formula was working.
- Amy! Amy!

445
00:34:49,652 --> 00:34:51,566
It didn't!
It didn't last for him.

446
00:34:51,567 --> 00:34:53,612
- No!
- He turned. I'm sorry.

447
00:34:53,613 --> 00:34:55,396
We were too late with Myles.

448
00:34:55,397 --> 00:34:57,051
- I'm sorry.
- No.

449
00:34:59,053 --> 00:35:00,315
I'm sorry.

450
00:35:13,372 --> 00:35:15,373
I think we should just
stay here and wait for help.

451
00:35:15,374 --> 00:35:16,983
We're not staying here,
we can't stay here.

452
00:35:16,984 --> 00:35:18,332
We're not staying here.
There's no more time.

453
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:20,029
No, if we leave here,
we are gonna die.

454
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:22,162
If we stay, we die. Listen.

455
00:35:22,163 --> 00:35:25,339
No more guns, no more guards.
There's nothing left.

456
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,428
Those things are coming for us.

457
00:35:27,429 --> 00:35:29,256
That door's not gonna stop them.

458
00:35:29,257 --> 00:35:31,476
Wes, think about
what you are saying.

459
00:35:31,477 --> 00:35:34,914
If we make it past those walls,
we're gonna face the moonlight.

460
00:35:34,915 --> 00:35:37,438
We got the formula. It works.

461
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:39,658
We need more than the formula,
Wes. We need...

462
00:35:39,659 --> 00:35:40,964
Guns.

463
00:35:42,227 --> 00:35:45,534
- A plan.
- That is the plan.

464
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:58,014
Fuck.

465
00:37:59,146 --> 00:38:02,367
- Get the weapons.
- Here, cover up.

466
00:38:23,953 --> 00:38:26,304
The formula will last
about an hour.

467
00:38:28,784 --> 00:38:30,524
Close your eyes.

468
00:38:30,525 --> 00:38:32,744
I'm gonna set my watch.
You set yours.

469
00:38:32,745 --> 00:38:34,007
If one of us turns...

470
00:38:35,051 --> 00:38:37,183
I'm not shooting you, Wes.

471
00:38:37,184 --> 00:38:39,707
If one of us turns,
we lose the other, yeah?

472
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:41,927
- Yeah.
- Say it.

473
00:38:41,928 --> 00:38:43,103
Yes.

474
00:38:45,453 --> 00:38:47,802
When's the last time
you used one of these?

475
00:38:47,803 --> 00:38:51,415
Outside a paper target,
when you and I were in Malaysia.

476
00:38:51,416 --> 00:38:53,939
Well, let's pretend
they're paper targets

477
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,029
that are gonna eat us.

478
00:39:04,907 --> 00:39:06,212
No.

479
00:39:12,175 --> 00:39:13,438
It's Myles.

480
00:39:14,308 --> 00:39:15,788
Go.

481
00:39:22,229 --> 00:39:23,448
Don't slow down.

482
00:39:26,799 --> 00:39:28,017
I won't.

483
00:39:32,979 --> 00:39:34,283
-Wes.
- You guys okay?

484
00:39:34,284 --> 00:39:36,198
Yes, we're okay,
but there was gunfire.

485
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:37,591
They got inside the houses.

486
00:39:37,592 --> 00:39:39,071
I know they're still out there.

487
00:39:39,072 --> 00:39:40,551
I know they are.
I just can't see them. I can't--

488
00:39:40,552 --> 00:39:41,987
What? What happened?

489
00:39:41,988 --> 00:39:43,771
I think they attacked Cody.
I saw them

490
00:39:43,772 --> 00:39:45,207
getting into his house.
And if they can get into his,

491
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:47,166
- I just...
- Lucy, this is Dr. Chen.

492
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:49,734
Just stay calm.
The noise will attract them.

493
00:39:49,735 --> 00:39:50,997
Okay. Okay.

494
00:39:52,607 --> 00:39:54,000
Mrs. Marshall!

495
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:57,872
- Luce?
-Mrs. Marshall,

496
00:39:57,873 --> 00:40:00,310
Mrs. Marshall, it's me!

497
00:40:09,842 --> 00:40:11,451
There's someone at the gate.

498
00:40:11,452 --> 00:40:13,235
Don't answer it, okay?

499
00:40:13,236 --> 00:40:15,760
Mrs. Marshall, it's me, Reagan.

500
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:20,939
Oh, my God, it's-it's Reagan.
She's outside.

501
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,897
I don't care who it is!
Don't answer it.

502
00:40:22,898 --> 00:40:25,073
-I need help!
- But...

503
00:40:25,074 --> 00:40:27,859
It killed my mom.
Please, Mrs. Marshall!

504
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:32,124
I can go get her.
I can cover up and go get her.

505
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:33,734
Lucy, listen to me.

506
00:40:33,735 --> 00:40:35,736
It's Reagan, Wes.

507
00:40:35,737 --> 00:40:38,392
Don't answer it.
She could have turned. Lucy!

508
00:40:40,133 --> 00:40:42,351
- Hey, Reagan, hold on.
- Lucy!

509
00:40:42,352 --> 00:40:44,223
I'm gonna come get you,
all right? I'm gonna...

510
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,965
No! No!

511
00:40:46,966 --> 00:40:48,923
- Don't answer the door.
-Wes.

512
00:40:52,101 --> 00:40:53,363
Wes?

513
00:41:07,856 --> 00:41:09,204
Oh, God.

514
00:41:09,205 --> 00:41:12,992
My home is a sacred ground. I...

515
00:41:14,646 --> 00:41:20,520
I will protect myself
and the ones I love.

516
00:41:20,521 --> 00:41:23,697
I am a survivor.
I am a strong...

517
00:41:27,136 --> 00:41:28,442
Oh, my God!

518
00:41:41,107 --> 00:41:45,546
Fuck you, Sean. Fuck you,
you selfless hero prick! I...

519
00:41:49,942 --> 00:41:51,638
How could you?

520
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:54,119
How could you leave us alone?
I... I...

521
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,643
Oh, come here.

522
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,823
-  I miss Daddy.
- I know you do.

523
00:42:02,824 --> 00:42:04,043
I know you do.

524
00:42:06,262 --> 00:42:07,525
I know, baby.

525
00:42:26,587 --> 00:42:28,719
Go! Go!

526
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,763
Move!

527
00:42:37,424 --> 00:42:40,295
- My phone.
- No, come on. Wes.

528
00:42:40,296 --> 00:42:42,429
- My phone.
- Get up! Get up!

529
00:42:43,169 --> 00:42:45,300
Get up!

530
00:42:45,301 --> 00:42:47,956
Come on, Wes. Come on.

531
00:43:11,763 --> 00:43:14,503
Hey, I need you to stay
in your fort

532
00:43:14,504 --> 00:43:17,203
and keep your headphones on.
Can you do that for me?

533
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,858
Go.

534
00:43:41,749 --> 00:43:43,621
There you are.

535
00:43:57,547 --> 00:43:59,506
This is for Reagan.

536
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:26,880
Hey, listen.

537
00:44:26,881 --> 00:44:30,754
At this point,
all we are is prey.

538
00:44:30,755 --> 00:44:34,758
Wolves are predators, and they
hunt their prey on the run.

539
00:44:34,759 --> 00:44:36,674
What are you saying?
We shouldn't run?

540
00:44:39,285 --> 00:44:44,985
I'm saying, a wolf or two,
we can run, confuse them.

541
00:44:44,986 --> 00:44:48,337
But a big pack...
we got to stand our ground.

542
00:44:49,774 --> 00:44:51,600
In a wolf fight,

543
00:44:51,601 --> 00:44:55,388
you either dominate,
run, or die.

544
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:59,130
No more options.

545
00:44:59,131 --> 00:45:00,827
In that case,
you stay as close to me

546
00:45:00,828 --> 00:45:02,395
as humanly possible. Yeah?

547
00:45:17,758 --> 00:45:19,150
Fuck.

548
00:45:23,242 --> 00:45:24,938
I think we should backtrack
and cross over Fifth.

549
00:45:24,939 --> 00:45:29,551
No, it's too far.
We don't have that kind of time.

550
00:45:29,552 --> 00:45:32,946
Our only shot
is around these wolves.

551
00:45:32,947 --> 00:45:35,907
If we cross behind the
parked cars, they won't see us.

552
00:45:36,951 --> 00:45:38,299
Okay.

553
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:41,041
And if we make it through,
what next?

554
00:45:41,042 --> 00:45:42,913
Let's cross that bridge
when we get to it.

555
00:45:42,914 --> 00:45:44,698
Stay close to me.

556
00:46:50,329 --> 00:46:52,722
Where's the third one?
Where's the other one?

557
00:49:26,093 --> 00:49:28,877
Oh, shit.

558
00:49:28,878 --> 00:49:31,359
The formula's gonna wear off.

559
00:49:33,187 --> 00:49:34,405
- Wes.
-Fuck.

560
00:49:34,406 --> 00:49:35,581
I think we should run.

561
00:49:37,278 --> 00:49:40,846
Go, go, go, go.

562
00:49:40,847 --> 00:49:42,717
- We have to get inside.
-How much time do we have?

563
00:49:42,718 --> 00:49:44,633
There's no time.

564
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,084
- There.
- Go.

565
00:50:05,959 --> 00:50:08,047
The gates are closing.

566
00:50:08,048 --> 00:50:09,745
Go, get in! Go!

567
00:50:20,147 --> 00:50:21,148
Hey, guys.

568
00:50:22,889 --> 00:50:24,021
- Follow me.
-Hey!

569
00:51:13,157 --> 00:51:16,289
- What is this place?
- It's a market.

570
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:18,291
Its tunnels
run underneath there.

571
00:51:18,292 --> 00:51:20,425
We could use them
to bypass this shit.

572
00:51:23,819 --> 00:51:25,385
No!

573
00:51:25,386 --> 00:51:27,301
We don't want any trouble.

574
00:51:30,348 --> 00:51:32,044
I will shoot you in your face.

575
00:51:32,045 --> 00:51:36,570
We're scientists. There was
an accident at the lab.

576
00:51:36,571 --> 00:51:38,311
We're working on a cure.

577
00:51:38,312 --> 00:51:39,574
MAN [distorted]:
There is no cure.

578
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:48,539
Your kind don't belong here.

579
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:53,109
Give me a reason why I shouldn't
feed you to the wolves.

580
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,632
We're just trying
to get to my family,

581
00:51:54,633 --> 00:51:56,590
make sure they're safe.
That's it.

582
00:51:56,591 --> 00:51:58,550
We just want to use the tunnels.

583
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:10,300
I'll take you
to the tunnel entrance.

584
00:52:10,301 --> 00:52:14,043
Then...
you're on your own.

585
00:52:30,886 --> 00:52:32,192
Oh, my God.

586
00:54:00,454 --> 00:54:02,934
- Stand back.
- It's gonna be loud.

587
00:54:02,935 --> 00:54:04,371
Hold your ears.

588
00:54:20,082 --> 00:54:22,301
Now!

589
00:55:00,209 --> 00:55:01,341
Die, you fuck.

590
00:55:17,705 --> 00:55:20,186
Wes, come on, let's go. Get up.

591
00:55:36,942 --> 00:55:38,726
Stop!

592
00:55:42,948 --> 00:55:44,644
We need to reapply.

593
00:55:46,647 --> 00:55:48,997
- What does that mean?
- It's too hot.

594
00:55:51,217 --> 00:55:52,523
Bodega.

595
00:56:00,182 --> 00:56:01,270
Cover up.

596
00:56:10,105 --> 00:56:12,280
I don't care what you hear
or what you see,

597
00:56:12,281 --> 00:56:14,849
do not look up,
do not drop that tarp. Okay?

598
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:16,721
My count.

599
00:56:19,245 --> 00:56:21,682
One, two, go!

600
00:56:36,305 --> 00:56:37,871
It's like a dinner bell.

601
00:56:37,872 --> 00:56:40,397
We need to shut it off.

602
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,719
-We good?
- It's close.

603
00:58:33,335 --> 00:58:35,250
You remember
when a full moon meant...

604
00:58:36,817 --> 00:58:39,167
...something cool and magical?

605
00:58:43,563 --> 00:58:46,523
God, we gotta find a way
back to that again.

606
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:50,483
It's the only way
to go on with life.

607
00:58:53,225 --> 00:58:56,314
I don't even know
what that looks like anymore.

608
00:58:56,315 --> 00:58:58,622
"Go on with life."

609
00:59:00,667 --> 00:59:03,016
You know, I've been around
this planet five times over

610
00:59:03,017 --> 00:59:04,541
chasing pandemics?

611
00:59:08,414 --> 00:59:10,895
I never had time for a family.
I didn't want one.

612
00:59:13,071 --> 00:59:14,376
Give me a crisis...

613
00:59:15,813 --> 00:59:17,075
I can handle that.

614
00:59:22,167 --> 00:59:23,820
Now I have my brother's family,

615
00:59:23,821 --> 00:59:25,474
and I don't know
how to take care of 'em.

616
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,304
You're giving them your best.

617
00:59:31,916 --> 00:59:33,873
That's the problem.

618
00:59:33,874 --> 00:59:36,355
I don't think
my best is good enough.

619
00:59:40,315 --> 00:59:42,274
It's ready.

620
00:59:43,667 --> 00:59:45,319
All right.

621
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:48,280
We just need to find
something to keep it cold.

622
00:59:50,325 --> 00:59:52,066
- I'll go check the back.
- Mm.

623
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:25,839
Hey.

624
01:00:27,232 --> 01:00:30,670
Hey. How did you get in here?

625
01:00:37,372 --> 01:00:38,896
Oh, fuck.

626
01:00:43,291 --> 01:00:44,641
Stop.

627
01:00:48,427 --> 01:00:49,471
Stop.

628
01:00:52,474 --> 01:00:53,780
I'm not gonna tell you again.

629
01:00:54,781 --> 01:00:56,391
Don't make me shoot you.

630
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:58,785
Stop!

631
01:01:04,443 --> 01:01:05,749
Jesus.

632
01:01:07,098 --> 01:01:08,185
I almost...

633
01:01:10,623 --> 01:01:11,885
Just a kid.

634
01:01:13,321 --> 01:01:14,409
I know.

635
01:01:17,325 --> 01:01:19,458
Let's get out of here.

636
01:01:47,007 --> 01:01:48,705
Stay here, baby.

637
01:02:06,113 --> 01:02:08,811
My home is a sacred ground.

638
01:02:08,812 --> 01:02:12,902
I will protect myself and
the ones I love at all costs.

639
01:02:12,903 --> 01:02:15,034
I am a survivor.

640
01:02:15,035 --> 01:02:17,777
I am strong. I am capable.

641
01:02:18,778 --> 01:02:21,389
I bend, but I do not break.

642
01:02:27,613 --> 01:02:31,660
Cody Walker, get the hell
off my property!

643
01:02:33,967 --> 01:02:36,403
You hear that?

644
01:02:36,404 --> 01:02:38,057
That's a 12-gauge shotgun,

645
01:02:38,058 --> 01:02:40,103
and I swear to God,
I'll blow your fucking head off.

646
01:02:40,104 --> 01:02:41,975
Yeah!

647
01:02:44,282 --> 01:02:45,413
Come here.

648
01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:04,998
I'm here.

649
01:03:15,617 --> 01:03:16,662
Oh, shit.

650
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:34,722
Goddamn it!

651
01:03:34,723 --> 01:03:37,639
Come on. Come on. Stay with me.

652
01:04:05,276 --> 01:04:07,452
Emma, get over here.

653
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:15,852
Damn it.

654
01:04:21,466 --> 01:04:22,684
Light this up
like we practiced, okay?

655
01:04:42,791 --> 01:04:44,967
Where are you?
I am not gonna warn you again.

656
01:04:44,968 --> 01:04:46,490
You leave now,
or I will shoot anyone

657
01:04:46,491 --> 01:04:48,840
that tries
to get inside my house.

658
01:05:00,505 --> 01:05:04,029
Fuck.

659
01:05:14,432 --> 01:05:17,217
Nails... it'll hold them.

660
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:24,355
Hot, down.

661
01:05:28,315 --> 01:05:30,099
-Check your six!
-On it.

662
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:31,535
Move.

663
01:05:31,536 --> 01:05:32,884
Got one coming from northbound.

664
01:05:32,885 --> 01:05:34,190
Shoot, motherfucker, shoot!

665
01:05:34,191 --> 01:05:36,062
Good. Looks good.

666
01:05:44,636 --> 01:05:45,898
Move in!

667
01:05:48,379 --> 01:05:51,556
-On your left!
-He's running! Get him!

668
01:05:55,212 --> 01:05:56,647
Yeah!

669
01:06:07,093 --> 01:06:08,573
Move up! Move up!

670
01:06:11,054 --> 01:06:13,359
- Who are these guys?
-Get him now!

671
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:15,623
I don't know, but they're gonna
get us the hell out of here.

672
01:06:18,583 --> 01:06:20,149
Forward!

673
01:06:26,330 --> 01:06:28,853
Ceasefire. Ceasefire.

674
01:06:28,854 --> 01:06:30,942
Yeah, boys, they're gone.

675
01:06:30,943 --> 01:06:32,422
Got 'em on the run.

676
01:06:32,423 --> 01:06:33,858
Think we got 'em.

677
01:06:33,859 --> 01:06:34,946
Yeah, motherfucker.

678
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:37,601
Good shooting, men.

679
01:06:37,602 --> 01:06:38,906
- Hey!
- Stay right there!

680
01:06:38,907 --> 01:06:40,865
-Hey!
-Don't move.

681
01:06:40,866 --> 01:06:42,693
- No, no, no! We're friendlies.
- Don't move, motherfucker!

682
01:06:42,694 --> 01:06:44,434
Don't shoot.

683
01:06:44,435 --> 01:06:46,436
Did you hear? Don't move!

684
01:06:46,437 --> 01:06:47,785
-We're the CDC.
- We're friendlies.

685
01:06:47,786 --> 01:06:49,047
- We're with the CDC.
- Don't shoot!

686
01:06:49,048 --> 01:06:50,831
Stop talking.

687
01:06:50,832 --> 01:06:52,659
- Look, look. We're not turning.
- No, we're protected!

688
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:54,400
Look, look, look, look. We're
protected. -We're protected.

689
01:06:54,401 --> 01:06:57,012
- It blocks the light. It works.
- That's bullshit, man!

690
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:58,448
- No, we're friendlies.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

691
01:06:58,449 --> 01:07:00,406
Don't shoot.

692
01:07:00,407 --> 01:07:01,581
Fuck!

693
01:07:04,107 --> 01:07:05,325
Go forward.

694
01:08:05,733 --> 01:08:07,648
Mommy!

695
01:08:13,828 --> 01:08:15,743
Fuck.

696
01:08:24,665 --> 01:08:25,884
Four left.

697
01:08:49,081 --> 01:08:50,603
They're forming a kill circle.

698
01:08:50,604 --> 01:08:52,257
If we stay here,
we're gonna die.

699
01:08:54,608 --> 01:08:57,480
We get to the Bronco.
It's our only shot.

700
01:08:57,481 --> 01:09:00,831
You get to that gun,
I'll be a distraction.

701
01:09:00,832 --> 01:09:02,833
- What?
- I have a theory.

702
01:09:02,834 --> 01:09:04,356
I'm going to test it.

703
01:09:04,357 --> 01:09:06,967
- No.
- You want to get to Lucy?

704
01:09:06,968 --> 01:09:08,361
Trust me.

705
01:09:09,841 --> 01:09:11,147
Don't die.

706
01:09:12,322 --> 01:09:14,105
Go.

707
01:09:14,106 --> 01:09:15,324
Hey!

708
01:09:16,935 --> 01:09:18,415
Hey, you forgot one!

709
01:09:19,416 --> 01:09:20,852
Look at me.

710
01:10:04,374 --> 01:10:05,418
Hey!

711
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:09,335
Bite me.

712
01:10:31,488 --> 01:10:33,532
Amy! Now!

713
01:10:42,368 --> 01:10:43,630
Come on, come on, come on!

714
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:50,028
No! No!

715
01:11:26,891 --> 01:11:29,806
Come on. Come on!

716
01:11:29,807 --> 01:11:32,287
I will kill every one
of you motherfuckers!

717
01:11:43,603 --> 01:11:44,996
Get behind the couch.

718
01:12:25,776 --> 01:12:26,820
Fuck!

719
01:12:36,656 --> 01:12:37,962
Emma.

720
01:12:40,791 --> 01:12:42,835
They're gonna get in, okay?

721
01:12:42,836 --> 01:12:46,404
If you see something,
you point and you spray.

722
01:12:46,405 --> 01:12:47,579
Can you do that?

723
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:49,668
- I'm scared, Mom.
- I know.

724
01:12:49,669 --> 01:12:53,672
I know, but you're brave, too.
You point and you spray.

725
01:12:53,673 --> 01:12:54,761
Mm.

726
01:14:16,147 --> 01:14:18,844
All right,
you hairy motherfuckers.

727
01:14:18,845 --> 01:14:21,020
Come fetch.

728
01:14:38,169 --> 01:14:40,345
Whoo! You motherfucker!

729
01:14:48,788 --> 01:14:50,660
Oh, shit.

730
01:14:51,878 --> 01:14:53,227
Motherfucker.

731
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:38,055
It's okay. It's over, okay?

732
01:15:45,671 --> 01:15:47,020
Here.

733
01:17:06,709 --> 01:17:09,450
Lucy? Emma?

734
01:17:12,018 --> 01:17:15,152
Lucy? Emma?

735
01:17:31,516 --> 01:17:33,038
Hey. Come here.

736
01:17:33,039 --> 01:17:35,954
Uncle Wes, I missed you so much.

737
01:17:35,955 --> 01:17:37,914
You okay?

738
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:40,525
Come on.

739
01:17:41,874 --> 01:17:45,050
- What happened at the lab?
- It's a long story.

740
01:17:45,051 --> 01:17:46,356
I should have never left.

741
01:17:46,357 --> 01:17:50,360
Are you... are you okay?
Let me see.

742
01:17:50,361 --> 01:17:53,406
Yeah, yeah. It's not my blood.
Most of it anyway. We're good.

743
01:17:53,407 --> 01:17:55,582
Okay. Okay. We're okay.

744
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:57,410
We're okay.
It's gonna be daylight soon.

745
01:17:57,411 --> 01:17:59,325
Just go get me the shotgun.

746
01:17:59,326 --> 01:18:01,110
No more shells.

747
01:18:01,111 --> 01:18:02,938
No more shells? What did you do?

748
01:18:02,939 --> 01:18:05,071
It's been a busy night.

749
01:18:07,508 --> 01:18:08,945
He's not dead.

750
01:18:10,816 --> 01:18:12,252
Go.

751
01:18:25,744 --> 01:18:27,354
What are we gonna do?

752
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:55,339
It's okay.

753
01:18:56,427 --> 01:18:58,124
Come over here.

754
01:19:02,563 --> 01:19:04,391
I want you to make me a promise.

755
01:19:06,132 --> 01:19:08,307
No matter what happens,

756
01:19:08,308 --> 01:19:12,703
when you grow up,
I want you to be brave,

757
01:19:12,704 --> 01:19:16,576
and I want you to be strong,
just like your daddy.

758
01:19:16,577 --> 01:19:19,188
Okay? You know why?

759
01:19:19,189 --> 01:19:22,322
Because you have a heart
just like your daddy.

760
01:19:23,541 --> 01:19:24,847
You promise me?

761
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:28,372
Good girl.

762
01:19:29,329 --> 01:19:30,678
What's going on?

763
01:19:33,159 --> 01:19:34,681
This house isn't gonna
last much longer.

764
01:19:34,682 --> 01:19:37,075
Wait. What are you
talking about?

765
01:19:37,076 --> 01:19:39,643
No, no, no, no.
You can't go out there. Look,

766
01:19:39,644 --> 01:19:41,688
we-we can stick together.
We can fight this. We...

767
01:19:41,689 --> 01:19:44,953
If we wait it out until sunrise,
we can survive this.

768
01:19:44,954 --> 01:19:48,695
This watch is set for sunrise.
You have 15 minutes.

769
01:20:04,930 --> 01:20:07,150
Always ready.

770
01:20:08,151 --> 01:20:09,195
No, Wes.

771
01:20:11,067 --> 01:20:12,982
I love you guys.

772
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:42,272
I never liked you, Cody.

773
01:20:45,710 --> 01:20:47,885
And I'm gonna fucking bury you.

774
01:22:55,883 --> 01:22:57,885
Come on. Come on, come on.

775
01:22:59,235 --> 01:23:01,671
Is Uncle Wes okay?
What's going on?

776
01:23:01,672 --> 01:23:03,413
Look, this is what
we're gonna do, okay?

777
01:23:05,197 --> 01:23:07,242
You're gonna hide in here
with your eyes closed.

778
01:23:07,243 --> 01:23:11,115
No matter what you hear,
you do not come out.

779
01:23:11,116 --> 01:23:13,684
- You do not make a sound.
- Okay.

780
01:23:16,730 --> 01:23:17,992
Get in, get in, get in.

781
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:19,515
Listen, listen...

782
01:23:19,516 --> 01:23:22,300
if something happens, okay,

783
01:23:22,301 --> 01:23:24,737
I want you to wait
until you hear sirens,

784
01:23:24,738 --> 01:23:27,785
and then you run to the
neighbors for help, okay? Okay.

785
01:23:30,135 --> 01:23:31,701
I love you.

786
01:23:31,702 --> 01:23:33,573
-  I love you, too, Mom.
- Okay.

787
01:24:24,798 --> 01:24:28,105
Wes... Wesley!
Wesley, please. Please.

788
01:24:28,106 --> 01:24:30,848
Please, I know you can hear me.
I know you can hear me.

789
01:24:33,938 --> 01:24:35,244
Please don't do this.

790
01:24:47,734 --> 01:24:49,474
Oh, God.

791
01:25:06,013 --> 01:25:07,841
No...

792
01:25:09,016 --> 01:25:10,105
Wes!

793
01:25:13,282 --> 01:25:15,631
Wes, Wes, we're your...

794
01:25:15,632 --> 01:25:18,373
we're your family,
and we love you. We...

795
01:25:18,374 --> 01:25:20,680
Please don't do this
to us. Please.

796
01:25:21,290 --> 01:25:22,552
Oh, God!

797
01:25:44,139 --> 01:25:45,531
Oh. Oh, God!

798
01:25:47,664 --> 01:25:49,360
Think of your...
think of your brother.

799
01:25:49,361 --> 01:25:51,275
Think of Sean.

800
01:25:55,193 --> 01:25:57,804
Remember...
remember your brother, Sean.

801
01:25:59,850 --> 01:26:03,113
Think of... think of Emma.
Think of Emma, your niece.

802
01:26:03,114 --> 01:26:05,115
Think of how much you love her.

803
01:26:05,116 --> 01:26:06,899
And we love you so much.

804
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:10,207
Wes, it's me.

805
01:26:10,208 --> 01:26:12,427
It's Sean.

806
01:26:21,088 --> 01:26:23,265
I'm sorry.

807
01:26:34,101 --> 01:26:35,319
Always ready.

3
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,082
Okay. You have to get out
by yourself, okay?

4
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:26,707
- No! I don't want to!
- Relax.

5
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:27,958
- Everything's fine.
- No!

6
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:47,750
SWIM TO ME

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,916
Let's go!

8
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,833
Okay, Julia, let's go.

9
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:53,333
Swim this way.

10
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,166
Let's go.

11
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:01,833
Legs like tree trunks.
Don't bend your knees, Julia.

12
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,249
Legs outstretched.

13
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,458
Kick hard.

14
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:13,833
Give me your hand.

15
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:15,500
Okay, come here.

16
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:17,250
Come here.

17
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:20,124
All right, let's go.

18
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:21,832
- No.
- One more time. Ready?

19
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:24,625
- No.
- Don't worry. I learned the same way.

20
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:39,958
Give me your hand. Come here.

21
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:44,000
See? I told you it's fine.

22
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:47,291
Come on, Cristóbal. Leave her alone.

23
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:50,333
Shall we?

24
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:28,625
Estela.

25
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:31,916
Estela!

26
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,541
Estela, are you there?

27
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:40,165
She's not trapped. She's clinging.

28
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:41,999
Julia, it's not funny.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,916
Julia.

30
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:46,000
It's not funny at all. Enough.

31
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,375
I'm tired.

32
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,582
Come on. Oh, sweetie!

33
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:52,708
Julia, enough.

34
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,124
Stop. I have to work.

35
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,374
I'm tired.

36
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,832
- Estela can braid your hair, sweetie.
- Hello?

37
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:02,000
Please connect me to Pediatrics
on the fourth floor.

38
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,624
Yes. A seven-year-old girl.

39
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,458
A scoliosis patient.

40
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:11,208
I was told she had a slight fever.

41
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:17,499
Okay. Let's get a referral
from Infectious Diseases, please.

42
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,375
Shall we go clean our ears
with cotton swabs?

43
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,416
You don't want cotton swabs.

44
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,541
Then put up with it.

45
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,208
- All that should get thrown away.
- Okay.

46
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,583
- All that there. That box too.
- Yeah.

47
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,708
He still hasn't thrown away
his mom's clothes.

48
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:45,541
Look!

49
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:49,291
Look what I found. The swimming cap.

50
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,958
Sweetie, I promise I'll buy you a new one.

51
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,416
Hey, Chinita.

52
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:57,833
Look at me.

53
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,832
I wanted to go with you,
but I won't be able to.

54
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:01,874
Okay?

55
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,415
- But Estela will go with you.
- I'm on vacation.

56
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,333
Can I start another day?

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,875
No. There was only one spot left,
and I had to run to reserve it.

58
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:12,958
Put it on her, okay?

59
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:14,791
Chinita, look at me.

60
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,540
At Caburgua Lake,
the two of us will practice together.

61
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,540
How much longer until we go?

62
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,624
Besides, you need to go out,
have a good time, learn things.

63
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:25,375
You can't spend all day
cooped up in the house with Estela.

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,875
It's my turn to sit down.

65
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:46,833
No.

66
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,416
- See you later.
- Bye!

67
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,165
Yes?

68
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,583
I'm here with her.

69
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,166
Okay, Mom.

70
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,250
If you want to dunk them...

71
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:08,708
We blow...

72
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:14,290
And when the child goes...
closes their eyes,

73
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,500
we dunk them and lift them out.

74
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,832
Okay?

75
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,541
That's it. Good.

76
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:25,791
It hurts.

77
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,874
It hurts!

78
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,582
Hey... this water is full of lice.

79
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,999
Who's going to get them off you later? Me?

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,041
No.

81
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,457
If you put it over the back first,
it's much easier.

82
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:42,375
Vicente.

83
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:43,957
Let's see.

84
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:44,915
Faster.

85
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:47,833
Everyone follow Miss Natalia. Okay?

86
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:52,207
That way, over there.
No running, okay? Take it easy.

87
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,415
Moms and Dads,
I invite you to go to the cafeteria.

88
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:57,165
- You can have breakfast.
- Go on.

89
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:58,416
Everything okay, Julia?

90
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,999
Take your time. At your own pace.

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,291
Whenever you want.

92
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:05,875
Okay.

93
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,332
<i>Okay, kids, let's go in the water?</i>

94
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,457
Come on, Julia.

95
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,582
You go first.

96
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,958
But, hey...

97
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:19,583
Okay. Everybody else, into the water.
C'mon, kids!

98
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:21,958
What happened?

99
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:26,625
You don't want to go in the water?
Let's go together. Come with me.

100
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,666
Everybody's in the water,
all your friends.

101
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,665
It's all right. You're gonna learn, okay?

102
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:35,040
Come on. Let's jump in together.

103
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,791
On the count of three. One, two, three!

104
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,416
Ma'am? Excuse me. You can't come in here.

105
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,791
Ma'am, no...

106
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,541
On the count of one...

107
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:01,207
Julia, are you okay? Do you want to leave?

108
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,000
Shall we? Let's go.

109
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,541
But, hey...

110
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,333
She has to stay
until the end of the class.

111
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:12,000
We came for nothing.

112
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,000
Does that seem right to you?

113
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:20,083
Now you'll have to come with me
on some errands.

114
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,750
What will you tell your parents?

115
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,666
That I don't want to swim.

116
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,958
But you have to learn, Julia,
sooner or later.

117
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:38,750
Where did you learn to swim?

118
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:41,958
Did they force you?

119
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,707
So dramatic about everything.

120
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,707
I'll teach you how to swim.

121
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,458
End of story.

122
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,333
What about the ice cream?

123
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,833
You didn't even put a toe in the water.

124
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,125
Okay, let's go.

125
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,291
<i>Stay here, Julia.</i>

126
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:11,707
Hi.

127
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:15,582
- Good afternoon.
- For María Rosa Torres.

128
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,290
Perfect.

129
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:20,790
She can withdraw it as of tomorrow
at the Castro branch.

130
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,290
- She must give the number on the ticket.
- Okay.

131
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,708
- Ma'am!
- Huh?

132
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,291
Your ticket.

133
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,416
- Next. Good afternoon.
- How are you?

134
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,125
Julia!

135
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,541
What did I say about wandering off?

136
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:47,875
Let's go!

137
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:49,375
Let's go!

138
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:52,791
Let's go!

139
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,083
Last one.

140
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Shall we?

141
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,875
I'll buy you something.

142
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,500
One thing.

143
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,415
Something useful.

144
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:26,000
Put that back. I said one thing.

145
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:53,166
The blue one for me
and the pink one for you.

146
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,958
- I don't like pink.
- Neither do I.

147
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,833
<i>The first classes are always like this.</i>

148
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,290
They're always difficult.

149
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,666
Horrible.

150
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,625
Well, but you'll have to get used to it.

151
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:51,916
That's it.

152
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,875
What happened, Estela?

153
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:57,499
The water was very cold.

154
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,207
The teacher had too many students.

155
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,790
It could be dangerous.

156
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,416
That club is more rundown every day.

157
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,208
They told me there would be
maximum five kids per class.

158
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,874
There were lots more. Like 43 or more.

159
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:15,208
Sweetie, by the time we're at the lake,
you'll be swimming.

160
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,540
<i>If the children don't have the confidence
to enter the water,</i>

161
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:23,332
<i>it's better to do so at a depth
that allows them to touch the floor.</i>

162
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:26,749
<i>The best exercises to learn to swim</i>

163
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:30,125
<i>are to put one's head under
and exhale through...</i>

164
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,207
It's a video call, Mom.
I can only see your hair.

165
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,625
Turn the camera around.

166
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:39,833
<i>Look. See?</i>

167
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:43,958
You can't eat vegetables here.
They taste like nothing.

168
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,583
That's so nice.

169
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,499
Have the bus tickets gone up yet?

170
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,749
<i>Hey, don't buy them for the holidays,</i>

171
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,625
<i>because they get too expensive.</i>

172
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:03,625
<i>Why would you come for so few days?</i>

173
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,499
<i>What for, I say?</i>

174
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,666
Sonia started working at the salmon farm.

175
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:10,499
She says it's not bad.

176
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,250
<i>Forget it. You're good there.</i>

177
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,540
<i>Your cousin gets paid next to nothing,
if at all.</i>

178
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:19,332
<i>Plus, they poison those poor creatures.</i>

179
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:22,082
<i>Then they get sick... and die.</i>

180
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,832
<i>...and four criminals entered.</i>

181
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,540
<i>Based on how they looked,</i>

182
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:28,457
<i>and how they moved, I think...</i>

183
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,583
The store I shop at was robbed.

184
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,250
<i>You get used to everything.</i>

185
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,582
<i>They'll kill you for a cell phone.</i>

186
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:38,166
<i>They break into houses at night.</i>

187
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,333
<i>That's who we are.</i>

188
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:42,750
That's not who we are, Mom.

189
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,000
Juanita!

190
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:52,458
Borja!

191
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,375
Come here!

192
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,833
Kids, time to go home!

193
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,249
- Hi, Estela.
- Estela, look!

194
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,582
Can we get in?

195
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,499
- Let's see.
- Where'd these pirates come from?

196
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,874
Borja always goes up first.

197
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,874
Okay, easy. Slow down.

198
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,665
We'll be here, Estela, look.

199
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,957
Two weeks at Caburgua Lake.

200
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,250
Yes, but it's baby-sized.

201
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,416
- Like it, guys?
- This is the way down.

202
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:23,166
Come on. That's it!

203
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:28,082
One, two, three,

204
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:31,457
four, five, six,

205
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:34,000
seven, eight...

206
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,000
Rest.

207
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,583
At least I'm getting better.

208
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,750
- Better than nothing.
- What do you mean, "better than nothing"?

209
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,500
Better than nothing.

210
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,208
Five times ten...

211
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:04,666
Five... like ten times five...

212
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:09,208
Twelve, like thirteen...

213
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,124
Twelve or thirteen hours...

214
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,208
Yes.

215
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:18,625
You make me last more and more.

216
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,375
Okay, we just have to heat this stuff up.

217
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,458
It heats up, and then it'll work.

218
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,375
Feel anything?

219
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:03,750
Yes.

220
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,166
Smile. You're not being filmed.

221
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:27,207
Are you new?

222
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,958
No, I'm already 40.

223
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,458
Not that new and not that promising.

224
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:37,083
Just kidding. I just started last week.

225
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:39,791
A red one, please.

226
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,458
He doesn't like when people spend money.

227
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,666
He's an austere dog.

228
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,083
You work around here?

229
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,083
Me too.

230
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,291
I mean, if you come by again,
we may see each other or something.

231
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,582
I have plenty of time.

232
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:05,708
My pleasure.

233
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,208
Go home.

234
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,750
Hey, slow down.

235
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,875
You're supposed to enjoy the food.

236
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:59,458
You filthy damn mutt.

237
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:02,750
No barking here.

238
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:04,875
Shoo!

239
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:10,833
Shoo! Shoo!

240
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,457
<i>Oh, Estela, I'm exhausted.</i>

241
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,458
<i>I'd be happy to skip this opening.</i>

242
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,875
Mara, it's your friend's event.

243
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,625
You rushed me.

244
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,874
It's 7:30, and it says
it takes 47 minutes to get there.

245
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,416
Plus time to park.

246
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:34,415
Julia, stand up, please. You have feet.

247
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,708
Stop crawling.

248
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:37,915
If she doesn't eat, no TV.

249
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,000
Okay.

250
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:41,375
Curator?

251
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,041
Or artist?

252
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:49,333
That one.

253
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:50,666
Okay.

254
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,333
Julia.

255
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:07,291
Julia.

256
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:12,458
Julia.

257
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:40,458
When I move, she keeps looking at me.

258
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,207
Okay. She can't look at you now.

259
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,250
Upside down, she can't go anywhere.

260
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,041
Okay, go to sleep.

261
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:05,750
Okay.

262
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:07,916
Get some rest.

263
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,916
What is it, Sonia? I can't talk.

264
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:39,832
<i>Hold on. Your mom.</i>

265
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,041
What happened?

266
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,165
<i>I don't know exactly
what happened to her, but...</i>

267
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,207
<i>I mean, I couldn't talk to her.</i>

268
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,999
<i>- But she had a fracture.</i>
- Where is she?

269
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,791
<i>They sat her up, and they shouldn't have.</i>

270
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:52,833
And...?

271
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:56,291
- Who saw her? Did you talk to her?
<i>- I didn't see her.</i>

272
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,707
<i>- The neighbor.</i>
- And did you see how she was?

273
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:01,374
<i>- No, she found her on the ground.</i>
- Were you there or...?

274
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,749
Did you touch her? What did she break?

275
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,249
<i>She grabbed a branch, the branch broke,</i>

276
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,791
<i>she fell out of the chair,
and broke her hip.</i>

277
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,333
<i>She's in the hospital for surgery.</i>

278
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,874
And can you stay with her
until I get there?

279
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,624
<i>Yes, I'll be with her. Don't worry.</i>

280
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:19,457
<i>- I mean, until you come.</i>
- I'll have a talk here and sort it out.

281
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:20,458
<i>Okay.</i>

282
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,375
What's fun about smoking?

283
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,125
What are you doing here?

284
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,416
No, no. Go to bed.

285
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,625
No minors allowed in here.

286
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:01,041
Your parents don't like
you to come in this room.

287
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:03,500
I'm scared.

288
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,583
There's still things above the ceiling.

289
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:08,625
They're called stars.

290
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:10,540
I mean it.

291
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:13,000
They're mice running around
in the ceiling.

292
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,000
Not even one cigarette in peace.

293
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:29,082
<i>...they're called antlers, not horns,
because they grow them out over and over.</i>

294
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,541
Close your eyes.

295
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,166
Only owls don't sleep.

296
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:49,541
When I was your age,
I slept completely still.

297
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:52,291
Like a mummy.

298
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:59,291
My mom and I had to share the bed.

299
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:05,458
Today, she fell and she was alone.

300
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:11,541
That's how she is.

301
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,250
You never know.

302
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:24,000
She says she doesn't want me to go,

303
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:27,041
but she does.

304
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:54,458
Hey, you!

305
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:58,000
Hey!

306
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:46,416
Are you older than my mom?

307
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:49,040
We're about the same.

308
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:50,541
Are you going to die when she does?

309
00:24:52,541 --> 00:24:54,833
First, my grandma died.

310
00:24:55,625 --> 00:24:56,875
Nena.

311
00:24:57,375 --> 00:25:02,374
Then, my dad's going to die,

312
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:05,708
then my mom or you, and then me.

313
00:25:06,291 --> 00:25:07,208
No.

314
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:11,541
Unbearable girls live a long time.

315
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,625
Only the good die young.

316
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:28,415
Cristóbal.

317
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:29,375
What?

318
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:32,249
Estela needs to talk to us.

319
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,499
About what?

320
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,166
I guess her mom's issue is serious.

321
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:38,582
Your mom is having surgery?

322
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:39,583
Yes.

323
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:42,499
Will you have to travel, Estela?

324
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,666
Yes. She's supposed to get
a hip replacement tomorrow.

325
00:25:47,666 --> 00:25:50,583
Well, hip replacements are
a routine surgery nowadays.

326
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:55,375
Complications are extremely rare. So...

327
00:25:57,291 --> 00:25:58,624
I can't, Cristóbal.

328
00:25:58,625 --> 00:26:01,665
I have to spend all day in the workshop
to wrap a ton of pieces.

329
00:26:01,666 --> 00:26:04,125
I have to deliver on Monday. I can't.

330
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:06,041
Yes, I know.

331
00:26:07,291 --> 00:26:11,333
Estela, what if we pay for a flight
and you travel on Monday?

332
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:13,166
That might be better.

333
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,790
Look, if you go now,
they won't even let you in.

334
00:26:18,791 --> 00:26:19,707
That's true.

335
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:21,916
I think it's better
to get there for the post-op.

336
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:27,666
That way, you'll be there
for the follow-ups, aftercare...

337
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:05,166
Leave my drawer alone.

338
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:16,791
She's in surgery right now.

339
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:37,540
<i>Hi, Estela.</i>

340
00:27:37,541 --> 00:27:39,374
<i>She just woke up from the anesthesia.</i>

341
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:42,666
<i>She woke up a little sad,
but they say that's normal.</i>

342
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:47,583
Is she okay?

343
00:27:50,416 --> 00:27:52,749
I WANT TO DRINK FROM YOUR LIPS

344
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:57,375
TO QUENCH MY SOUL'S THIRST

345
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:09,791
What's this?

346
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:15,125
It's something that brings you luck,
that protects you.

347
00:28:17,166 --> 00:28:18,416
For what?

348
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:22,457
It's an amulet
to keep you from falling in love.

349
00:28:22,458 --> 00:28:24,625
Why not fall in love?

350
00:28:26,666 --> 00:28:28,041
To not have a bad time.

351
00:28:40,208 --> 00:28:42,583
It's nice. Will you give it to me?

352
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:46,333
No, it's mine.

353
00:28:57,291 --> 00:28:59,749
You talk to the kids, okay?

354
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,291
I'm not in the mood.

355
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,625
No, leave it!

356
00:29:08,541 --> 00:29:09,583
No!

357
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,625
- Stop!
- Okay, stop. You two have to stop.

358
00:29:14,625 --> 00:29:16,040
No, no, no.

359
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:17,708
I want another sheet.

360
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:21,500
I want them to leave.

361
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,583
I heard you.

362
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:27,333
Julia.

363
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:29,791
You can't lock yourself in again.

364
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:46,041
Are you going back to your mom's?

365
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:52,333
If I go, who will take care of you?

366
00:29:55,666 --> 00:29:56,583
Want to get up?

367
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:02,415
<i>Oh, your brother called me this morning.</i>

368
00:30:02,416 --> 00:30:03,750
He showed up?

369
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,999
<i>Don't start.</i>

370
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,457
<i>You two are even.</i>

371
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:09,416
No, Mom, I didn't disappear.

372
00:30:09,916 --> 00:30:11,207
I came here for work.

373
00:30:11,208 --> 00:30:14,958
And I'll visit as soon
as Sonia runs out of days off,

374
00:30:15,458 --> 00:30:17,374
so that we take turns providing care.

375
00:30:17,375 --> 00:30:19,666
<i>I already told you, I'm fine now.</i>

376
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:22,708
<i>Save those days for vacation.</i>

377
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,541
Okay, Mom.

378
00:30:28,666 --> 00:30:29,833
Let's talk tomorrow.

379
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:31,625
Kisses. Bye.

380
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:57,000
Look what she brought you!

381
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,666
- Look, dog.
- He asks about you every day.

382
00:32:01,791 --> 00:32:03,375
But we don't know your name.

383
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:07,125
Estela.

384
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:10,416
Carlos. Nice to meet you.

385
00:32:14,041 --> 00:32:15,500
Does he break into your house too?

386
00:32:17,083 --> 00:32:18,708
Yes, but it's not my house.

387
00:32:22,416 --> 00:32:23,791
Quite the beggar, huh?

388
00:32:24,416 --> 00:32:26,000
Going from house to house.

389
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:34,374
Where are you from?

390
00:32:34,375 --> 00:32:35,624
Chiloé.

391
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:36,750
Chiloé!

392
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:38,625
How is it?

393
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,500
More trees than people.

394
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:46,958
Maple, oak, elm, myrtle,

395
00:32:47,708 --> 00:32:48,625
laurel.

396
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:50,749
And you, where do you live?

397
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:51,708
Here.

398
00:32:52,208 --> 00:32:54,333
I'm taking care
of a friend's house around here.

399
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:56,208
For a few months.

400
00:32:58,041 --> 00:32:59,207
Just a moment.

401
00:32:59,208 --> 00:33:00,250
Here, here.

402
00:33:02,916 --> 00:33:06,332
<i>When I moved to Santiago,
I thought the air smelled like dust,</i>

403
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:08,999
that it was very hot,
and that everything was two colors,

404
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,250
yellow or brown.

405
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:12,457
Yellow trees, brown hills.

406
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:15,416
Yellow buildings, brown squares.

407
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:21,665
Hey, what are you doing? No, don't.

408
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,500
If they see you smoking, they'll fire me.

409
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,708
How could they fire you? Where would
they get a replacement this time of year?

410
00:33:37,125 --> 00:33:38,166
"Hey, boss."

411
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,250
"Are we going to work
on the Day of the Dead?"

412
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:43,166
Is this a joke?

413
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:46,458
"What, are you dead? No?"

414
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:47,875
"Then what?"

415
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:49,791
"Off to work with you!"

416
00:33:53,625 --> 00:33:54,666
Not funny.

417
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:08,375
- I'm the nanny.
- Take those off.

418
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:10,041
Take them off now.

419
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:11,833
Take them off, Julia!

420
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:14,125
Take them off!

421
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:19,125
Come on, Julia, take them off.

422
00:34:23,791 --> 00:34:26,082
One, two, three, down.

423
00:34:26,083 --> 00:34:34,915
One, two, three, up.
One, two, three, down.

424
00:34:34,916 --> 00:34:36,915
That's it.
Puff up your chest like a pigeon.

425
00:34:36,916 --> 00:34:38,916
Pigeons don't swim.

426
00:34:40,666 --> 00:34:42,415
I've been here for like an hour.

427
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:44,541
Can I have a break?

428
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,540
You're so stubborn
to be already up and about, Mom.

429
00:34:52,541 --> 00:34:55,874
<i>Yes, I'm going right back to bed.
I was just feeding the cat.</i>

430
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:57,249
Merry Christmas, Mom.

431
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:59,750
<i>- Are you doing anything there tonight?</i>
- Estela!

432
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:05,165
Mommy, I'm hanging up now.
I'll call you later. Okay?

433
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:06,166
<i>Bye.</i>

434
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:21,332
<i>- Hi. Good evening. Did something happen?
- Good evening.</i>

435
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:24,332
Were you the one who saw the guy
lurking around? Did you call?

436
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:26,499
No, I don't even know the number to call.

437
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,915
Everyone's asleep here.

438
00:35:27,916 --> 00:35:29,124
It's 18-18.

439
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:30,750
18-18. Thank you.

440
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:33,040
I'll check across the street.

441
00:35:33,041 --> 00:35:34,250
COMMUNITY PATROL

442
00:35:59,333 --> 00:36:05,749
- Open it!
- Open it!

443
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:08,041
- Let's see. What is it?
- Ta-da!

444
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:10,790
- What is it?
- Look how pretty!

445
00:36:10,791 --> 00:36:12,332
- What is it?
- It's a parrot!

446
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:15,540
- A parrot. Look, it's got something here.
- No, look.

447
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:16,832
- What's that?
- There, sweetie.

448
00:36:16,833 --> 00:36:19,208
- There, let's see, look.
- Jingle bells.

449
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
<i>Jingle bells.</i>

450
00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:24,458
Santa is dumb.

451
00:36:26,166 --> 00:36:27,750
<i>Santa is dumb.</i>

452
00:36:29,791 --> 00:36:31,166
Say something.

453
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:33,665
Julia is pretty.

454
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:35,583
<i>Julia is pretty.</i>

455
00:36:37,625 --> 00:36:38,582
You like it?

456
00:36:38,583 --> 00:36:40,249
Okay. Estela.

457
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,583
Estela's gift.

458
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:44,374
- This is embarrassing!
- What could it be?

459
00:36:44,375 --> 00:36:46,665
Thank you very much.

460
00:36:46,666 --> 00:36:50,083
Open it. Open it.

461
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,999
Look, a towel. How nice.

462
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,457
It's got a gift receipt.

463
00:36:55,458 --> 00:36:58,249
- If it doesn't fit, or to exchange it.
- A swimsuit!

464
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:00,041
It's perfect for Caburgua.

465
00:37:00,541 --> 00:37:02,415
Look, what a beautiful color.

466
00:37:02,416 --> 00:37:03,374
Thank you.

467
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:06,124
You know I wouldn't go in the lake
even if you dragged me, though.

468
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:09,374
Okay, I'm heading out now.
Otherwise, I'll hit traffic. Okay?

469
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:10,540
Good.

470
00:37:10,541 --> 00:37:12,082
Estela, go with him.

471
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:14,249
Last time I had him get a cake,
it got there in pieces.

472
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:16,250
- Hello.
<i>- Hello.</i>

473
00:37:35,583 --> 00:37:42,125
<i>I want to find my path in your open hands</i>

474
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:49,458
<i>And for you to feel like a woman
Only when you're with me</i>

475
00:37:50,083 --> 00:37:53,250
- What's this slum tune?
<i>- I feel like having you tonight</i>

476
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:57,415
<i>I feel like having you tonight</i>

477
00:37:57,416 --> 00:37:59,375
Since when do you sing?

478
00:38:21,416 --> 00:38:24,249
- Okay.
- Let's go. One, two, three!

479
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:27,499
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three, four!

480
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,708
Oh, almost.

481
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:31,458
Almost.

482
00:40:58,916 --> 00:41:00,832
- Where's the exit?
- Huh?

483
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,083
Where's the exit?

484
00:41:04,625 --> 00:41:05,957
- You want me to stay here?
- No.

485
00:41:05,958 --> 00:41:07,041
Where's the exit?

486
00:41:10,666 --> 00:41:11,541
Let's go.

487
00:41:29,083 --> 00:41:33,290
Left wall, behind the pool,
there's an abandoned house.

488
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:35,333
After that, I don't know.

489
00:41:55,791 --> 00:41:57,082
No, no, no.

490
00:41:57,083 --> 00:41:59,124
- No. Please take everything!
- It's me.

491
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:00,707
- Take everything!
- It's Estela!

492
00:42:00,708 --> 00:42:01,999
- Open up!
- It's me!

493
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,458
Open up!

494
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:07,207
He left.

495
00:42:07,208 --> 00:42:08,958
- Close it. Close it.
- Yes, yes.

496
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,374
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

497
00:42:10,375 --> 00:42:12,999
- Lock the door.
- He came here fleeing the house next door.

498
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,874
- Listen, is everything locked?
- Yes, everything's locked.

499
00:42:15,875 --> 00:42:16,790
Call the police.

500
00:42:16,791 --> 00:42:19,416
Yes, I called, but he broke my phone.
I can't see anything.

501
00:42:20,458 --> 00:42:22,790
- Call security, then.
- Yeah, I already called.

502
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:24,333
I can't see anything now.

503
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:49,125
Listen.

504
00:42:49,625 --> 00:42:52,625
- Who should I talk to, to tell them...
- I can't now. Wait a second.

505
00:42:54,416 --> 00:42:56,624
- Good evening.
- Hello. Good evening.

506
00:42:56,625 --> 00:42:58,250
Come with me.

507
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:06,250
<i>The neighbor,</i>

508
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
<i>they tied her up, alone,
in the back bathroom,</i>

509
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,375
<i>and the rest, all together,
the husband with the children.</i>

510
00:43:15,875 --> 00:43:17,208
What a horror story!

511
00:43:19,291 --> 00:43:21,750
How can anyone
do something like that to a mom?

512
00:43:24,166 --> 00:43:25,833
That's evil, Estela.

513
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:28,583
Or it's confusion.

514
00:43:29,166 --> 00:43:32,165
He was a very young boy.
He still had a baby face.

515
00:43:32,166 --> 00:43:36,125
Oh, we can't even be safe
in our own home anymore.

516
00:43:39,166 --> 00:43:41,541
I don't know how you dared
to leave the room.

517
00:43:42,125 --> 00:43:44,166
You were really brave.

518
00:43:44,666 --> 00:43:47,666
But something could've happened to you.
Luckily, nothing did.

519
00:43:49,791 --> 00:43:51,208
Is there any boiling water left?

520
00:43:51,708 --> 00:43:53,665
Yes. Would you like some tea?

521
00:43:53,666 --> 00:43:55,040
Yes, please.

522
00:43:55,041 --> 00:43:56,041
I'm on it.

523
00:44:01,166 --> 00:44:02,250
<i>Hello. Are you okay?</i>

524
00:44:03,166 --> 00:44:05,208
I just wanted to talk to her.

525
00:44:05,958 --> 00:44:07,749
<i>You sent me less than what we agreed on.</i>

526
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:09,582
Yes, I haven't been paid yet.

527
00:44:09,583 --> 00:44:11,916
<i>They won't pay you in advance
even with your mother sick?</i>

528
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,040
How long is your leave?

529
00:44:14,041 --> 00:44:15,832
<i>Ten days. I can't ask for more.</i>

530
00:44:15,833 --> 00:44:17,207
All right.

531
00:44:17,208 --> 00:44:18,457
I'm sorting things out.

532
00:44:18,458 --> 00:44:21,207
<i>And it's not a "leave." It's my vacation.</i>

533
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:23,083
I'll make it up to you for all those days.

534
00:44:26,875 --> 00:44:29,124
Let me know tomorrow
when she's awake, okay?

535
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:30,582
<i>Maybe she'll sleep late.</i>

536
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:33,166
<i>She didn't want to eat.
She didn't want anything.</i>

537
00:45:22,875 --> 00:45:23,791
What?

538
00:45:27,708 --> 00:45:30,291
No barking here, okay?

539
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:53,583
Put them in the hall closet instead.

540
00:45:54,625 --> 00:45:55,957
For safety.

541
00:45:55,958 --> 00:45:57,916
Don't let Julia in here, okay?

542
00:46:30,708 --> 00:46:31,999
Where's Julia?

543
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,999
She's not here.

544
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,125
Julia?

545
00:46:37,208 --> 00:46:39,208
Were you scared by the thief?

546
00:46:41,958 --> 00:46:42,916
No.

547
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,666
He was more afraid.

548
00:46:48,333 --> 00:46:51,832
Imagine, entering a house
where you don't know anyone.

549
00:46:51,833 --> 00:46:53,999
It's night. Everything's dark.

550
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,791
There are people screaming, scared.

551
00:46:57,291 --> 00:46:59,124
The police are looking for you.

552
00:46:59,125 --> 00:47:00,375
No.

553
00:47:01,625 --> 00:47:03,833
He was scared. He was shaking.

554
00:47:08,083 --> 00:47:09,416
This house is scary.

555
00:47:11,291 --> 00:47:13,915
Good thing the thief didn't go
in your parents' room.

556
00:47:13,916 --> 00:47:16,707
He would've come across
your grandma's portrait.

557
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:17,875
My grandma.

558
00:47:21,291 --> 00:47:22,750
Because she's like this.

559
00:47:26,791 --> 00:47:30,166
- I'm scared of my grandma.
- Yes, it would have scared him more.

560
00:47:37,333 --> 00:47:38,250
A dog!

561
00:47:44,833 --> 00:47:46,208
Come! Come!

562
00:47:46,708 --> 00:47:47,790
What's its name?

563
00:47:47,791 --> 00:47:49,375
His name is Dadú.

564
00:47:49,916 --> 00:47:52,457
Is that why you had the door closed?

565
00:47:52,458 --> 00:47:53,375
Yes.

566
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:59,625
He reminds me of a dog
that belonged to the Jaimes,

567
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:01,541
when I was little.

568
00:48:04,375 --> 00:48:07,166
I lived near two boys my age.

569
00:48:07,666 --> 00:48:10,791
One was named Jaime,
and the other one was his twin,

570
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:14,125
who we also called Jaime
to avoid a mix-up.

571
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:17,666
And I liked the Jaimes.
I gave them kisses.

572
00:48:18,166 --> 00:48:20,374
- I gave a kiss to one--
- How did you kiss them?

573
00:48:20,375 --> 00:48:21,375
Like this.

574
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:25,208
And then I kissed the other Jaime.

575
00:48:26,166 --> 00:48:30,000
And then the Jaimes kissed each other,
like they were kissing a mirror.

576
00:48:33,416 --> 00:48:34,708
You're so squeamish.

577
00:48:35,291 --> 00:48:36,541
It was nice.

578
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:38,833
It's my turn to drive.

579
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:40,708
Come.

580
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,999
Where do you want me to take you?

581
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,125
Home.

582
00:48:49,375 --> 00:48:51,666
Weren't we supposed to meet today at 8:00?

583
00:48:53,375 --> 00:48:55,125
Yes, it's 8:00.

584
00:48:59,458 --> 00:49:01,291
The clocks changed, right?

585
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:07,082
It's just that I don't like
daylight savings time, so...

586
00:49:07,083 --> 00:49:08,458
I don't adjust my clock.

587
00:49:13,916 --> 00:49:16,416
That means I gotta go. Bye-bye.

588
00:49:16,916 --> 00:49:18,457
Hey!

589
00:49:18,458 --> 00:49:19,374
What?

590
00:49:19,375 --> 00:49:21,750
- What was that?
- "Hey," what?

591
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,457
What a lame first kiss.

592
00:49:30,458 --> 00:49:32,291
"Lame" this, "lame" that.

593
00:50:11,791 --> 00:50:12,625
<i>Estela!</i>

594
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:15,833
- Help me, please.
- Yeah.

595
00:50:21,375 --> 00:50:22,458
There, it seems.

596
00:50:24,458 --> 00:50:25,541
Yes, that was it.

597
00:50:26,791 --> 00:50:27,666
Good.

598
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,250
How did it go, Iván?

599
00:50:45,791 --> 00:50:48,708
Good. I already spoke
with the security company.

600
00:50:49,208 --> 00:50:51,665
After the New Year,
they'll come to install the cameras.

601
00:50:51,666 --> 00:50:55,291
- Okay.
- Then they'll install the electric fence.

602
00:50:56,291 --> 00:50:58,666
They'll cover all the vulnerabilities.

603
00:50:59,333 --> 00:51:01,332
- Thank you very much, Iván.
- You're welcome.

604
00:51:01,333 --> 00:51:02,250
Finally.

605
00:51:03,916 --> 00:51:05,375
Hey, the girl,

606
00:51:05,875 --> 00:51:07,708
has she learned to swim yet?

607
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:11,750
She makes it to the edge by herself.
She knows how to get out.

608
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:13,082
That's great!

609
00:51:13,083 --> 00:51:14,915
So with a little more training,

610
00:51:14,916 --> 00:51:17,083
she'll be able to represent us
at the Olympics.

611
00:51:19,791 --> 00:51:21,957
But what do you see on the street?

612
00:51:21,958 --> 00:51:22,957
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

613
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:24,499
Nothing? No.

614
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,582
There's always something on the street.

615
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:29,999
And that's where the danger lies.
That's where the criminals hide.

616
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,790
Iván, you'll traumatize them more.

617
00:51:32,791 --> 00:51:35,208
Okay, kids, go home.

618
00:51:40,666 --> 00:51:41,915
- Thank you so much.
- Oh, Iván.

619
00:51:41,916 --> 00:51:43,124
Yes?

620
00:51:43,125 --> 00:51:45,499
Add me to the security chat, please.

621
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:46,582
Sure.

622
00:51:46,583 --> 00:51:48,666
At your service. Let's see. What is it?

623
00:51:49,166 --> 00:51:51,124
- Four...
- Four...

624
00:51:51,125 --> 00:51:53,499
- ...four, two, two...
- ...four, two, two...

625
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:54,666
...nine, two...

626
00:51:55,333 --> 00:51:56,874
- ...nine, two...
- ...eight, nine.

627
00:51:56,875 --> 00:51:58,707
- ...eight, nine.
- Estela García.

628
00:51:58,708 --> 00:52:00,165
There, from the Jensens'.

629
00:52:00,166 --> 00:52:01,082
What are you feeling?

630
00:52:01,083 --> 00:52:05,041
<i>A cold sensation on my back, here.</i>

631
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,790
Okay, but what did the doctor say?

632
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,499
<i>Oh, Lita!</i>

633
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,416
<i>They know what they're doing.</i>

634
00:52:12,583 --> 00:52:15,791
It's because you just had surgery.
You'll feel better in no time.

635
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:18,041
<i>Where's the girl?</i>

636
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:21,541
<i>Hi, Julia!</i>

637
00:52:22,583 --> 00:52:23,583
Hello!

638
00:52:25,541 --> 00:52:27,875
<i>Does the dog watch TV too?</i>

639
00:52:29,375 --> 00:52:32,291
A man set his body on fire.

640
00:52:32,791 --> 00:52:35,957
<i>Oh, Lita, don't let the girl
watch those things.</i>

641
00:52:35,958 --> 00:52:37,832
<i>She'll have bad dreams.</i>

642
00:52:37,833 --> 00:52:39,207
She wants to watch it.

643
00:52:39,208 --> 00:52:41,041
<i>Stubborn, like you.</i>

644
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:45,333
<i>Well, that's why you're alone.</i>

645
00:52:46,208 --> 00:52:47,416
I'm not alone.

646
00:52:47,916 --> 00:52:49,041
<i>No?</i>

647
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:51,333
<i>Oh, really?</i>

648
00:52:58,958 --> 00:53:03,500
PROTECTED NEIGHBORHOOD

649
00:53:06,333 --> 00:53:09,125
Straight, straight, lowering your leg.

650
00:53:11,666 --> 00:53:12,958
There's no wall anymore.

651
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:15,333
The other one.

652
00:53:16,083 --> 00:53:17,416
One, two, three.

653
00:53:18,125 --> 00:53:19,665
All the way up. That's it!

654
00:53:19,666 --> 00:53:21,500
<i>I wanna take him to Chiloé.</i>

655
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,291
He'd be happy, running free,
annoying the pigs, eating a rabbit.

656
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:30,833
When are you leaving?

657
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:33,457
Not sure.

658
00:53:33,458 --> 00:53:36,291
My mom seems better now.

659
00:53:36,916 --> 00:53:39,291
But some days,
I call her and she's not so good.

660
00:53:40,166 --> 00:53:41,707
It's not linear.

661
00:53:41,708 --> 00:53:43,208
Will you sell us a beer?

662
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,291
What have I told you?

663
00:53:45,791 --> 00:53:47,166
Come on. What's the big deal?

664
00:53:47,875 --> 00:53:49,707
- Dadú!
- I already told you no.

665
00:53:49,708 --> 00:53:52,791
- Just sell it to them so they'll go away.
- Let's go, Dadú.

666
00:53:53,458 --> 00:53:55,624
This time of day
is no good for little kids.

667
00:53:55,625 --> 00:53:56,583
Dadú!

668
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:01,833
Dadú.

669
00:54:03,625 --> 00:54:04,665
Awesome!

670
00:54:04,666 --> 00:54:06,207
- Dadú.
- Thanks, chief.

671
00:54:06,208 --> 00:54:07,916
<i>A nun yelled at me,</i>

672
00:54:08,708 --> 00:54:11,790
and with all my strength,
I took the plate of stew

673
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:14,916
and threw it
onto the Mother Superior's face.

674
00:54:15,458 --> 00:54:16,416
Pow.

675
00:54:19,833 --> 00:54:23,125
Well, that same afternoon
my mom had to pick me up.

676
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:29,375
All the way back home,
she didn't say a word.

677
00:54:30,791 --> 00:54:33,625
And when we were getting home,
she started to laugh.

678
00:54:34,125 --> 00:54:36,166
To laugh and laugh and laugh.

679
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,208
"All the stew on her face," she said.

680
00:54:39,708 --> 00:54:41,083
Dying laughing.

681
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:44,957
Well, my mom had to go back to work.

682
00:54:44,958 --> 00:54:46,833
And then she said to me, "Estelita,

683
00:54:47,333 --> 00:54:49,666
you'll have to learn
to take care of yourself."

684
00:54:52,041 --> 00:54:54,000
And she left, and there I was,

685
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,333
at 13 years old, about to turn 14,

686
00:54:58,583 --> 00:54:59,541
alone.

687
00:55:02,083 --> 00:55:03,082
Yes, sir?

688
00:55:03,083 --> 00:55:04,249
Dadú!

689
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:05,582
How can I help you?

690
00:55:05,583 --> 00:55:06,916
It's late. Let's go.

691
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:00,707
<i>Hey, what if I come by at 12:00</i>

692
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:03,791
<i>and we have a beer on the side street?</i>

693
00:57:06,541 --> 00:57:09,333
I can tell you're bored.

694
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:17,290
She's the only granddaughter they have,

695
00:57:17,291 --> 00:57:19,583
and they didn't even come
for her birthday.

696
00:57:20,333 --> 00:57:21,707
Hey, Estela.

697
00:57:21,708 --> 00:57:22,708
But...

698
00:57:24,916 --> 00:57:28,500
Hey, saying that,
classic favorite child, huh?

699
00:57:30,125 --> 00:57:32,000
Girl, go to the country for a while.

700
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:15,500
Oh, you almost knocked it over!

701
00:58:36,958 --> 00:58:38,125
Are you okay?

702
00:58:39,166 --> 00:58:40,041
Let's go.

703
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:08,915
Hi, Carlos. I won't be able to today.

704
00:59:08,916 --> 00:59:11,541
See you tomorrow on my day off, please?

705
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:14,125
Look.

706
00:59:16,041 --> 00:59:17,791
My song!

707
00:59:58,166 --> 00:59:59,875
No! No! No!

708
01:00:26,333 --> 01:00:28,790
<i>...spectacular,
one of the best in the world,</i>

709
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:30,624
<i>in Latin America.</i>

710
01:00:30,625 --> 01:00:32,290
<i>And now we're almost</i>

711
01:00:32,291 --> 01:00:34,665
<i>one minute to midnight,</i>

712
01:00:34,666 --> 01:00:38,624
<i>so you can say goodbye
to all the bad things you went through,</i>

713
01:00:38,625 --> 01:00:40,207
<i>keep the good memories,</i>

714
01:00:40,208 --> 01:00:44,415
<i>and prepare to take on a wonderful year.</i>

715
01:00:44,416 --> 01:00:49,083
<i>Another year ends,
and the show's about to start.</i>

716
01:00:49,625 --> 01:00:52,499
<i>- Mayor, let's see the lights go out.

- Happy New Year!
- Julia!

722
01:01:06,791 --> 01:01:07,916
Julia!

723
01:01:33,458 --> 01:01:34,582
Happy New Year!

724
01:01:34,583 --> 01:01:36,916
Bring us luck! Bring us luck!

725
01:01:39,458 --> 01:01:41,250
Happy New Year, Estela!

726
01:01:47,041 --> 01:01:48,666
Cheers!

727
01:01:52,666 --> 01:01:55,583
Happy New Year, honey!

728
01:01:56,125 --> 01:01:57,791
I hope it's a beautiful one.

729
01:02:04,625 --> 01:02:05,999
Estela!

730
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,791
Happy New Year.

731
01:02:14,125 --> 01:02:17,375
- Best wishes. I hope it'll be a good year.
- Happy New Year.

732
01:02:18,916 --> 01:02:20,040
I hope it'll be a good one.

733
01:02:20,041 --> 01:02:22,041
- Same to you.
- Thanks.

734
01:02:25,083 --> 01:02:26,208
Julia!

735
01:02:27,458 --> 01:02:28,666
Julia!

736
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:31,750
Tell her to come!

737
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:34,250
Julia!

738
01:02:35,083 --> 01:02:36,208
Bring her!

739
01:02:36,708 --> 01:02:37,833
Come!

740
01:02:39,083 --> 01:02:40,041
Come!

741
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:42,541
- Julia!
- Julia!

742
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:11,582
Hello! Hello, sweetie!

743
01:03:11,583 --> 01:03:14,083
Hello!

744
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:16,000
Happy New Year.

745
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:19,333
- How are you?
- Good.

746
01:03:25,958 --> 01:03:26,957
Thank you.

747
01:03:26,958 --> 01:03:30,916
Okay, okay, okay.

748
01:03:32,583 --> 01:03:33,625
Is that your room?

749
01:03:34,208 --> 01:03:35,125
Yes, yes.

750
01:03:35,708 --> 01:03:36,958
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

751
01:03:38,916 --> 01:03:40,249
Let's go. Come on.

752
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:41,541
Come on!

753
01:03:46,125 --> 01:03:48,708
If you're not going to use it,
give it to me.

754
01:03:50,125 --> 01:03:51,874
What good is it to you?

755
01:03:51,875 --> 01:03:53,875
I don't want to fall in love.

756
01:03:54,375 --> 01:03:56,125
Me neither.

757
01:03:59,166 --> 01:04:01,458
And why do you do that?

758
01:04:02,041 --> 01:04:03,708
Just in case.

759
01:04:09,708 --> 01:04:11,332
Are you dating someone?

760
01:04:11,333 --> 01:04:13,125
Who told you I'm dating someone?

761
01:04:15,333 --> 01:04:16,915
<i>I want to go with you.</i>

762
01:04:16,916 --> 01:04:20,458
My uncle told me we'd go horseback riding.

763
01:04:20,958 --> 01:04:23,540
That's not going to happen.
Your uncle won't be able to take you.

764
01:04:23,541 --> 01:04:26,666
I don't care
that he's institutionalized and crazy.

765
01:04:27,583 --> 01:04:31,290
Who told you that your uncle's crazy?
Where did you get that from?

766
01:04:31,291 --> 01:04:33,540
She's clearly not deaf.

767
01:04:33,541 --> 01:04:35,833
- Okay. Go play with your dad.
- Let's go with your daddy.

768
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:40,166
<i>Estela!</i>

769
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:46,499
I need to take off.

770
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:48,250
But today's my day off.

771
01:04:49,041 --> 01:04:51,333
I have to be at the hospital
in 18 minutes.

772
01:04:51,833 --> 01:04:55,333
The patient is unstable,
and now she needs emergency surgery.

773
01:04:55,833 --> 01:04:58,708
I'll be out all night.
We'll square this away later, okay?

774
01:05:23,166 --> 01:05:24,040
<i>Hello!</i>

775
01:05:24,041 --> 01:05:25,749
- Hi, Estela.
- Hi, Estela.

776
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:27,999
- I want to ask you a question.
- Okay.

777
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,332
Can Julia come to a sleepover
at my house tonight?

778
01:05:30,333 --> 01:05:32,499
We'll buy pizzas for everybody.

779
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,082
Yes, we're having pizza today.

780
01:05:34,083 --> 01:05:35,624
Julia isn't here.

781
01:05:35,625 --> 01:05:37,332
She went out with her mother.

782
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:40,707
So... it'll have to be another day.

783
01:05:40,708 --> 01:05:42,040
Come on, Juanita.

784
01:05:42,041 --> 01:05:44,249
Thank you. We'll coordinate.

785
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:48,000
- What topping do you like?
- She's lying!

786
01:05:52,166 --> 01:05:55,416
Lord God in heaven.

787
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,707
That's not what funerals are like.

788
01:05:57,708 --> 01:05:59,666
The dead don't speak.

789
01:06:00,291 --> 01:06:02,041
Evil be gone.

790
01:06:02,541 --> 01:06:05,458
Be gone. Be gone. Open your mouth.

791
01:06:14,875 --> 01:06:16,416
Little brat!

792
01:06:32,166 --> 01:06:33,499
Was he bit by a mouse?

793
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:34,750
No, Julia, no.

794
01:06:35,708 --> 01:06:37,250
No, Julia, no! No!

795
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:40,458
Get out!

796
01:06:47,791 --> 01:06:49,041
It hurts.

797
01:07:21,708 --> 01:07:24,166
We'll give her a rabies shot,
just in case.

798
01:07:29,291 --> 01:07:31,125
Mom, hold her arm.

799
01:07:34,416 --> 01:07:36,000
That's it. Just a second.

800
01:07:53,375 --> 01:07:54,833
I'm going to get the medication.

801
01:08:22,625 --> 01:08:24,125
Take that helmet off, Julia.

802
01:08:24,875 --> 01:08:26,333
Take it off, Julia.

803
01:08:28,041 --> 01:08:29,750
It's dangerous, Carlos.

804
01:08:30,375 --> 01:08:31,874
But she came by motorcycle.

805
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:33,375
It's not safe. Let's go.

806
01:09:28,833 --> 01:09:30,750
- Estela.
- Good morning.

807
01:09:32,583 --> 01:09:33,666
Good morning.

808
01:09:38,458 --> 01:09:42,250
The girl had a...
a complication during surgery.

809
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,541
Septic embolism.

810
01:09:46,208 --> 01:09:47,708
She died during the operation.

811
01:09:51,541 --> 01:09:52,666
She died?

812
01:09:54,458 --> 01:09:58,875
We revived her for more than half an hour
after the operation, but...

813
01:10:00,791 --> 01:10:02,500
she never left the operating room.

814
01:10:05,041 --> 01:10:07,625
Well, you did your best.

815
01:10:09,375 --> 01:10:10,833
I need to sleep.

816
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:15,040
Please don't let Julia wake me up. Okay?

817
01:10:15,041 --> 01:10:16,083
Okay.

818
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:23,791
I want him to come.

819
01:10:25,416 --> 01:10:28,250
It wasn't his fault. It was the mouse's.

820
01:10:29,125 --> 01:10:30,708
Don't repeat that again.

821
01:10:31,833 --> 01:10:33,333
I want him to come.

822
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:37,083
No, there's no dog.
There never was. He doesn't exist.

823
01:10:43,125 --> 01:10:44,125
Come, Julia.

824
01:10:44,708 --> 01:10:45,707
Let's watch TV.

825
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:47,291
I don't want to watch TV.

826
01:10:48,458 --> 01:10:49,999
I'll lend you my amulet.

827
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,333
That's for adults, not for kids.

828
01:11:02,083 --> 01:11:03,582
Mom!

829
01:11:03,583 --> 01:11:05,250
I'm home.

830
01:11:06,625 --> 01:11:09,250
Where's my Chinita? Where is she?

831
01:11:10,041 --> 01:11:12,958
Hi, sweetie. I brought you something.

832
01:11:14,375 --> 01:11:16,750
It arrived safely. Grandma sent you this.

833
01:11:18,166 --> 01:11:20,166
You use perfume now?

834
01:11:21,458 --> 01:11:22,499
Hi.

835
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:24,458
- Hi.
- Hi.

836
01:11:26,375 --> 01:11:27,707
Were you sleeping?

837
01:11:27,708 --> 01:11:28,666
Yeah.

838
01:11:29,208 --> 01:11:30,708
You stole my Alprazolam.

839
01:11:31,291 --> 01:11:33,249
Two. But I'm much better now.

840
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:34,208
I'm glad.

841
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:37,583
How did everything go there?

842
01:11:38,291 --> 01:11:41,124
Great. We had breakfast,
all together at 7:00 in the morning.

843
01:11:41,125 --> 01:11:43,375
Just like when we were kids before school.

844
01:11:49,833 --> 01:11:51,375
Window or hallway?

845
01:11:52,916 --> 01:11:55,333
First floor, and far from the bathroom.

846
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,583
Done.

847
01:12:01,583 --> 01:12:02,707
Thank you very much.

848
01:12:02,708 --> 01:12:06,541
With the screen like this,
it wouldn't let me press "next."

849
01:12:10,083 --> 01:12:11,291
You slept here?

850
01:12:13,416 --> 01:12:16,040
The homeowner is back, so while he's here...

851
01:12:16,041 --> 01:12:19,125
It's just a few days.
They lend me a little room back there.

852
01:12:29,833 --> 01:12:31,166
The dog hasn't turned up?

853
01:12:31,833 --> 01:12:33,500
No, but he always comes back.

854
01:12:35,791 --> 01:12:37,875
He must be mad at me.

855
01:12:40,625 --> 01:12:41,541
Thank you.

856
01:12:45,541 --> 01:12:47,625
Thieves are very slippery.

857
01:12:52,375 --> 01:12:54,000
Okay. Take note.

858
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:58,124
Three wires above, one below.
At 12,000 volts.

859
01:12:58,125 --> 01:12:59,457
How many volts?

860
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:00,749
- 12,000.
- 12,000 volts?

861
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:02,624
Yes. So no one can pass.

862
01:13:02,625 --> 01:13:05,708
- I just want it to work well, that's all.
- It will work well. Very well.

863
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:08,916
It burns.

864
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,916
If it burns, it means it's healing.

865
01:13:13,916 --> 01:13:16,166
You'll be all better to go to the lake.

866
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,290
What would you prefer?

867
01:13:21,291 --> 01:13:22,791
A cruise

868
01:13:23,291 --> 01:13:26,875
with ghosts, and you're the only one alive

869
01:13:27,916 --> 01:13:31,749
or the beach, with your favorite person

870
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:34,041
surrounded by

871
01:13:34,708 --> 01:13:36,708
killer sharks?

872
01:13:37,208 --> 01:13:39,000
I'd rather be with you,

873
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:40,750
at the lake.

874
01:13:42,416 --> 01:13:45,582
I'm going to visit my mom first,
and then I'm going there.

875
01:13:45,583 --> 01:13:47,291
I already have the tickets.

876
01:13:50,041 --> 01:13:51,000
Deal.

877
01:14:00,166 --> 01:14:02,791
We're going to rest so much.

878
01:14:03,875 --> 01:14:05,833
We're going to get sick of sleeping.

879
01:14:09,625 --> 01:14:12,583
We're going to stay on the boat,
floating until late.

880
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,666
Looking at the stars.

881
01:14:57,375 --> 01:14:59,916
<i>Hi. Is Estela home?</i>

882
01:15:28,375 --> 01:15:30,833
<i>How could I tell you
something like that by phone?</i>

883
01:15:33,375 --> 01:15:34,833
The neighbor found her.

884
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,540
Don't be mad at me.

885
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:48,040
I had left for Punta Arenas for work.

886
01:15:48,041 --> 01:15:51,291
Things are very bad.
There's no money for anything.

887
01:15:52,333 --> 01:15:53,500
Where is she?

888
01:15:56,875 --> 01:15:58,083
She was buried.

889
01:15:58,833 --> 01:16:00,666
Pedro is taking care of it.

890
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,291
He finally turned up.

891
01:19:22,041 --> 01:19:22,958
Go.

892
01:19:27,875 --> 01:19:29,250
We ordered pizza.

893
01:19:30,666 --> 01:19:32,000
You'd better eat.

894
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,541
Resting helps a lot.

895
01:19:43,958 --> 01:19:47,458
Oh, you're back!

896
01:19:51,791 --> 01:19:53,458
We just came for a little while.

897
01:19:53,958 --> 01:19:55,333
I'm being covered.

898
01:19:57,083 --> 01:19:58,333
So spoiled.

899
01:19:59,041 --> 01:19:59,916
Okay.

900
01:20:02,083 --> 01:20:03,249
<i>Are you better?</i>

901
01:20:03,250 --> 01:20:04,458
Yes.

902
01:20:09,041 --> 01:20:11,166
Bye.

903
01:20:59,875 --> 01:21:02,375
<i>Let's record her, the author.</i>

904
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:06,875
<i>Enough.</i>

905
01:21:09,375 --> 01:21:10,916
<i>She's hiding.</i>

906
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:21,791
<i>I can see your face there.</i>

907
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:39,250
<i>The actress.</i>

908
01:22:15,916 --> 01:22:18,374
Would you rather your dream home,

909
01:22:18,375 --> 01:22:21,124
with your own beach, or...

910
01:22:21,125 --> 01:22:23,833
your... jet,

911
01:22:25,166 --> 01:22:26,333
private jet?

912
01:22:26,916 --> 01:22:30,875
It's your house and can fly anywhere.

913
01:22:31,375 --> 01:22:32,625
What do you prefer?

914
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,541
What do you prefer?

915
01:22:37,416 --> 01:22:39,375
Without help, it's not a vacation for me.

916
01:22:40,125 --> 01:22:40,958
Right.

917
01:22:41,875 --> 01:22:44,166
I liked the one that covered for you.

918
01:22:44,666 --> 01:22:45,874
I think she was the sister

919
01:22:45,875 --> 01:22:48,749
of the one who usually works with you
and worked as a substitute.

920
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:50,791
She was really nice, remember?

921
01:22:51,791 --> 01:22:52,625
Her.

922
01:22:53,166 --> 01:22:54,291
Yes, her.

923
01:22:55,625 --> 01:22:57,208
What? Estela isn't coming?

924
01:22:57,750 --> 01:22:59,457
- No, Chinita, she's not.
- She told me...

925
01:22:59,458 --> 01:23:02,750
Estela asked not to go to Caburgua,
so we'll have to give her time.

926
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:04,665
Okay, I'll call you.

927
01:23:04,666 --> 01:23:05,915
Liar!

928
01:23:05,916 --> 01:23:06,916
Julia.

929
01:23:16,166 --> 01:23:17,333
Ugly!

930
01:23:18,708 --> 01:23:19,625
No.

931
01:23:24,541 --> 01:23:25,833
Fake!

932
01:23:29,083 --> 01:23:30,041
Julia.

933
01:23:31,041 --> 01:23:33,791
- You told me you were going!
- Julia.

934
01:23:34,291 --> 01:23:35,583
Idiot!

935
01:23:37,958 --> 01:23:38,957
Julia!

936
01:23:38,958 --> 01:23:41,249
What's wrong with you?

937
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:42,582
Sorry, Estela.

938
01:23:42,583 --> 01:23:44,082
Hey, what's wrong with you?

939
01:23:44,083 --> 01:23:45,749
- What's wrong with you?
- Idiot!

940
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:47,416
- Stop!
- No!

941
01:24:13,458 --> 01:24:15,457
No. No. Get out!

942
01:24:15,458 --> 01:24:17,125
Get out! Get out!

943
01:24:17,875 --> 01:24:19,124
How did you get in?

944
01:24:19,125 --> 01:24:20,833
Get out! Get out!

945
01:24:21,541 --> 01:24:22,791
Dadú!

946
01:24:25,541 --> 01:24:27,165
- No.
- Dadú!

947
01:24:27,166 --> 01:24:28,250
Julia?

948
01:24:28,750 --> 01:24:30,000
Whose dog is that?

949
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:32,165
Come here. Come.

950
01:24:32,166 --> 01:24:33,458
Julia, come here.

951
01:24:34,875 --> 01:24:36,707
Why do you know that dog?

952
01:24:36,708 --> 01:24:38,124
Why do you know him?

953
01:24:38,125 --> 01:24:39,874
Because it bit me.

954
01:24:39,875 --> 01:24:41,040
That dog bit you?

955
01:24:41,041 --> 01:24:44,250
Yes, and she took me
to the hospital on a motorcycle.

956
01:24:45,083 --> 01:24:47,083
- She took you to hospital on a motorcycle?
- Yes.

957
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:54,375
Get out, dog! Get out! Go home!

958
01:25:00,666 --> 01:25:02,041
Estela, open up.

959
01:25:05,125 --> 01:25:06,291
Estela, open up.

960
01:25:15,666 --> 01:25:17,000
Open the door.

961
01:25:20,250 --> 01:25:21,458
Estela, open up.

962
01:25:43,083 --> 01:25:44,083
Look at me.

963
01:25:49,375 --> 01:25:50,708
What did I do to you?

964
01:25:55,083 --> 01:25:57,458
You really thought
she wasn't going to tell me?

965
01:26:00,333 --> 01:26:01,708
I'm her mom.

966
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:15,333
Get that stray out of the house now,
and pack your things.

967
01:26:45,750 --> 01:26:48,125
Go away, dog!

968
01:26:48,625 --> 01:26:49,958
Get out, dog!

969
01:26:50,458 --> 01:26:52,333
- I told you to get that dog out!
- Out!

970
01:26:52,833 --> 01:26:54,875
- To your room!
- Get out of here!

971
01:26:55,583 --> 01:26:56,500
Out!

972
01:26:57,125 --> 01:26:58,958
I don't want him to leave!

973
01:26:59,458 --> 01:27:00,499
Out!

974
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:01,416
No!

975
01:27:17,791 --> 01:27:21,750
DANGER
ELECTRIC FENCE

976
01:27:22,458 --> 01:27:24,916
No, Estela, don't touch it!
You could be electrocuted!

977
01:27:51,333 --> 01:27:52,333
Iván!

978
01:27:54,708 --> 01:27:56,166
Iván, help!

979
01:28:00,875 --> 01:28:01,875
Iván!

980
01:28:03,625 --> 01:28:05,291
Iván, come here, please!

981
01:28:05,875 --> 01:28:06,958
Iván, come!

982
01:28:39,583 --> 01:28:40,625
Stay here.

983
01:28:45,750 --> 01:28:46,832
Estela, no!

984
01:28:46,833 --> 01:28:47,833
Julia!

985
01:29:38,666 --> 01:29:40,041
It's okay, Estela.

986
01:29:42,041 --> 01:29:43,041
It's over now.

987
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:47,625
It's okay.

988
01:32:34,875 --> 01:32:36,000
Hello, Iván.

989
01:32:37,375 --> 01:32:39,291
I don't work there anymore.

990
01:32:45,958 --> 01:32:48,750
Yes, I'm already leaving.

991
01:32:51,833 --> 01:32:52,750
What?

992
01:33:01,708 --> 01:33:03,166
What happened to the girl?

993
01:33:08,375 --> 01:33:09,708
Sir, stop!

994
01:33:13,083 --> 01:33:14,375
I need to get off!

3
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:45,916
<i>They say history is important.</i>

4
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:51,375
<i>In school I had to learn
dates and names by heart.</i>

5
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:55,458
<i>Because that, they said, that's history.</i>

6
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:58,083
<i>The year of some battle.</i>

7
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:03,500
<i>The date some bastard, who as a leader
did unspeakable things for years, died.</i>

8
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:05,000
<i>You name it.</i>

9
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:11,125
<i>But nobody knows what history really is.</i>

10
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:12,916
<i>Do you understand me?</i>

11
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:15,166
<i>No.</i>

12
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:18,500
<i>You'll have to see it with your own eyes.</i>

13
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:25,041
<i>People say, "Wow, you survived the war.
Being a cop no less, respect."</i>

14
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:29,083
<i>Others say, "You scumbag,
you should have done this, or that.</i>

15
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:31,125
<i>Why did you let that happen?"</i>

16
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,708
<i>You know what it is?</i>

17
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:36,750
<i>People always judge.</i>

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,750
<i>Always after the fact.</i>

19
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:43,000
<i>But when you're in the middle of it,</i>

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,083
<i>when you don't know
what tomorrow will bring,</i>

21
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:51,875
<i>and nobody does, not you, nor I,</i>

22
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:55,833
<i>then you don't know shit.</i>

23
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:59,291
Welcome to the Antwerp police force.

24
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:05,875
You are the mediators
between our people and the Germans.

25
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:12,875
Your uniform commands respect,
so keep it clean. And yourselves as well.

26
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:18,666
You always run everything
by your superiors first.

27
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:24,708
And you follow their orders
to the letter, of course.

28
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:26,166
Alright?

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,125
There, that was the official part.

30
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:33,125
Now off the record.
Clément, close the door.

31
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:39,500
Men, know that when you hit
the streets tomorrow,

32
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:44,166
your extensive,
two-and-a-half-week training

33
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,791
is going to be completely useless.

34
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,625
Totally, utterly useless.

35
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:55,791
Because there's only one thing
you need to remember.

36
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,541
Just one.

37
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:03,500
<i>I saw two bears buttering their bread</i>

38
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,208
<i>What a wondrous thing</i>

39
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:09,250
Sing along.
<i>It was a wonder</i>

40
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:13,625
Come on, sing along, guys.
<i>A great big wonder</i>

41
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:17,583
Come on, everyone.
<i>That those bears could butter like that</i>

42
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,166
Everyone. Dieter.

43
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,500
<i>I was standing there and looked at it</i>

44
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:27,958
Did you hear that?
"I was standing there and looked at it?"

45
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:32,541
That's the thing you need to remember.

46
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:36,208
You stand there and you just watch.

47
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:44,416
- How big is your Aunt Alice's arse?
- Easily something like this, I'd say.

48
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,416
Perfect as a shelf.

49
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:52,166
Wait, because here it comes. Aunt Alice
bends over and while she's doing that,

50
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,375
she looks me straight in the eye.
And she keeps staring.

51
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,250
She stands there just like this.

52
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,791
You get that?

53
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,250
That's a big arse.

54
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,750
Is that her?

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,625
Is that her?

56
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,750
Three francs for a drawing.

57
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,750
Recruits!

58
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:56,666
There are people who refuse to work
at this address. They must be arrested.

59
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,833
Take me there.

60
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:02,458
- Shouldn't they always work in pairs?
- I thought so too.

61
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,375
What's with the talking?

62
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:07,166
Hurry up.

63
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,291
It does look like an order.

64
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,083
You're a funny one.

65
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,041
What are you waiting for?

66
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,583
- Let's go.
- There you go.

67
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:37,333
ANTWERP, 1942

68
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,000
Chaim Lizke?

69
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,291
- Yes.
- You're coming with us.

70
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:55,708
Me? What for?
Gentlemen, there must be a mistake.

71
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,000
Now.

72
00:05:57,666 --> 00:06:02,041
- Can I see your warrant?
- I don't show Jews the warrant.

73
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:08,833
I understand. You want money.
You'd better come in then.

74
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,333
Come on in.

75
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,750
Nobody leaves this house.

76
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,041
Where's the money?

77
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:24,166
Here. Follow me. It's in here.

78
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:29,083
Let me through.
I want to leave her with the neighbours.

79
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,291
Please.

80
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,500
Please.

81
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:48,083
- Jeanne, can she stay with you, please?
- Myriam.

82
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:52,166
- I'll come back as soon as I can. Yes?
- Of course. Come.

83
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:56,250
Don't be scared. I'll be back soon.

84
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,916
Come on, sweetheart.

85
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,625
No.

86
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,208
- Mummy. Let me go!
- Calm down. Quiet.

87
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,291
- Mummy!
- Please, calm down.

88
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,375
I don't have all day, old man.

89
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:52,250
Hold on. Wait, please. Please.
I know... I know...

90
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,625
I've had enough of your games.

91
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:58,166
Do you hear me?
Or I'll shoot you all right now.

92
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,666
Understood?

93
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,000
We're decent people.
I know where the money is.

94
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,500
- Right, now you remember.
- Yes.

95
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,625
Please.

96
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,833
- No more games!
- Please.

97
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,541
Out! Out!

98
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:49,916
{\an8}NOTHING FOR HITLER
OUR FOOD IS FOR US!

99
00:08:56,333 --> 00:09:00,916
Shit. My pills. Nobody move.

100
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,708
Stop!

101
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:19,625
Stop her, you idiots!

102
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,000
Shit!

103
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,708
You stupid pig!

104
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,583
You fool. Let go!

105
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,041
Let me go!

106
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,791
Let me go! Mummy!

107
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:09,291
What are you doing? Dirty Jew lover!

108
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,541
Mummy!

109
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:25,000
- Look what you've done now!
- Please, no.

110
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,333
- Dirty Jew lover!
- Please!

111
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,166
Look what you've done.

112
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,125
Daddy.

113
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,500
Wilfried?

114
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,000
This isn't a dovecote.

115
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:10,708
You make money now, but that doesn't
mean you can do whatever you want.

116
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,541
What happened to you?

117
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:23,333
- Come on, you have to leave.
- Lode?

118
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,958
Where have you been all night?

119
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:35,583
Come here, brother. What happened?

120
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:20,041
- An SS officer, they say.
- No, you fool, a <i>Feldgendarm.</i>

121
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:23,291
The guys with those iron plates
around their necks.

122
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:27,375
- Anyway, it seems he disappeared here.
- How so, here?

123
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:31,250
- In this neighbourhood. Sixth district.
- On shift or off duty?

124
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:34,791
Well, think about it.
Hurry up, guys, sign in.

125
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:41,500
Idiots. Who would go to the Jewish quarter
on their own time, just for fun?

126
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,875
Well, maybe he was visiting a girl
or something.

127
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,208
Come on.

128
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:52,875
It's a very, very, very charming story
indeed.

129
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:57,458
- I find it all very bizarre.
- Right.

130
00:13:57,541 --> 00:14:03,458
I assume you've asked around a little.

131
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:07,541
There's nothing to ask. I was here

132
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:11,916
and we didn't see a <i>Feldgendarm.</i>
That's what I told you.

133
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:17,791
- He says that we didn't...
- Do you think we're complete idiots?

134
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,541
The missing <i>Feldgendarm</i> was given orders

135
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:25,541
for which he was to receive
a police escort first.

136
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:28,958
And this police station
was right on his route.

137
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:32,291
- Get the logbook.
- Yes, I'll get the...

138
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,416
And what does his colleague say?

139
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,000
Because they always
have to patrol in pairs, don't they?

140
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:43,416
Or was he doing something
his colleagues couldn't know about?

141
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,458
- Translate.
- No need.

142
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:49,958
It was a joke, right? Humour.

143
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,625
There's nothing in the book.

144
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,416
The way Jean looked at us...

145
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,458
He saw us.
He saw us with that <i>Feldgendarm.</i>

146
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,041
Calm down.

147
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:33,250
Jean insists that the guy was never here.
You heard that, didn't you?

148
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:37,291
What if they come to question us?

149
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,208
Then we say the same thing as Jean.

150
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:50,791
- What if someone else saw us?
- There was no one else, was there?

151
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:56,291
Come with me. I have a present.

152
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:11,125
Ah, those two.

153
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:13,750
Good.

154
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:28,666
Gentlemen, please, I urgently require
a transport escort. Communists.

155
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,291
Get out!

156
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,625
You want something to eat?

157
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,041
NOTHING FOR HITLER
OUR FOOD IS FOR US!

158
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:04,916
Eat.

159
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,708
Communist pigs will eat anything.

160
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:31,833
I want to give all those present
one more chance.

161
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:37,291
Can anyone tell me
what happened to the <i>Feldgendarm?</i>

162
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,541
Nobody?

163
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,458
Give me a number.

164
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,791
Between one and eight.

165
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,458
Come on.

166
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,375
Three.

167
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:16,833
One...

168
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,791
two...

169
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:27,000
three.

170
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,916
The <i>Feldgendarm.</i> Who knows something?

171
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,250
Get down.

172
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:47,125
One, two, three.

173
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:55,958
For every German soldier that gets hurt,
many of you will have to pay.

174
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,333
However...

175
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:09,375
you are in luck.

176
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:17,208
You're going on a journey

177
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:20,875
to the communist paradise.

178
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,875
Bloody hell.

179
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,625
Yes?

180
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:12,583
Sorry for disturbing you, Mr. Verschaffel.
It's Jozef.

181
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:16,500
- Can we ask you something? It's urgent.
- Sure.

182
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:41,083
I would never bother you
at this time of day. Again my apologies.

183
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:46,416
- But you said if there was a problem...
- Of course.

184
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:52,375
I've always thought
you would become a great artist.

185
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,958
Do you still draw, Wilfried?

186
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:01,750
I paint too. Look, self-portraits.
But surely you've surpassed all of us.

187
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:06,500
I'm sure of it. With that talent of yours,
you'll surpass everyone.

188
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:11,125
I've brought you something. A herring.
Here's what this is about.

189
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:18,083
- And those Jews ran away?
- Yes. Here it is. It happened right here.

190
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,125
You really were all alone?

191
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:24,000
Yes, it was just me. It was my first day.
I don't know anyone there.

192
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:29,166
It was an accident.
You're 100 percent sure of that, right?

193
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,208
I swear. He slipped in the mud.

194
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:37,625
Okay, let's have a look.

195
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:43,250
The manhole was the only place we could...
I could think of quickly. You understand?

196
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,208
A blunder, I guess?

197
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,708
Wil.

198
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,958
He's gone.

199
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:02,750
He was here, I swear.

200
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:06,708
The Germans have already found the body.
Oh, Wil.

201
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,166
Come here, the both of you.

202
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:14,583
Listen carefully. If this comes out,

203
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:17,833
you'll end up against the wall.

204
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:26,416
Besides, what you've just done here,
telling me everything,

205
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,125
that makes me an accomplice.

206
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:32,166
Do you understand?

207
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:40,916
Still, I'll do my best to sort something
out with my <i>Freund</i> Gregor. But...

208
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:46,208
of course, I'll want something in return.

209
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:52,375
- We don't have a lot of money.
- Who said anything about money?

210
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:58,500
Your son is a very talented painter.
That can be useful.

211
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:02,166
Besides, he's on the police force.

212
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:08,333
That could be even more useful.
For me, and my <i>Freund</i> Gregor.

213
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:13,458
Do we understand each other?

214
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:17,666
- Yes.
- Agreed.

215
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:21,125
- Yes, mister.
- Yes, we understand each other.

216
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,083
The body was gone.

217
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:02,125
Did you go back?

218
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:06,916
The body was gone.

219
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:12,791
You didn't tell anyone, right?

220
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:17,583
You?

221
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,666
No.

222
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:26,625
And those Jews? Did they get them?

223
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:33,166
Still on the run, apparently.

224
00:24:34,416 --> 00:24:36,125
Says who?

225
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,458
Where did you hear that?

226
00:24:47,416 --> 00:24:49,375
Keep thinking.

227
00:24:50,833 --> 00:24:52,916
It's a dead <i>Feldgendarm.</i>

228
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:57,250
Everyone is looking for him.

229
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:02,125
Our lives depend on it.

230
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:05,500
- Wil saved me.
- How long have you known him?

231
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:09,750
How long does that training take?
I want to know who this Wil is.

232
00:25:09,833 --> 00:25:13,250
Where he lives, who his parents are.

233
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:17,791
And I want him to know
that he's being watched.

234
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:43,958
Thanks for the invite.

235
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:52,333
- And congratulations on the prizes.
- They're not mine, they're the animals'.

236
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,875
Give me your coat.

237
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,875
Go on in.

238
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:07,500
- Ma'am.
- Maria.

239
00:26:08,416 --> 00:26:10,208
I hope you're hungry.

240
00:26:12,416 --> 00:26:13,625
Hello.

241
00:26:13,708 --> 00:26:17,250
Yvette, this is Wilfried.
People call him Wils.

242
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:19,541
He's a friend of Lode's.

243
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:21,583
Most people call me Wil.

244
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:24,208
I imagined you very differently.

245
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,291
Wils.

246
00:26:27,958 --> 00:26:30,291
From the hairdresser on Rotterdamstraat?

247
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:33,541
No, we're not related.
My father works at City Hall.

248
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,250
City Hall?

249
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:40,458
Do you speak German at home?

250
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:44,958
A few words. Like everyone, I suppose.
<i>Ausweis, bitte, Kartoffeln...</i>

251
00:26:45,041 --> 00:26:49,041
Whatever. Sit down.
Or did you shit your pants?

252
00:26:51,291 --> 00:26:52,416
Father.

253
00:26:55,416 --> 00:26:56,666
Dad?

254
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,541
That's enough.

255
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:14,291
Do you have a radio at home?

256
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:20,500
- What stations do you listen to?
- He always grills people.

257
00:27:20,583 --> 00:27:25,500
I'm curious about everyone, boy.
I ask all my customers those questions.

258
00:27:25,583 --> 00:27:28,583
Go on, what stations
do you listen to at home?

259
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:32,166
There isn't much on the radio.

260
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:35,666
Can you recommend something?

261
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:46,125
The only reason you're here
is because we don't trust you.

262
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:51,250
Our lives are in your hands.

263
00:27:51,916 --> 00:27:54,166
And we don't trust you.

264
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:04,625
- So your father works at City Hall.
- Yes.

265
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:06,916
That doesn't really work in your favour.

266
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,625
Who did you tell
you killed that <i>Feldgendarm?</i>

267
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:15,666
I told no one.

268
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,666
How can we be sure of that?

269
00:28:21,125 --> 00:28:23,625
How do I know you can be trusted?

270
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:31,250
We're all in the same boat.

271
00:28:42,875 --> 00:28:44,833
We couldn't help it.

272
00:28:54,708 --> 00:28:56,166
Lode...

273
00:29:17,833 --> 00:29:22,708
If you betray him, I'll slit your throat.

274
00:29:39,791 --> 00:29:43,541
Here it is, Wilfried. Look at this palace.

275
00:29:43,625 --> 00:29:47,916
I have this house by courtesy of a Jew
who had to leave urgently.

276
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,916
But I'm taking care of it,
as a favour to that man.

277
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
And if he comes back?

278
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:59,500
Don't worry about that. My <i>Freund</i> Gregor
says this man won't be back any time soon.

279
00:29:59,583 --> 00:30:05,666
But look at this, Wilfried. In this space,
we can paint as much as we want.

280
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:10,291
Don't you worry. That Jew won't be back.
Certain people know more than others.

281
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,875
- Do you understand?
- I think so.

282
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:17,250
I have to show you something.
Do you know what's important these days?

283
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:21,375
Knowledge. Knowledge and ideals.

284
00:30:21,458 --> 00:30:23,500
I, for example, am an idealist.

285
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:29,041
Since four years before the war, I've been
checking on what's going on in the port

286
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:33,375
and reporting it back to my <i>Freund</i> Gregor.
And that's knowledge.

287
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:39,125
I gave him information, and I received
1,000 francs a month, for four years.

288
00:30:39,208 --> 00:30:43,166
- Were they already involved back then?
- Everyone was asleep.

289
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:48,250
Mind you,
I see an idealist in you too, dear friend.

290
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:52,083
- An idealist, in me?
- Yes, those are the best.

291
00:30:52,166 --> 00:30:55,958
Idealists who don't know
they're idealists.

292
00:30:56,041 --> 00:31:00,541
And with you, there's the added fact
that you're an artist.

293
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:05,458
You have to paint.
Art, my friend, is a struggle.

294
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:07,500
Do you understand?

295
00:31:07,583 --> 00:31:14,291
We have allowed our art to be degenerated
by the Jews for far too long.

296
00:31:14,375 --> 00:31:19,291
And when you've become a celebrated artist
in a country free of Jews,

297
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:23,458
I'll be able to say I discovered you.

298
00:31:23,541 --> 00:31:24,833
Come on.

299
00:31:25,791 --> 00:31:31,583
<i>They are cunning, cowardly and cruel,
and usually appear in massive hordes.</i>

300
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:37,625
<i>They represent the element of insidious,
subterranean destruction among animals.</i>

301
00:31:37,708 --> 00:31:41,041
<i>No different than the Jews among men.</i>

302
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:47,541
<i>Sidelocks and beard, cap and caftan
characterise the Eastern Jew for everyone.</i>

303
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:53,833
<i>If he takes them off, only people with a
sharper eye recognise his racial origin.</i>

304
00:31:53,916 --> 00:31:55,625
<i>His homeland is Asia.</i>

305
00:31:55,708 --> 00:32:00,833
<i>From there, he migrates in crowds via
Russia and the Balkan countries to Europe.</i>

306
00:32:25,041 --> 00:32:29,750
The Israelites are a poison, my friends.

307
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:35,666
How long? How much longer are we
going to have to swallow this poison?

308
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:41,375
Are we a nation that swallows and submits?

309
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:43,666
Or are we a nation of lions?

310
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:46,625
Of lions!

311
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:54,125
A nation that denies its own national
character isn't worthy of nationhood.

312
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:58,625
An Aryan who stands there watching

313
00:32:58,708 --> 00:33:02,666
while his blood and soil are being defiled

314
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:06,208
isn't worthy of being an Aryan.

315
00:33:07,041 --> 00:33:10,500
That's why I say: Jews out!

316
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:15,500
Jews out! Jews out! Jews out!

317
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:31,333
To the synagogue!

318
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:57,125
Throw them out! Throw them out!
Throw them out!

319
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:08,500
A big group is heading to the synagogue.
This is going to end in tragedy.

320
00:34:11,625 --> 00:34:14,125
Everyone, come with me!

321
00:34:29,958 --> 00:34:34,416
Now you're not so tough, are you?
Hey, now you're not so tough, are you?

322
00:34:46,791 --> 00:34:49,833
Would you rather I put something in it?

323
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:13,750
Stop it, guys! They're here!
Stop it! They're coming!

324
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,833
And? Are you watching football?

325
00:35:20,541 --> 00:35:22,333
For fuck's sake!

326
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:25,708
Is there a prize to be won?!

327
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:31,666
Don't say you didn't see anything,
goddammit! Everyone, go home!

328
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:35,375
Everyone, go home, goddammit! Cowards!

329
00:35:53,458 --> 00:35:57,000
Wilfried. My dear friend.

330
00:35:57,083 --> 00:36:01,291
Where did you disappear to?
You missed the best part, goddammit.

331
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:04,250
It was fantastic.

332
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:06,625
Fantastic, my friend.

333
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:11,708
It was fantastic!
You should have been there!

334
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:16,083
Yes, yes, it's done! Mama, it's done!

335
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:19,416
What's going on? Made some new friends?

336
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:03,125
Not here.

337
00:37:04,541 --> 00:37:06,250
I have to show you something.

338
00:37:24,583 --> 00:37:28,583
Lode, calm down! It's not what you think.

339
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:32,750
- Calm down.
- Collaborator!

340
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:51,416
- Will you be calm?
- Collaborator.

341
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,875
I have to show you something. Come.

342
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:09,583
You brought your friend.

343
00:38:10,916 --> 00:38:13,250
Thanks for everything you've done for us.

344
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:17,708
I hid them in the electrical enclosure
and then I brought them here.

345
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:24,208
- How is she?
- She still hasn't said a word.

346
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:30,375
- Did you bring any eggs?
- No, I didn't bring food with me.

347
00:38:30,458 --> 00:38:35,000
Here. Ask them to throw this out.

348
00:38:41,041 --> 00:38:42,333
Thanks.

349
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:54,958
Now I want to know
what happened to the body.

350
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:03,125
We threw him in the Willem dock.

351
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:07,833
We?

352
00:39:09,333 --> 00:39:10,708
With Yvette?

353
00:39:12,666 --> 00:39:14,000
Friends.

354
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:19,458
White Brigade?

355
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:21,291
Friends,

356
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,708
we are all scared.

357
00:39:27,916 --> 00:39:30,791
No one should be ashamed of that.

358
00:39:32,875 --> 00:39:35,291
What we do is important.

359
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:44,041
Even though there's a chance
none of us will be remembered.

360
00:39:45,625 --> 00:39:48,125
Anyway, that's not why we do it.

361
00:39:50,833 --> 00:39:52,875
Our sacrifices are...

362
00:39:54,875 --> 00:39:59,208
a necessity. And so are our fears.
That's it.

363
00:40:00,958 --> 00:40:06,000
In the meantime,
people are being taken away.

364
00:40:09,291 --> 00:40:11,625
And what do we do?

365
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:14,125
We cut wires.

366
00:40:15,208 --> 00:40:17,333
We paint some slogans on walls.

367
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:23,708
Actually, we're a bunch of kids
harassing the Germans a little

368
00:40:23,791 --> 00:40:26,583
instead of fighting them for real.

369
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:34,083
We know there will be raids.

370
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:36,875
We know that.

371
00:40:36,958 --> 00:40:41,291
We don't know when,
we don't know who will be involved,

372
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:46,291
and we absolutely don't know where.
In fact, we know nothing.

373
00:40:47,333 --> 00:40:50,291
But I'm asking you...

374
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:55,833
Are we going to make a difference?

375
00:40:56,666 --> 00:40:59,375
Are we going to save lives?

376
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:14,375
We're happy to see you.

377
00:41:16,333 --> 00:41:17,875
Go ahead.

378
00:41:22,208 --> 00:41:23,875
I'm here for some meat.

379
00:41:24,958 --> 00:41:27,125
Maybe I was wrong about you.

380
00:41:37,416 --> 00:41:39,416
Who are you, Wil?

381
00:41:43,166 --> 00:41:45,833
I'm happy I'm not the chicken, anyway.

382
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:54,375
Tell me, chicken, can you dance?

383
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,375
Can you dance?

384
00:42:18,125 --> 00:42:19,458
Wils.

385
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:28,166
Here. It's not pork.

386
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,333
And a hard-boiled egg.

387
00:42:59,541 --> 00:43:01,541
Ah, Fred Astaire.

388
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:06,041
Be careful, with Yvette.

389
00:43:07,708 --> 00:43:09,958
Do I give such a bad impression?

390
00:43:10,666 --> 00:43:13,500
I'm not talking about you,
I'm talking about her.

391
00:43:15,208 --> 00:43:16,583
Be careful.

392
00:43:17,416 --> 00:43:19,041
She'll hurt you.

393
00:43:36,916 --> 00:43:38,041
Thank you.

394
00:43:49,791 --> 00:43:56,125
<i>Years of childhood
Sweet years of childhood</i>

395
00:43:57,458 --> 00:44:02,208
<i>Forever you will stay in my memory</i>

396
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:08,125
<i>Whenever I think of those years</i>

397
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:12,875
<i>My heart sinks and I feel sad</i>

398
00:44:12,958 --> 00:44:18,416
<i>Oh, how quickly did I become old</i>

399
00:44:19,291 --> 00:44:24,291
<i>In my mind still stands the little house</i>

400
00:44:25,166 --> 00:44:30,541
<i>Where I was born, where I grew up</i>

401
00:44:30,625 --> 00:44:34,500
<i>There I see my cradle</i>

402
00:44:35,375 --> 00:44:38,708
<i>It still stands at its place</i>

403
00:44:39,708 --> 00:44:44,291
<i>All that is faded away like a dream</i>

404
00:45:07,708 --> 00:45:10,583
- I'm here for the brooms.
- Which ones?

405
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:13,666
- The red ones.
- That's upstairs.

406
00:45:39,083 --> 00:45:40,750
They've been informed.

407
00:45:57,666 --> 00:46:01,833
Is this the man you told us about, Bianca?

408
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:07,083
You have to choose a code name.
I'm Valentino.

409
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:09,208
Angelo.

410
00:46:10,458 --> 00:46:12,916
Angelo is a good name for you.

411
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,083
Welcome, Angelo.

412
00:46:16,166 --> 00:46:22,208
I hear you get along really well
with those collaborators at the café.

413
00:46:24,041 --> 00:46:25,833
Well...

414
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:30,291
That's good.
There's nothing wrong with that.

415
00:46:30,375 --> 00:46:35,500
If you hear anything about any raids,
for example, feel free to come to us.

416
00:46:37,958 --> 00:46:41,125
But be careful,
it's a dangerous game with those men.

417
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:45,583
But go ahead and get close to them.

418
00:47:07,208 --> 00:47:11,000
Where was I?
Oh, right, so I say to that Jew:

419
00:47:11,083 --> 00:47:16,625
"This is my time. And yours is over.
Do you understand?"

420
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:20,416
Put that thing back in your pants,
Mr. Verschaffel. Three gins?

421
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:24,125
- Yes.
- A beer for me. I can't hold my liquor.

422
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:27,458
A beer for our artist.
And something for Sus as well.

423
00:47:27,541 --> 00:47:32,458
- Hello, Mr. Verschaffel.
- Sus, a poet. Another discovery of mine.

424
00:47:32,541 --> 00:47:37,583
Sus, for me, is the new Paul van Ostaijen.

425
00:47:37,666 --> 00:47:39,583
I'm not exaggerating.

426
00:47:39,666 --> 00:47:42,041
- Come sit with us.
- Forget it.

427
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:46,416
Go and sit over there, scrounger.
He's a poet that doesn't move his arse.

428
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,291
- Wilfried, this is Jenny.
- Pleasure.

429
00:47:49,375 --> 00:47:50,625
- Likewise.
- The boss.

430
00:47:50,708 --> 00:47:52,666
I'm the flame in his cigar.

431
00:47:53,375 --> 00:47:56,958
- Come on, Jenny.
- That's not a lie, is it, Felix?

432
00:47:57,041 --> 00:48:00,166
Felix is going to arrange
a cigar shop for me.

433
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:02,958
That's what he said.
Someday, when I'm grey.

434
00:48:03,041 --> 00:48:08,000
- Patience, my dear. That shop will happen.
- The next raid. You promised.

435
00:48:08,083 --> 00:48:11,291
She's expensive. A woman costs a fortune.

436
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:13,875
Come here, let me take a look at you.

437
00:48:15,958 --> 00:48:17,750
- Omer?
- Yes?

438
00:48:17,833 --> 00:48:21,750
- I believe you know Wilfried.
- Ah, the painter.

439
00:48:21,833 --> 00:48:25,083
Wilfried, this is Omer Verschueren.
Notary.

440
00:48:25,166 --> 00:48:28,666
Why don't you ask Wilfried
to paint your portrait?

441
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:33,125
- Do you also paint portraits?
- I do. They're the hardest, though.

442
00:48:33,208 --> 00:48:36,166
- A gin for me.
- Wilfried...

443
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:39,083
Irma, a double shot of gin
for Mr. Vingerhoets.

444
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,375
Come and join us, Eduard.

445
00:48:45,583 --> 00:48:49,750
What's that traitor doing here?
Who brought him in here?

446
00:48:49,833 --> 00:48:53,083
- Does it matter?
- What has the boy done wrong?

447
00:48:53,166 --> 00:48:58,833
Listen, he's one of us.
This lad is one of ours. What the hell?

448
00:49:01,791 --> 00:49:03,083
Thanks, Irma.

449
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:08,041
During our march on the synagogue,
this traitor gave the alarm.

450
00:49:08,125 --> 00:49:11,166
He couldn't run to the station
fast enough to snitch.

451
00:49:11,958 --> 00:49:15,416
I feared accidents would happen.
I thought I needed to report it.

452
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:26,333
Come on, Eduard, the boy was just doing
what he thought was his duty.

453
00:49:26,416 --> 00:49:30,000
Duty, my arse! Are you defending him?

454
00:49:32,041 --> 00:49:35,958
How long has he worked for the police?
He doesn't know anything yet.

455
00:49:36,041 --> 00:49:37,625
He doesn't?

456
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:40,166
And how about you, Verschaffel?

457
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:43,125
Maybe you sent him to the station
to sabotage us.

458
00:49:43,208 --> 00:49:45,250
- Come on, Eduard.
- Calm down a little.

459
00:49:45,333 --> 00:49:47,083
Watch your mouth, man.

460
00:49:48,958 --> 00:49:50,458
Watch your mouth.

461
00:49:52,708 --> 00:49:54,666
We'll see what Gregor has to say.

462
00:49:54,750 --> 00:50:01,208
My <i>Freund</i> Gregor will laugh in your face.
For sure.

463
00:50:01,291 --> 00:50:03,666
- Easy, guys.
- For sure!

464
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,500
- Guys.
- For sure!

465
00:50:05,583 --> 00:50:10,750
Felix, calm down.
Be careful what you divulge to Gregor.

466
00:50:11,791 --> 00:50:14,291
Gregor is a strange one, Felix.

467
00:50:17,541 --> 00:50:22,166
Nobody sent me to the station,
least of all Mr. Verschaffel.

468
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:27,000
I admit, I should have prepared Wilfried
a little better for what could happen.

469
00:50:27,083 --> 00:50:30,500
It's true. He has a poetic soul,
he doesn't know any better.

470
00:50:30,583 --> 00:50:33,083
With his dirty sketches. "Poetic soul."

471
00:50:33,166 --> 00:50:37,166
If someone knows about dirty,
it's you, Mr. Dirty Finger.

472
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:42,291
I can't believe they keep calling him
the Finger, with a nose like that.

473
00:50:42,375 --> 00:50:47,833
That says enough. Or shall we tell
who you really are? Are you kidding me?

474
00:50:47,916 --> 00:50:50,916
Come on! Everyone, drink!

475
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,083
To the naivety of youngsters!
May they do a lot of stupid things.

476
00:50:55,166 --> 00:50:58,250
- You should do a lot of stupid things.
- Cheers!

477
00:50:58,333 --> 00:51:01,333
- Come on, let's go shoot.
- Cover your ears.

478
00:51:01,416 --> 00:51:02,750
Don't do it.

479
00:51:03,833 --> 00:51:07,500
For fuck's sake!
Go do that outside, shitheads!

480
00:51:07,583 --> 00:51:10,291
- I'd better go.
- Show-off.

481
00:51:12,583 --> 00:51:14,000
Pour me another.

482
00:51:44,666 --> 00:51:48,625
This is an address book.
It was hidden in a vase.

483
00:51:51,958 --> 00:51:56,333
Gregor Schnabel,
<i>Obersekretär, Geheime Feldpolizei.</i>

484
00:51:56,416 --> 00:51:57,916
Two phone numbers.

485
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,291
"My <i>Freund</i> Gregor."
Are those his German contacts?

486
00:52:02,375 --> 00:52:06,625
- Yes, but there are also some local names.
- Collaborators?

487
00:52:06,708 --> 00:52:10,416
Yes, many people we know,
but a few surprising names as well.

488
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:13,291
You cosying up to Beard Man
wasn't such a bad idea.

489
00:52:13,375 --> 00:52:17,416
Look here. Title deeds to seven houses
in the Jewish quarter.

490
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,083
More than seven houses.

491
00:52:19,166 --> 00:52:24,083
All for next to nothing.
And all from notary Omer Verschueren.

492
00:52:24,166 --> 00:52:25,708
There are more.

493
00:52:29,208 --> 00:52:30,708
A cigar shop.

494
00:52:30,791 --> 00:52:33,625
Beard Man promised Jenny a cigar shop.

495
00:52:34,833 --> 00:52:38,333
{\an8}- Rijfstraat.
- Is that one among those deeds?

496
00:52:41,666 --> 00:52:43,291
- Have a good look.
- No.

497
00:52:45,083 --> 00:52:47,000
She hasn't got her shop yet.

498
00:52:48,375 --> 00:52:50,458
After the next raid, he said.

499
00:52:53,333 --> 00:52:55,458
We have to continue looking.

500
00:52:57,750 --> 00:52:58,916
Hold on.

501
00:53:10,041 --> 00:53:13,916
Did you leave the lights on again?

502
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,416
You're crazy. You do that every time.

503
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,625
I'll put a record on.

504
00:54:00,083 --> 00:54:05,833
Come on, Will, come on! Yeehaa!
Over the puddle!

505
00:54:34,875 --> 00:54:39,000
No, please don't stop. Please.

506
00:54:56,791 --> 00:54:59,708
Come, Wil. Let's go, boy.

507
00:55:01,958 --> 00:55:07,291
Ah, our deputy. Congratulations.
I'm very happy for you, Finger.

508
00:55:07,375 --> 00:55:09,958
Did everyone understand the orders?

509
00:55:10,041 --> 00:55:14,208
Close off the streets,
let no one in or out, and nothing more.

510
00:55:14,291 --> 00:55:16,625
And don't interfere in their business.

511
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:38,500
The Jews have obviously been warned.

512
00:55:40,375 --> 00:55:42,083
Fuck.

513
00:55:42,166 --> 00:55:44,208
And a long time in advance.

514
00:55:46,958 --> 00:55:49,041
That means we have a rat.

515
00:55:50,416 --> 00:55:55,666
My unit only received their orders
an hour ago.

516
00:55:56,541 --> 00:55:58,875
Apart from that,

517
00:55:59,708 --> 00:56:03,916
nobody was told a single word
about the plan.

518
00:56:07,208 --> 00:56:13,458
The only three people who knew
were me, Felix Verschaffel, and you.

519
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:21,750
I'll find the rat and deliver them to you.

520
00:56:21,833 --> 00:56:23,958
I hope so for your sake.

521
00:56:25,291 --> 00:56:27,250
Don't disappoint me again.

522
00:57:22,458 --> 00:57:24,291
We're off now.

523
00:59:50,333 --> 00:59:52,750
Come here, my godson.

524
00:59:52,833 --> 00:59:55,708
Are you two together? Introduce me.

525
00:59:55,791 --> 00:59:59,333
- This is Yvette, and this is Aunt Emma.
- Hello.

526
00:59:59,416 --> 01:00:02,291
You're a pretty young thing.

527
01:00:02,375 --> 01:00:06,833
Come, I want to introduce you to someone.
Aren't you thirsty?

528
01:00:06,916 --> 01:00:08,500
Come on, follow me.

529
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:22,333
Wil, come on, let's get a drink.

530
01:00:32,083 --> 01:00:33,500
Honey.

531
01:00:40,958 --> 01:00:42,250
Honey.

532
01:00:43,041 --> 01:00:46,625
This is my nephew Wilfried,
and his Yvette.

533
01:00:50,458 --> 01:00:56,625
Delighted. Please do me a favour
and go sit on the couch.

534
01:01:02,666 --> 01:01:04,083
We know each other.

535
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:14,666
Your hair is gorgeous.
Tell Aunt Emma your secret.

536
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:19,208
This is really an incredible coincidence,
isn't it?

537
01:01:19,291 --> 01:01:23,041
Do you want anything?
Champagne? Schnapps? No?

538
01:01:24,541 --> 01:01:27,666
What's the matter? You seem a bit tense.

539
01:01:29,958 --> 01:01:32,708
Forgive me, I don't want to embarrass you.

540
01:01:32,791 --> 01:01:37,000
I am and remain your occupier
and I apologise for that,

541
01:01:37,083 --> 01:01:39,416
but I am not your enemy.

542
01:01:42,708 --> 01:01:45,000
And it wasn't my intention,

543
01:01:45,083 --> 01:01:51,458
but your wonderful Aunt Emma and I
have fallen head over heels in love.

544
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:54,666
This woman just drives me crazy.

545
01:01:55,416 --> 01:02:00,791
Anyway, if you ever get
into any difficulties...

546
01:02:15,625 --> 01:02:18,833
A representative
of the Antwerp police force.

547
01:02:21,458 --> 01:02:23,291
No schnapps for me.

548
01:02:29,666 --> 01:02:30,875
Well...

549
01:02:32,833 --> 01:02:37,125
One, two, three... Bottom's up!

550
01:02:43,708 --> 01:02:46,541
These Antwerp policemen are real athletes.

551
01:02:46,625 --> 01:02:48,458
Wil, shall we go for a dance?

552
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:57,000
You're among friends here.
And when you're one of us, you drink.

553
01:02:58,166 --> 01:03:02,541
If you don't, you're not one of us.
Sorry, it may sound a bit boorish to you,

554
01:03:02,625 --> 01:03:05,375
but it's that simple among soldiers.

555
01:03:05,458 --> 01:03:08,875
Who drinks, is a comrade.

556
01:03:08,958 --> 01:03:15,250
Who doesn't drink, is a fucking milk rat.
And I hate milk rats!

557
01:03:36,666 --> 01:03:40,916
Please do drink something.
You're so incredibly tense.

558
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,416
A milk rat!

559
01:03:43,416 --> 01:03:45,333
Hold on...

560
01:03:45,416 --> 01:03:48,791
Gregor, don't do that to the boy.
You're so naughty.

561
01:03:48,875 --> 01:03:51,958
Angel, that is not a boy.

562
01:03:52,958 --> 01:03:56,000
That is a real man.

563
01:04:14,041 --> 01:04:19,291
- Very good. Very, very good.
- And now we're really getting started.

564
01:04:21,833 --> 01:04:25,333
One, two, three... Bottom's up.

565
01:04:27,916 --> 01:04:31,041
One, two, three...

566
01:04:31,125 --> 01:04:32,583
Bottom's up!

567
01:04:36,416 --> 01:04:38,333
Stop it.

568
01:04:48,083 --> 01:04:49,541
Wil?

569
01:05:10,916 --> 01:05:14,166
How are things at work?
Everything alright?

570
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:21,458
Your aunt told me a wild story about
your first day at the police station.

571
01:05:21,541 --> 01:05:27,958
You came home in the middle of the night
with your uniform covered in mud,

572
01:05:28,041 --> 01:05:30,791
and that of your colleague too, I assume.

573
01:05:30,875 --> 01:05:36,250
As I told your aunt,
the real story behind it,

574
01:05:37,291 --> 01:05:39,125
that's what I want to hear.

575
01:05:40,708 --> 01:05:43,833
I'm sure it's very amusing.

576
01:05:44,666 --> 01:05:46,708
Hilarious even.

577
01:05:54,666 --> 01:05:56,416
I have to pee.

578
01:06:03,791 --> 01:06:05,000
Wil...

579
01:06:13,083 --> 01:06:14,333
Wil!

580
01:06:16,625 --> 01:06:18,083
Look at his face.

581
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:23,291
Look who's here.

582
01:06:25,583 --> 01:06:29,375
- Fuck off.
- Having a piss with your teeny pee-pee.

583
01:06:29,458 --> 01:06:32,666
You're pissing me off.
I'm not going to ask again. Fuck off!

584
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:36,125
"Fuck off, fuck off."
You have a big mouth.

585
01:06:36,208 --> 01:06:38,458
You have a big mouth, mate,

586
01:06:38,541 --> 01:06:43,750
but really, you're just a puppet
for Verschaffel to play with.

587
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:41,291
Wil. Wil! Stop it, Wil!

588
01:07:42,916 --> 01:07:45,541
Wil!

589
01:08:14,583 --> 01:08:20,416
Well? Are you proud of what you've done?
Do you have a death wish or something?

590
01:08:21,541 --> 01:08:25,500
- Explain yourself.
- Emma said you were provoking SS men.

591
01:08:25,583 --> 01:08:28,708
Don't you remember? Let me remind you.

592
01:08:28,791 --> 01:08:32,541
You were drunk
and knocked someone into the hospital!

593
01:08:32,625 --> 01:08:34,708
A friend of Mr. Verschaffel's!

594
01:08:34,791 --> 01:08:37,541
Don't talk to me about Verschaffel.

595
01:08:37,625 --> 01:08:40,208
Don't you know how much we owe him?

596
01:08:40,291 --> 01:08:43,916
I only know you kiss his arse
and he now expects me to do the same.

597
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,833
- You ungrateful dog.
- Come on, man!

598
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:51,416
Have some respect for your father!

599
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Emma told us it was disgusting
and that you were talking trash!

600
01:09:00,125 --> 01:09:03,375
Red light, green light!

601
01:09:20,375 --> 01:09:23,125
BUTCHER'S SHOP
FRANS METDEPENNINGEN

602
01:09:28,708 --> 01:09:30,708
You don't remember what you said.

603
01:09:31,708 --> 01:09:33,250
Do you?

604
01:09:41,041 --> 01:09:42,500
You,

605
01:09:43,708 --> 01:09:46,125
in front of all those Germans...

606
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,916
yelled that you'd throw Sus
in the Willem dock

607
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,916
and that there was still room
next to that dead officer.

608
01:10:01,208 --> 01:10:03,666
If they drag the dock, we're doomed.

609
01:10:04,583 --> 01:10:05,958
All of us.

610
01:10:13,666 --> 01:10:16,750
It's possible
they didn't understand your babbling.

611
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:22,750
- But they may connect the dots.
- Jean can connect the dots.

612
01:10:23,875 --> 01:10:26,416
He saw us with that <i>Feldgendarm.</i>

613
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:30,375
They've got us.

614
01:10:31,416 --> 01:10:36,750
- We have to go into hiding.
- I've had enough. This'll get us nowhere.

615
01:10:36,833 --> 01:10:41,416
Lode, put on your uniform
and go to work. Come on.

616
01:10:42,041 --> 01:10:43,208
You too.

617
01:10:44,916 --> 01:10:47,958
Come on, Maurice, pull yourself together.

618
01:10:48,041 --> 01:10:50,791
Pull yourself together, I said. Come on.

619
01:11:10,708 --> 01:11:12,541
You weren't there for me.

620
01:11:39,291 --> 01:11:40,541
Come with me.

621
01:11:59,666 --> 01:12:03,000
There he is, the man of the hour.

622
01:12:04,208 --> 01:12:09,041
The wild beast.
The biggest drinker in Antwerp.

623
01:12:10,416 --> 01:12:13,041
Did you sleep well? Hungover?

624
01:12:15,041 --> 01:12:17,875
Don't just stand there, come on up.
Come up.

625
01:12:22,375 --> 01:12:26,708
How well do you know your local history?

626
01:12:26,791 --> 01:12:31,958
Did you know that the Willem dock was
commissioned in 1803 by Napoleon himself,

627
01:12:32,041 --> 01:12:35,750
but was only put into operation
ten years later? Did you know that?

628
01:12:37,166 --> 01:12:41,750
And did you also know that it isn't
as deep as one might expect?

629
01:12:41,833 --> 01:12:45,041
Only six metres. No current.

630
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:51,500
Why am I telling you this?
I want to show you something.

631
01:12:53,791 --> 01:12:59,541
We found this in the jacket
of a murdered officer.

632
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:01,458
His orders.

633
01:13:01,541 --> 01:13:07,583
As you can see, he was on his way
to arrest some people who refused to work.

634
01:13:07,666 --> 01:13:13,541
And you know the rules. For that he needed
to request a police escort. Come here.

635
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:18,666
From your police station.
Do you know anything about this?

636
01:13:25,166 --> 01:13:27,625
Why did you stop? Come with me.

637
01:13:29,125 --> 01:13:33,291
And there's something else
I'd like to show you, if I may.

638
01:14:09,458 --> 01:14:13,666
Do you know how disappointing it is for me
that this body was found?

639
01:14:14,541 --> 01:14:18,875
The murder case was closed.
The atonement was made.

640
01:14:18,958 --> 01:14:21,375
The communists were punished.

641
01:14:21,458 --> 01:14:25,416
But now I have to start
the investigation from scratch.

642
01:14:27,125 --> 01:14:32,333
But anyway, that's my role in this story.

643
01:14:33,833 --> 01:14:36,458
I don't know yet what your role in it is.

644
01:14:37,791 --> 01:14:39,208
Maybe you do?

645
01:14:41,333 --> 01:14:42,916
Come.

646
01:15:16,083 --> 01:15:17,833
Our milkman.

647
01:15:20,375 --> 01:15:21,750
Take a seat.

648
01:15:26,208 --> 01:15:28,625
Your colleague still denies

649
01:15:28,708 --> 01:15:33,083
that the murdered <i>Feldgendarm</i>
presented himself at your station.

650
01:15:34,625 --> 01:15:36,208
Do you believe him?

651
01:15:40,708 --> 01:15:41,958
We don't.

652
01:15:59,625 --> 01:16:03,083
The <i>Feldgendarm</i> was seen
on the way to your station.

653
01:16:04,583 --> 01:16:07,875
Not by us. Not our station.

654
01:16:24,041 --> 01:16:27,666
At your station, nobody saw him alive.

655
01:16:28,583 --> 01:16:31,666
But you knew

656
01:16:32,916 --> 01:16:35,291
that his body was in the Willem dock.

657
01:16:37,958 --> 01:16:39,666
I was drunk.

658
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:45,416
And yet, your tip was spot on. How come?

659
01:16:50,833 --> 01:16:55,791
- I heard it somewhere.
- Heard it. Good. From whom?

660
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:58,791
From him?

661
01:17:21,583 --> 01:17:24,083
Is there anything
you would like to tell me now?

662
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:29,666
No?

663
01:17:30,958 --> 01:17:32,333
Come with me.

664
01:17:40,125 --> 01:17:43,208
Who saw the <i>Feldgendarm?</i> You or him?

665
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:45,166
You or him?

666
01:17:45,250 --> 01:17:46,833
Or the both of you?

667
01:18:12,583 --> 01:18:15,958
<i>I saw two bears...</i>

668
01:18:16,041 --> 01:18:18,333
<i>...butter like that</i>

669
01:18:28,375 --> 01:18:32,583
<i>I was standing there and looked at it</i>

670
01:19:04,166 --> 01:19:05,875
Jean didn't do anything.

671
01:19:07,583 --> 01:19:11,583
It's good to see you protect each other.
Trust me, it has value.

672
01:19:11,666 --> 01:19:17,791
- I'm not protecting him, I believe him.
- It doesn't matter whether it was Jean.

673
01:19:19,166 --> 01:19:23,375
We wanted to get rid of him anyway
and this was a welcome pretence.

674
01:19:23,458 --> 01:19:27,291
But shall I tell you
why you are still here?

675
01:19:27,375 --> 01:19:30,666
We've noticed some officers
have joined the Resistance.

676
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:33,541
The men of the White Brigade.

677
01:19:33,625 --> 01:19:36,500
Do you happen to have contact
with any of these men?

678
01:19:36,583 --> 01:19:38,625
I'm telling the truth.

679
01:19:40,916 --> 01:19:46,541
I am not entirely convinced. But I am
prepared to continue playing along.

680
01:19:51,166 --> 01:19:53,458
Your friend...

681
01:19:54,333 --> 01:19:55,666
Yvette.

682
01:19:56,666 --> 01:19:58,083
Right?

683
01:19:59,083 --> 01:20:01,916
She really is a...

684
01:20:03,416 --> 01:20:05,458
very beautiful woman.

685
01:20:06,333 --> 01:20:09,166
A knockout on the dance floor.

686
01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:14,041
I heard she's the sister
of your colleague Metdepenningen.

687
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:24,208
Does he, maybe, know anything about
what happened to the <i>Feldgendarm?</i>

688
01:20:29,916 --> 01:20:32,083
I like you.

689
01:20:34,125 --> 01:20:35,500
I think.

690
01:20:36,458 --> 01:20:39,541
And I'm trying to help you.

691
01:20:40,583 --> 01:20:42,875
You have a nice family.

692
01:20:43,708 --> 01:20:45,833
You have a lovely girlfriend.

693
01:20:47,166 --> 01:20:51,083
And if you and her want to have a future,

694
01:20:51,166 --> 01:20:54,375
then it's time you took sides.

695
01:21:00,208 --> 01:21:03,291
Jean has been arrested.

696
01:21:03,375 --> 01:21:06,291
All I know
is that he went looking for trouble.

697
01:21:06,375 --> 01:21:08,291
Gust is right.

698
01:21:08,375 --> 01:21:11,833
If you're against authority,
you shouldn't work for the police.

699
01:21:11,916 --> 01:21:14,833
You mean he wasn't collaborating enough.

700
01:21:14,916 --> 01:21:16,375
Anyway...

701
01:21:18,291 --> 01:21:22,541
If there's someone here
who can exonerate Jean,

702
01:21:22,625 --> 01:21:24,083
or the opposite,

703
01:21:25,208 --> 01:21:28,166
then now is the time to speak up.

704
01:22:06,125 --> 01:22:10,625
Take a seat, kid. Over there.
On that chair.

705
01:22:28,875 --> 01:22:30,750
Here he is.

706
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:34,750
The prodigal son.

707
01:22:38,083 --> 01:22:40,416
You know that parable, right?

708
01:22:43,583 --> 01:22:47,625
- Mr. Versch...
- Shall we get real?

709
01:22:47,708 --> 01:22:49,500
Our side

710
01:22:50,625 --> 01:22:52,666
is winning.

711
01:22:53,625 --> 01:22:56,583
My time is winning.

712
01:22:59,458 --> 01:23:02,875
And what do you do?
You give yourself away.

713
01:23:02,958 --> 01:23:04,833
And you give me away.

714
01:23:07,125 --> 01:23:10,375
Do you know what that does to me?
You could have been my son.

715
01:23:11,541 --> 01:23:14,916
Do you understand? No.

716
01:23:16,333 --> 01:23:18,791
You don't get it. Very well...

717
01:23:25,375 --> 01:23:27,666
I'm going to give you one more chance.

718
01:23:29,291 --> 01:23:34,541
A real opportunity
for a real opportunist like you.

719
01:23:34,625 --> 01:23:39,416
This is your last chance
to mend your ways.

720
01:23:50,791 --> 01:23:53,000
Kill those rats.

721
01:23:57,250 --> 01:24:01,708
Kill that rat for me.
Kill that Jewish woman,

722
01:24:01,791 --> 01:24:08,041
that stinking filthy rat, for me.
You are going to kill them, for me!

723
01:28:10,583 --> 01:28:12,125
Dance.

724
01:28:18,291 --> 01:28:20,083
A soft landing.

725
01:28:30,458 --> 01:28:32,666
Guys, we're going to climb mountains.

726
01:29:31,125 --> 01:29:35,750
This person was pulled
from the train to Brussels.

727
01:29:35,833 --> 01:29:39,333
He had a Belgian ID card,
a pretty good forgery,

728
01:29:39,416 --> 01:29:41,583
but he was circumcised.

729
01:29:41,666 --> 01:29:43,125
A Jew.

730
01:29:43,916 --> 01:29:45,833
His real name was Lizke.

731
01:29:58,791 --> 01:30:00,208
Come with me.

732
01:30:03,375 --> 01:30:06,500
By chance, we had just arrested
the forger.

733
01:30:07,458 --> 01:30:14,458
It took him less than a minute to betray
the person who had commissioned him.

734
01:30:30,041 --> 01:30:33,500
Do you happen to know someone

735
01:30:33,583 --> 01:30:35,833
called Valentino?

736
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:41,291
Or who is known as Valentino? No?

737
01:30:43,416 --> 01:30:45,625
And what about Bianca?

738
01:30:46,375 --> 01:30:48,166
Still no.

739
01:30:48,250 --> 01:30:50,458
And Angelo?

740
01:30:56,833 --> 01:30:58,500
Angelo.

741
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:01,583
Get me out of here.

742
01:31:01,666 --> 01:31:03,416
Angelo?

743
01:31:04,791 --> 01:31:09,416
You... Get me out of here, kid.

744
01:31:13,250 --> 01:31:17,083
- He doesn't know what he's saying.
- Stop insulting me any further.

745
01:31:21,083 --> 01:31:23,291
You are Angelo.

746
01:31:23,375 --> 01:31:26,416
The butcher's son is Valentino.

747
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:30,416
And Bianca, I've seen her dance, right?

748
01:31:58,333 --> 01:32:01,416
- What do you want from me?
- Let me explain.

749
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:06,458
I'll make sure that you, your beloved,
and your family survive this.

750
01:32:06,541 --> 01:32:11,750
But for that, you'll have to help me.
You understand? How does that sound?

751
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:29,583
Did you really believe that I was
actually interested in your aunt?

752
01:32:33,416 --> 01:32:37,083
Did you think I didn't know
Jews were hiding in that wine cellar?

753
01:32:38,916 --> 01:32:42,625
Just as I predicted,
everything is connected here.

754
01:32:46,833 --> 01:32:50,500
You want to save your life
and that of your family.

755
01:32:50,583 --> 01:32:52,875
That makes you a real man.

756
01:32:52,958 --> 01:32:56,041
Who knows what it means
to sacrifice things.

757
01:32:56,916 --> 01:33:01,333
Who knows what it means to protect someone
and knows it's a dirty business.

758
01:33:01,416 --> 01:33:04,250
And when you understand that,

759
01:33:04,333 --> 01:33:10,291
then one day, you can look in the mirror
and see a real man.

760
01:33:13,208 --> 01:33:15,125
You have to choose.

761
01:33:16,208 --> 01:33:17,708
So...

762
01:33:20,041 --> 01:33:21,458
what will it be?

763
01:34:07,166 --> 01:34:09,041
You're still alive.

764
01:34:27,333 --> 01:34:29,166
Lizke is dead.

765
01:34:38,583 --> 01:34:40,416
Myriam is dead.

766
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:43,541
The little one as well, probably.

767
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,833
They have the Professor.

768
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:56,666
The Germans know everything.

769
01:34:56,750 --> 01:34:59,375
They beat it all out of the Professor.

770
01:35:02,375 --> 01:35:05,750
It's over. It's finished.

771
01:35:07,666 --> 01:35:09,958
Possibly, yes.

772
01:35:14,208 --> 01:35:16,458
But we can survive this.

773
01:35:19,250 --> 01:35:22,791
Gregor wants me to give you
and the rest of the Resistance

774
01:35:24,333 --> 01:35:26,375
false information.

775
01:35:28,625 --> 01:35:30,458
There's a raid on Saturday.

776
01:35:30,541 --> 01:35:34,375
And he wants us to pass on
a wrong neighbourhood to the Jews.

777
01:35:34,458 --> 01:35:37,416
We have to find out
where the raid will really take place.

778
01:35:39,291 --> 01:35:41,000
I already know.

779
01:35:41,958 --> 01:35:44,125
I know the right address.

780
01:35:46,583 --> 01:35:50,125
But if I give that address, we're dead.

781
01:35:57,625 --> 01:35:59,208
Give me the address.

782
01:36:03,708 --> 01:36:08,375
I would never, never ever forgive myself.

783
01:36:08,458 --> 01:36:10,458
Do you understand?

784
01:36:10,541 --> 01:36:12,208
Give me the address.

785
01:36:16,333 --> 01:36:18,333
I don't care about dying.

786
01:36:20,333 --> 01:36:23,458
I wanted to put the choice
to the both of you.

787
01:36:24,583 --> 01:36:26,916
Because you can't decide yourself.

788
01:36:28,750 --> 01:36:31,041
Because this is about survival.

789
01:36:37,166 --> 01:36:39,083
A conscience is a luxury.

790
01:36:48,583 --> 01:36:52,500
Is that what you're going to tell
your child?

791
01:37:01,458 --> 01:37:02,833
Because

792
01:37:04,083 --> 01:37:05,708
I won't.

793
01:37:12,583 --> 01:37:14,541
I'd rather die.

794
01:37:15,541 --> 01:37:17,291
Give me the address.

795
01:37:21,291 --> 01:37:22,958
Pelikaanstraat.

796
01:37:33,208 --> 01:37:34,541
Yvette.

797
01:37:37,416 --> 01:37:38,958
Stay here.

798
01:37:42,625 --> 01:37:44,000
Let her go.

799
01:37:48,916 --> 01:37:50,708
We're going to survive this.

800
01:37:53,750 --> 01:37:56,000
We're going to survive this.

801
01:37:59,375 --> 01:38:03,291
- It's Pelikaanstraat.
- I was told Terliststraat.

802
01:38:03,375 --> 01:38:07,208
No. That's what they want us to believe,
but it's Pelikaanstraat.

803
01:38:07,291 --> 01:38:12,291
- Someone leaked it to the Professor.
- We got it from the <i>Geheime Feldpolizei.</i>

804
01:38:12,375 --> 01:38:14,291
From Gregor Schnabel himself.

805
01:38:16,625 --> 01:38:19,333
Make sure the Jews know, goddammit.

806
01:38:28,333 --> 01:38:30,000
I don't want to do this.

807
01:38:31,041 --> 01:38:33,750
Me neither. So?

808
01:38:49,541 --> 01:38:53,041
Change of plans.
The Germans aren't coming.

809
01:38:54,708 --> 01:38:58,958
City Hall gave us orders
to take over the operation.

810
01:38:59,041 --> 01:39:01,958
And the raid will be moved
to the Terliststraat.

811
01:39:02,041 --> 01:39:06,333
We pull the Jews from their houses and
throw them on the truck. Is that clear?

812
01:39:07,375 --> 01:39:09,000
One more thing.

813
01:39:09,083 --> 01:39:12,458
With no Germans present
the Jews probably won't cooperate.

814
01:39:12,541 --> 01:39:14,625
We'll see about that.

815
01:39:14,708 --> 01:39:18,250
That's right, Gust.
They'd better not give us a hard time.

816
01:39:18,333 --> 01:39:22,500
We won't let them push us around.
Understood? Dismissed.

817
01:39:22,583 --> 01:39:24,500
Are we going to do this?

818
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:28,166
Then we'll have to keep doing this.

819
01:39:31,333 --> 01:39:33,250
If we don't do this...

820
01:39:35,583 --> 01:39:37,083
then what?

821
01:39:40,250 --> 01:39:41,500
Come on.

822
01:39:43,333 --> 01:39:46,083
All the Jews on the truck! Faster!

823
01:39:47,458 --> 01:39:50,541
- Faster!
- Get out. No dawdling.

824
01:39:56,291 --> 01:39:58,750
Outside. Come on. On the truck.

825
01:40:00,625 --> 01:40:03,625
- Let's grab those rats.
- Hurry up!

826
01:40:11,208 --> 01:40:14,458
Come quietly. Don't make it difficult.

827
01:40:14,541 --> 01:40:19,875
Come on, man. Pull up your trousers.
Pull up your trousers, man.

828
01:40:19,958 --> 01:40:23,041
Come on. Come with me, goddammit.

829
01:40:23,125 --> 01:40:26,666
Wils, Metdepenningen,
what the fuck are you gawking at?

830
01:40:26,750 --> 01:40:28,708
- Do your part.
- Get up there.

831
01:40:28,791 --> 01:40:29,958
Dammit.

832
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,291
Get on!

833
01:40:36,416 --> 01:40:39,375
What's your problem?
What are you waiting for?

834
01:41:02,875 --> 01:41:07,291
Hey, Wils. Look at this. Goddammit.

835
01:41:07,375 --> 01:41:10,250
This is worth a drawing, isn't it?
Come on.

836
01:41:14,250 --> 01:41:19,541
Move it! If you don't do anything now,
I'll throw you both under the truck.

837
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:32,250
To the truck. Come on!

838
01:41:33,958 --> 01:41:36,708
I've had enough of this!

839
01:41:36,791 --> 01:41:41,041
- Stop complaining.
- I'm going mad. Get off me!

840
01:41:48,291 --> 01:41:49,875
Come on, get up there!

841
01:41:50,666 --> 01:41:52,625
- No.
- Get on!

842
01:41:58,916 --> 01:42:03,041
Good job. There are more rats upstairs.

843
01:42:09,708 --> 01:42:11,708
Come on. Come on!

844
01:42:18,958 --> 01:42:20,541
Upstairs.

845
01:43:13,125 --> 01:43:14,916
I can't do this.

846
01:43:15,833 --> 01:43:19,375
I can't do this. This can't be.

847
01:43:25,625 --> 01:43:28,958
- Gaston, put those kids on the truck.
- I can't!

848
01:43:29,041 --> 01:43:31,666
Put those kids on the truck!

849
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,916
Here, take the little one.
Do you have her?

850
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:46,708
No, leave them here.
Leave them here, please. Please.

851
01:43:46,791 --> 01:43:48,416
You fat coward!

852
01:44:02,208 --> 01:44:04,625
- Take the little one.
- On the truck!

853
01:44:05,916 --> 01:44:07,125
Come on!

854
01:44:18,458 --> 01:44:22,333
There's plenty of room. Get on!

855
01:44:23,291 --> 01:44:24,166
Get on!

856
01:44:27,250 --> 01:44:30,875
Push them on. There's plenty of room.

857
01:44:48,541 --> 01:44:52,916
Wil, where are you going?! Traitor!

858
01:45:10,166 --> 01:45:11,458
Yvette?

859
01:45:13,208 --> 01:45:14,583
Yvette!

860
01:46:58,083 --> 01:47:01,208
<i>And afterwards,
people kept their mouths shut.</i>

861
01:47:02,833 --> 01:47:05,583
<i>And yesterday immediately became history.</i>

862
01:47:07,041 --> 01:47:11,041
<i>Because you have to move on.
That's what they said.</i>

863
01:47:11,125 --> 01:47:12,916
<i>There's no other way.</i>

864
01:47:13,583 --> 01:47:15,208
<i>And it's true.</i>

865
01:47:16,916 --> 01:47:18,583
<i>There's no other way.</i>

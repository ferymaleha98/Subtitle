00:00:10.667 --> 00:00:11.668
I don't want to go, Mom.

2
00:00:11.708 --> 00:00:13.585
-Come on!
-I love you, Mom.

3
00:00:13.625 --> 00:00:18.560
-Mommy!
-Come on!

4
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.350
Mommy! Open the door!

5
00:00:22.123 --> 00:00:25.735
Mommy! Open the door!

6
00:00:29.417 --> 00:00:31.774
Mommy!

7
00:00:31.814 --> 00:00:35.064
-Who's going to help you now?
-Mommy!

8
00:00:41.167 --> 00:00:43.960
Damn you! What are you going to do?

9
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.835
-Pervert! Jerk!
-Mommy!

10
00:00:46.875 --> 00:00:49.528
-Mercy me, Mom!
-Stupid!

11
00:00:49.568 --> 00:00:51.735
-What are you going to be?
-Mercy me, Mom!

12
00:00:53.625 --> 00:00:55.596
-Mercy me, Mom!
-Damn you!

13
00:00:55.636 --> 00:00:57.918
-Mercy me, Mom!
-What are you going to do?

14
00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:02.210
-What are you going to be?
-Mercy me, Mom!

15
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.502
Mercy me, Mom!

16
00:01:04.542 --> 00:01:07.000
What are you going to be? Eat this!

17
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:10.627
You faggot!

18
00:01:10.667 --> 00:01:15.625
=4 Mantan=

19
00:04:33.583 --> 00:04:36.333
Murderer!

20
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.043
-Hello?
-Hello. Sar, you should know that...

21
00:04:56.083 --> 00:04:58.500
That Alex passed away, Sar!

22
00:05:13.917 --> 00:05:14.917
Hello?

23
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.057
Rin? Rin!

24
00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.250
What happened to you?

25
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:00.875
Are you all right?

26
00:06:02.292 --> 00:06:03.583
I'll take you home, okay?

27
00:06:07.625 --> 00:06:08.625
Rin!

28
00:06:10.125 --> 00:06:11.000
Airin!

29
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.418
A sad news came from our colleague,
a freelance announcer, Alex Kusuma.

30
00:06:37.458 --> 00:06:39.542
He passed away at the age of 26.

31
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.958
Alex's body found by her mother
at his home.

32
00:06:43.458 --> 00:06:46.083
The cause of death is uncertain.

33
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.585
For those who knew Alex,
please come to his funeral...

34
00:06:49.625 --> 00:06:51.502
tomorrow at 07:00 AM.

35
00:06:51.542 --> 00:06:52.917
We all...

36
00:06:54.125 --> 00:06:56.292
lost Alex Kusuma.

37
00:06:58.333 --> 00:07:03.917
A very energetic and inspiring figure.

38
00:07:05.667 --> 00:07:07.585
Did you hear the rumor?

39
00:07:07.625 --> 00:07:10.043
We lost a friend...

40
00:07:10.083 --> 00:07:12.667
-Alex's death is not natural!
-and a role model.

41
00:07:15.125 --> 00:07:18.500
-We all...
-He hung himself at his apartment.

42
00:07:20.292 --> 00:07:22.792
going to miss Alex...

43
00:07:24.201 --> 00:07:26.701
who's always with us...

44
00:07:28.292 --> 00:07:31.708
in bad times and good times.

45
00:08:31.583 --> 00:08:32.875
Excuse me, Ma'am.

46
00:08:35.233 --> 00:08:36.683
Are you Alex's family?

47
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:40.750
Or...

48
00:08:41.533 --> 00:08:42.908
Alex's mother?

49
00:08:53.333 --> 00:08:54.708
Alex,...

50
00:08:55.473 --> 00:08:56.890
don't go!

51
00:08:57.633 --> 00:09:01.508
Ouch. Wait for me!

52
00:09:08.993 --> 00:09:11.118
My condolences, Ma'am.

53
00:09:19.417 --> 00:09:20.542
Bye, Lex...

54
00:09:50.693 --> 00:09:51.818
Are you Sara?

55
00:09:56.013 --> 00:09:58.033
It's Americano, right?

56
00:10:03.203 --> 00:10:06.370
Be careful, it's hot!

57
00:10:06.853 --> 00:10:07.895
Thanks.

58
00:10:11.003 --> 00:10:15.378
Are you sure you saw a real ghost,
and not just your hallucination?

59
00:10:17.133 --> 00:10:19.592
You already asked me ten times
about that,...

60
00:10:20.417 --> 00:10:21.875
and my answer is still the same.

61
00:10:22.458 --> 00:10:23.792
Do you think I'm crazy...

62
00:10:24.333 --> 00:10:26.917
by making a scene early in the morning
at Alex's funeral?

63
00:10:28.103 --> 00:10:31.543
I didn't say you're crazy.
We don't even know each other.

64
00:10:31.583 --> 00:10:34.083
But we lost the same person,...

65
00:10:34.123 --> 00:10:36.043
I sympathize with you

66
00:10:36.083 --> 00:10:37.333
that's why I took you here.

67
00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:42.143
Also this drunkard! There's no way
I let you alone in the grave.

68
00:10:42.183 --> 00:10:43.483
After she fell down!

69
00:10:44.383 --> 00:10:46.877
Rachel. My name is Rachel!

70
00:10:46.917 --> 00:10:48.000
All right...

71
00:10:49.625 --> 00:10:51.583
It's better if we know each other.

72
00:10:53.417 --> 00:10:54.417
I'm Sara.

73
00:10:55.593 --> 00:10:56.718
I'm Amara.

74
00:11:01.375 --> 00:11:02.417
I'm Airin.

75
00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:04.875
Where did you all know Alex?

76
00:11:06.708 --> 00:11:07.833
-Alex is my ex!
-Alex is my ex!

77
00:11:15.463 --> 00:11:16.973
Alex is also my ex.

78
00:11:20.423 --> 00:11:24.543
What? He is my ex too!

79
00:11:26.583 --> 00:11:29.375
Welcome to the ex club!

80
00:11:30.167 --> 00:11:31.500
Cheers!

81
00:11:42.143 --> 00:11:44.223
Sara surprised, too, Mom.

82
00:11:46.583 --> 00:11:49.583
Sara wasn't dating Alex for a long time.

83
00:11:52.443 --> 00:11:54.693
That's just because
our world was different.

84
00:11:55.792 --> 00:11:56.667
Open your mouth.

85
00:12:02.173 --> 00:12:04.783
But still,
Sara wasn't expecting that, Mom.

86
00:12:07.125 --> 00:12:09.750
Behind Alex's sweetness,...

87
00:12:15.053 --> 00:12:17.387
Alex played us all.

88
00:13:16.843 --> 00:13:17.973
Dear, Sarah...

89
00:13:18.393 --> 00:13:19.933
I know you must be still hurt...

90
00:13:19.973 --> 00:13:21.973
because I broke our relationship
without telling you anything.

91
00:13:22.523 --> 00:13:24.763
For three months we're dating,...

92
00:13:24.803 --> 00:13:27.013
you've always be my lovely
and faithful girlfriend.

93
00:13:29.458 --> 00:13:30.542
But to be honest,...

94
00:13:31.683 --> 00:13:33.219
for me beauty wasn't enough.

95
00:13:33.625 --> 00:13:35.793
But I'm not sending this letter
to reminisce a relationship...

96
00:13:35.833 --> 00:13:37.457
or a problem between us.

97
00:13:38.353 --> 00:13:40.813
I know something terrible
will happen to me.

98
00:13:41.483 --> 00:13:43.603
I can't prove my suspicion yet,...

99
00:13:44.583 --> 00:13:47.233
but if you got this letter
after my death,...

100
00:13:47.643 --> 00:13:49.233
that means my suspicion was right

101
00:13:49.703 --> 00:13:51.233
My death must be unnatural!

102
00:13:51.793 --> 00:13:53.233
And the one who killed me...

103
00:13:53.733 --> 00:13:57.483
must be one of four my last exes
whom I dated at the same time!

104
00:13:58.917 --> 00:14:00.083
Sara.

105
00:14:00.792 --> 00:14:01.750
Amara.

106
00:14:02.375 --> 00:14:03.175
Rachel.

107
00:14:04.043 --> 00:14:05.377
And you, Airin!

108
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.668
Calm down, don't be a rude girl!

109
00:14:13.708 --> 00:14:14.668
Don't you feel it?

110
00:14:14.708 --> 00:14:17.043
There's something strange
from our letters.

111
00:14:17.083 --> 00:14:19.292
It must be a prank. There's someone
who want to prank us!

112
00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:21.193
Well, who?

113
00:14:21.233 --> 00:14:22.752
We just don't know if it turns out...

114
00:14:22.792 --> 00:14:26.043
that Alex been dating us
for three months.

115
00:14:26.083 --> 00:14:29.503
Until he broke up with us too,
all at the same time!

116
00:14:29.543 --> 00:14:33.193
So, maybe this is
just his new adventures.

117
00:14:33.233 --> 00:14:34.983
So, who knows about us?

118
00:14:36.643 --> 00:14:38.653
The letter that Alex writes you
was right.

119
00:14:38.693 --> 00:14:40.877
Being pretty is not enough,
your brain is empty!

120
00:14:40.917 --> 00:14:43.043
How dare you, bitch!
Who told you I have an empty brain, huh?

121
00:14:43.083 --> 00:14:44.710
Enough!

122
00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:46.733
We are here to discuss the letters.

123
00:14:47.708 --> 00:14:49.668
Rachel had the point.

124
00:14:49.708 --> 00:14:53.042
Even thefour of us didn't know
that we all are Alex's exes.

125
00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.042
Does anyone else know this?

126
00:14:57.343 --> 00:14:59.468
Could be. Why not?

127
00:15:00.453 --> 00:15:02.335
A jerk like Alex,...

128
00:15:02.375 --> 00:15:04.917
he will definitely make us bet
with his friends.

129
00:15:06.123 --> 00:15:10.123
It could be that everyone in his circle
knew that we were played by him,...

130
00:15:10.543 --> 00:15:11.903
and they all are laughing at us.

131
00:15:12.625 --> 00:15:15.252
And one of them continue
this silly game...

132
00:15:15.292 --> 00:15:17.625
by exploiting Alex's unnatural death.

133
00:15:18.167 --> 00:15:19.668
Unnatural how?

134
00:15:19.708 --> 00:15:22.043
If someone really kill him,
it should be me!

135
00:15:22.083 --> 00:15:24.917
It's not like that, Rachel.

136
00:15:25.625 --> 00:15:27.667
You were still drunk yesterday.

137
00:15:28.073 --> 00:15:31.583
We're talking about the rumor
that spreads in Alex's friends.

138
00:15:32.283 --> 00:15:35.033
-Alex hung himself.
-What?

139
00:15:37.323 --> 00:15:38.627
But, it's not funny!

140
00:15:38.667 --> 00:15:42.293
Whoever came up with this joke or prank,
for whatever purpose,...

141
00:15:42.333 --> 00:15:46.013
however jerk Alex was, his death
doesn't deserve to be a joke like this!

142
00:15:46.875 --> 00:15:49.708
Yeah, but that's
just your assumption, Rin.

143
00:15:51.417 --> 00:15:56.000
But, what if these letters
were written by Alex?

144
00:15:56.875 --> 00:15:58.210
And that means...

145
00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:00.877
Alex was murdered
by someone who makes his murder...

146
00:16:00.917 --> 00:16:02.333
looks like a suicide.

147
00:16:04.292 --> 00:16:09.708
So, it means his murderer
is one of us, right?

148
00:16:19.483 --> 00:16:21.333
A pleasure in music...

149
00:16:21.373 --> 00:16:26.085
is when we can collaborate
in combining harmony,...

150
00:16:26.125 --> 00:16:28.750
being able to create beautiful melody.

151
00:16:29.413 --> 00:16:30.372
Keyboard...

152
00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:37.433
Guitar? Ready?

153
00:16:43.792 --> 00:16:44.833
All!

154
00:16:58.603 --> 00:17:03.583
Stop! Please concentrate. Focus!

155
00:17:04.333 --> 00:17:08.333
Or I'll replace you
with other student. Understand?

156
00:17:08.875 --> 00:17:09.833
Yes, Miss.

157
00:17:10.873 --> 00:17:12.023
Keyboard!

158
00:17:17.593 --> 00:17:19.443
Now, guitar.

159
00:17:26.143 --> 00:17:27.227
Go!

160
00:17:37.163 --> 00:17:40.455
Sara, wait! Sar!

161
00:17:42.943 --> 00:17:44.693
-Sar.
-Yeah?

162
00:17:45.543 --> 00:17:47.752
I just want to ask, are you all right?

163
00:17:48.573 --> 00:17:52.418
-Why?
-Because I saw that you didn't focus.

164
00:17:52.458 --> 00:17:55.500
You look exhausted. Something wrong?

165
00:17:59.093 --> 00:18:01.103
It's about my ex, Alex.

166
00:18:01.703 --> 00:18:05.673
-He died three days ago.
-Alex?

167
00:18:14.125 --> 00:18:17.085
Sar, in my opinion...

168
00:18:17.125 --> 00:18:21.913
First, you have to check this writing
with Alex's handwriting.

169
00:18:22.813 --> 00:18:25.763
But, even if the writing
is identical,...

170
00:18:26.173 --> 00:18:28.943
that doesn't make
this letter's true, Sar.

171
00:18:28.983 --> 00:18:32.453
I'm hoping that this letter's not true.

172
00:18:32.933 --> 00:18:36.303
-Because if it's true...
-So what if it's true?

173
00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:42.585
Sar, you said it yourself
that Alex was a jerk!

174
00:18:42.625 --> 00:18:44.627
So, if there's someone
who killed him,...

175
00:18:44.667 --> 00:18:48.043
that doesn't mean
the killer will kill Alex's exes right?

176
00:18:48.083 --> 00:18:50.750
Yes, you're right!

177
00:18:51.542 --> 00:18:54.493
But, it still doesn't feel right.

178
00:18:54.533 --> 00:19:00.616
If one of Amara, Airin or Rachel
really killed Alex!

179
00:19:05.333 --> 00:19:09.083
I don't deserve to be suspected,
I'm not a killer!

180
00:19:11.208 --> 00:19:14.168
Sara, you're not a killer.

181
00:19:14.208 --> 00:19:16.000
You're too beautiful and...

182
00:19:22.708 --> 00:19:23.958
Come, I'll take you home!

183
00:19:41.625 --> 00:19:44.167
-Bye...
-Yes.

184
00:20:09.033 --> 00:20:10.241
Mommy!

185
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.083
Mommy!

186
00:20:46.083 --> 00:20:47.083
Mommy!

187
00:22:22.393 --> 00:22:23.627
Airin!

188
00:22:23.667 --> 00:22:24.833
Wait for me!

189
00:22:25.753 --> 00:22:26.795
Rin!

190
00:22:27.792 --> 00:22:29.917
Nio, please. I'm not in the mood.

191
00:22:30.333 --> 00:22:31.833
Why not in the mood?

192
00:22:32.533 --> 00:22:34.752
-Where's your car?
-It's none of your business!

193
00:22:34.792 --> 00:22:37.043
That's why you only trained
for half an hour?

194
00:22:37.083 --> 00:22:39.208
Because you're not in the mood?
Or are you sick?

195
00:22:39.667 --> 00:22:42.683
You know, you're the most noisy boy
that I ever know!

196
00:22:42.723 --> 00:22:45.002
I told you its not your business!

197
00:22:45.042 --> 00:22:46.250
I'll make this my business, Rin,...

198
00:22:46.875 --> 00:22:48.210
because I like you!

199
00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:50.377
Could you, just for once,
don't be corny!

200
00:22:50.417 --> 00:22:52.958
I see, you're in your period!

201
00:22:53.417 --> 00:22:55.583
-It's not your business!
-It is!

202
00:22:56.263 --> 00:22:58.573
Okay, just calm down.

203
00:22:59.125 --> 00:23:01.583
We're going to sit there,
and I'll order your favorite foods!

204
00:23:16.483 --> 00:23:19.719
Thank's. Why you're so kind to me?

205
00:23:20.417 --> 00:23:23.043
Even though I'm bad with you.

206
00:23:23.083 --> 00:23:24.750
Do you really like me?

207
00:23:27.958 --> 00:23:30.875
You just answering
your own question. Girls!

208
00:23:32.792 --> 00:23:34.500
You really paying for this?

209
00:23:35.625 --> 00:23:40.458
Yes, just order
as much as you like, I'll pay for it!

210
00:23:48.208 --> 00:23:49.333
Hei, baby!

211
00:23:55.917 --> 00:23:57.042
What are you eating?

212
00:23:58.263 --> 00:24:00.055
Huh? Give it to me!

213
00:24:00.917 --> 00:24:01.958
Let me see it!

214
00:24:07.167 --> 00:24:08.958
Give it to me! What is this?

215
00:24:09.483 --> 00:24:10.723
Mayonnaise, cheese.

216
00:24:13.173 --> 00:24:15.343
I told you many times, no cheese!

217
00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:18.723
This photo deal
is worth hundreds of millions,...

218
00:24:18.763 --> 00:24:21.563
and it wont happen
if you can't wear this dress!

219
00:24:25.253 --> 00:24:28.983
Quickly, spit it out! Here. Hurry!

220
00:24:29.653 --> 00:24:30.653
Spit it out!

221
00:24:44.292 --> 00:24:45.667
See, there's a lot of it!

222
00:24:49.003 --> 00:24:50.170
All of it?

223
00:24:52.463 --> 00:24:53.833
Okay, go there, be ready!

224
00:24:57.208 --> 00:25:00.333
Okay, Miss. One, two. Again.

225
00:25:00.917 --> 00:25:02.375
One, two.

226
00:25:03.458 --> 00:25:05.417
Okay, focus on the camera, Miss.
One, two...

227
00:25:05.958 --> 00:25:07.750
Again, one, two...

228
00:25:09.053 --> 00:25:11.533
More, a little chin up, Miss.
One, two...

229
00:25:13.167 --> 00:25:15.292
Over here, Miss. One, two...

230
00:25:16.458 --> 00:25:18.458
-Again, Miss...
-Hey, Rachel! Come on!

231
00:25:23.875 --> 00:25:25.458
One, two...

232
00:25:29.333 --> 00:25:32.083
Rach, come on! It's already late.
Hurry up!

233
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.292
Ready? Over here. One, two...

234
00:25:35.792 --> 00:25:37.793
Over here, Miss.
Right there. One, two...

235
00:25:37.833 --> 00:25:40.958
Miss, I'll have another three
of this, please. Take away!

236
00:25:53.933 --> 00:25:55.933
Rin? Rin!

237
00:25:56.375 --> 00:25:57.417
What's wrong?

238
00:26:02.773 --> 00:26:04.127
What would you like to order?

239
00:26:04.167 --> 00:26:06.210
What is your best seller here?

240
00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:09.292
Our best seller is this one, Miss.

241
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.583
-Yes.
-I'll have that, please.

242
00:26:20.167 --> 00:26:23.003
-Miss, where's my ice cappuccino?
-Yes?

243
00:26:23.753 --> 00:26:25.545
Oh, right, Miss. In a minute.

244
00:26:46.042 --> 00:26:47.627
Ice cappuccino.

245
00:26:47.667 --> 00:26:49.458
It's already here.

246
00:26:50.042 --> 00:26:52.000
Oh, sorry...

247
00:26:56.958 --> 00:26:57.875
Amara?

248
00:26:59.208 --> 00:27:00.460
Amara!

249
00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:02.000
-What's wrong with you?
-Huh?

250
00:27:02.833 --> 00:27:04.167
Nothing. I'm fine.

251
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:08.417
Devon!

252
00:27:09.033 --> 00:27:10.325
Can I excuse myself?

253
00:27:11.167 --> 00:27:13.143
I'm not feeling well.

254
00:27:13.183 --> 00:27:14.558
Are you sick?

255
00:27:15.792 --> 00:27:18.483
So, are you canceling tonight?

256
00:27:18.523 --> 00:27:21.543
No! I'll text you when to pick me up.

257
00:27:21.583 --> 00:27:24.625
-Really? I'll wait then!
-Yes.

258
00:27:58.633 --> 00:28:01.466
Amara!

259
00:28:03.042 --> 00:28:05.042
Amara.

260
00:28:05.917 --> 00:28:07.125
Amara.

261
00:28:21.583 --> 00:28:25.710
Amara, please open the door!

262
00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:27.917
Your mother is working late!

263
00:28:28.458 --> 00:28:31.167
Honey, open the door!

264
00:28:36.458 --> 00:28:37.958
Amara...

265
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000
Honey, open the door.

266
00:28:43.833 --> 00:28:45.333
Amara.

267
00:28:47.125 --> 00:28:48.542
Amara.

268
00:29:04.875 --> 00:29:07.583
Sar! Hey, Sar. Wait!

269
00:29:10.292 --> 00:29:14.463
Sar, what if
after your mother sleep tonight,...

270
00:29:15.463 --> 00:29:16.763
I'll come to your house?

271
00:29:18.673 --> 00:29:21.343
Sorry, I can't.

272
00:29:22.063 --> 00:29:24.523
My mother has been sick for three years.

273
00:29:25.708 --> 00:29:27.873
So, I have to take care of her.

274
00:29:27.913 --> 00:29:28.793
Oh...

275
00:29:29.792 --> 00:29:31.323
Sorry, I didn't know that.

276
00:29:31.363 --> 00:29:32.923
-Yeah.
-Sara...

277
00:29:36.625 --> 00:29:40.667
-Sorry, Ray. My friend is here.
-Okay.

278
00:29:44.683 --> 00:29:48.350
Ra, what are you doing here?

279
00:29:50.208 --> 00:29:52.375
I don't know where else to go, Sar.

280
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.792
Can I stay at your house tonight?

281
00:29:58.223 --> 00:30:01.883
-I'll explain it later.
-Why?

282
00:30:02.923 --> 00:30:05.633
I can't stay at home
with my stepfather.

283
00:30:10.603 --> 00:30:11.853
He...

284
00:30:13.883 --> 00:30:18.123
Yes. Okay, let's go
to my house! Come on!

285
00:30:23.958 --> 00:30:25.583
Ra, you said...

286
00:30:26.913 --> 00:30:30.233
it's been three years
since this harassment happened.

287
00:30:30.763 --> 00:30:32.793
Why you let him do it, Ra?

288
00:30:34.413 --> 00:30:39.573
Why didn't you tell your mother
or the police?

289
00:30:52.667 --> 00:30:55.125
There's one thing you should know, Sar.

290
00:30:56.792 --> 00:31:00.167
I was born without father.

291
00:31:03.167 --> 00:31:06.250
My mother was a rape victim, Sar.

292
00:31:07.083 --> 00:31:09.263
And worse,...

293
00:31:14.993 --> 00:31:17.513
my mother was gang raped,...

294
00:31:19.003 --> 00:31:24.233
and didn't know which of those bastards
is my biological father.

295
00:31:27.625 --> 00:31:28.513
Once...

296
00:31:29.313 --> 00:31:32.763
I tried reporting my stepfather...

297
00:31:32.803 --> 00:31:35.333
when he touches me for the first time.

298
00:31:38.693 --> 00:31:41.553
But, my mom locked me up
for almost a week.

299
00:31:41.593 --> 00:31:43.043
Without food!

300
00:31:46.743 --> 00:31:47.753
After that,...

301
00:31:49.103 --> 00:31:51.373
my mom tried to kill herself,...

302
00:31:52.593 --> 00:31:55.173
but my stepfather interfered.

303
00:32:04.103 --> 00:32:06.773
And since that,...

304
00:32:08.083 --> 00:32:11.293
I have never reported
my stepfather again,...

305
00:32:11.333 --> 00:32:12.958
even though he still touches me.

306
00:32:14.813 --> 00:32:19.042
That's why I installed a lot of locks
in my room to prevent that!

307
00:32:37.363 --> 00:32:39.403
Don't go back to that house, Ra.

308
00:32:41.167 --> 00:32:42.917
You can stay here...

309
00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:46.667
until you find a new place to stay.
Okay?

310
00:32:51.543 --> 00:32:56.043
Sorry, I have to prepare
my mother's meal.

311
00:32:56.083 --> 00:32:57.417
I'm going to leave you here.

312
00:32:58.203 --> 00:33:03.153
By the way, is it okay if my friend
pick me up tonight?

313
00:33:03.193 --> 00:33:05.143
What is the address of this house?

314
00:33:05.183 --> 00:33:07.627
Kolonel Masturi Street, number 100.

315
00:33:07.667 --> 00:33:09.792
Masturi... Okay, thank you.

316
00:33:21.333 --> 00:33:22.626
(Dev, pick me up
at Kolonel Masturi Street, number 100.)

317
00:33:22.666 --> 00:33:24.623
(Next to Kampung Legok Hotel
at 20:00 tonight.)

318
00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:53.708
Sara...

319
00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:06.542
Sara...

320
00:34:43.625 --> 00:34:44.667
Sar...

321
00:34:51.563 --> 00:34:52.605
Sara...

322
00:36:16.053 --> 00:36:18.720
I found these stuffs at Sara's attic!

323
00:36:19.323 --> 00:36:21.627
All of you been dating with Alex
for three months, right?

324
00:36:21.667 --> 00:36:23.708
You should know
Alex's personal belongings?

325
00:36:27.613 --> 00:36:30.083
This deodorant! This is Alex's, right?

326
00:36:30.792 --> 00:36:32.708
-Right?
-So?

327
00:36:34.375 --> 00:36:36.958
You can still calmly say, "So"?

328
00:36:43.958 --> 00:36:45.417
Excuse me, Amara!

329
00:36:51.783 --> 00:36:52.825
Amara?

330
00:36:59.375 --> 00:37:00.417
Amara?

331
00:37:02.253 --> 00:37:03.295
Hello?

332
00:37:04.213 --> 00:37:05.958
Amara, this is me, Devon!

333
00:37:13.542 --> 00:37:14.625
Amara?

334
00:37:19.583 --> 00:37:22.873
Guys, do you remember
the letters Alex sent us?

335
00:37:23.523 --> 00:37:24.923
He said he was murdered,...

336
00:37:25.373 --> 00:37:27.923
and the killer
is among his last exes,...

337
00:37:27.963 --> 00:37:29.243
which is four of us!

338
00:37:30.542 --> 00:37:34.073
And this is one sign
that Sara is a psychopath!

339
00:37:34.113 --> 00:37:37.853
A whole box with Alex's stuffs!

340
00:37:38.523 --> 00:37:39.533
Yeah, so?

341
00:37:41.243 --> 00:37:47.085
Look, Rachel who is beautiful,
but brainless meant is...

342
00:37:47.125 --> 00:37:48.917
this time I agree with Rachel.

343
00:37:49.513 --> 00:37:51.793
Perhaps because they're together
for three months,...

344
00:37:51.833 --> 00:37:55.883
and after they broke up,
she kept these stuff.

345
00:37:55.923 --> 00:37:58.043
But that doesn't prove
that Sara is the killer!

346
00:37:58.083 --> 00:37:59.763
No way!

347
00:38:00.163 --> 00:38:02.043
I know very well the condition
of Sara's house,...

348
00:38:02.083 --> 00:38:03.733
there's her mother who is ill,...

349
00:38:03.773 --> 00:38:05.803
and Alex can't live there!

350
00:38:06.208 --> 00:38:07.835
-Because of her sick mother?
-Yes.

351
00:38:07.875 --> 00:38:08.835
-Stroke?
-Yes.

352
00:38:08.875 --> 00:38:11.708
Amara, this time you're slower
than Rachel!

353
00:38:12.423 --> 00:38:14.703
Because her mother was seriously ill,...

354
00:38:14.743 --> 00:38:17.013
she couldn't forbid Sara
to live together with Alex!

355
00:38:17.417 --> 00:38:21.418
And Sara is different than us,
probably it's easier for us to move on.

356
00:38:21.458 --> 00:38:25.335
But, for a girl like her,
introvert, shy...

357
00:38:25.375 --> 00:38:27.083
She couldn't get a boyfriend
fast enough.

358
00:38:27.667 --> 00:38:31.323
After all, if you're so sure
that Sara kills Alex,...

359
00:38:31.923 --> 00:38:35.063
how would she kill Alex? And where?

360
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000
Amara?

361
00:38:48.333 --> 00:38:49.627
Amara!

362
00:38:49.667 --> 00:38:50.958
It's me, Devon!

363
00:39:41.667 --> 00:39:44.667
Okay, if you all don't believe me,...

364
00:39:45.875 --> 00:39:47.458
I will look into it myself.

365
00:39:50.667 --> 00:39:53.625
Then, what? Trying to prove
that Sara is the killer?

366
00:39:54.042 --> 00:39:58.418
Ra, it's not our fault
that a lot of people hate Alex,...

367
00:39:58.458 --> 00:40:00.168
and try to kill him!

368
00:40:00.208 --> 00:40:04.793
Also it's not our fault if Alex
wasn't murdered, but commited suicide!

369
00:40:04.833 --> 00:40:08.917
And someone's using his death
to play with us.

370
00:40:09.792 --> 00:40:12.875
Ra, Alex is death! Let it go!

371
00:40:14.563 --> 00:40:15.563
Hey babe.

372
00:40:19.042 --> 00:40:20.167
Who's dead?

373
00:40:22.293 --> 00:40:24.389
Sorry, girls. I have to go!

374
00:40:25.083 --> 00:40:26.625
Eh, where are you going?

375
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:30.503
Don't you want to introduce
your boyfriend to your friends?

376
00:40:30.543 --> 00:40:32.293
They are not my friends.

377
00:40:32.333 --> 00:40:34.668
Come on, let's go! Bye.

378
00:40:34.708 --> 00:40:35.792
Come on, babe.

379
00:40:36.833 --> 00:40:37.833
Bitch!

380
00:40:39.292 --> 00:40:40.543
Hey!

381
00:40:40.583 --> 00:40:41.792
What happened?

382
00:40:42.292 --> 00:40:44.500
Why didn't you introduce me
to your friends?

383
00:40:45.042 --> 00:40:47.167
They're nobodies.

384
00:40:48.917 --> 00:40:50.542
Then, who's dead?

385
00:40:52.208 --> 00:40:54.710
-That's nothing, Marco.
-That's nothing?

386
00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:57.792
All right. Wait!

387
00:40:58.375 --> 00:41:00.000
Hey, I'm talking to you!

388
00:41:08.292 --> 00:41:10.418
Do you still upset
because of this afternoon?

389
00:41:10.458 --> 00:41:11.375
Huh?

390
00:41:12.873 --> 00:41:13.748
Answer me!

391
00:41:16.667 --> 00:41:18.583
Why don't we start moving?

392
00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:21.917
You do know that I'm in love with you?

393
00:41:22.708 --> 00:41:24.835
But, that doesn't mean
our work is less important.

394
00:41:24.875 --> 00:41:26.918
That photo deal
is worth hundreds of millions,...

395
00:41:26.958 --> 00:41:29.458
and that will also determine
my love for you!

396
00:41:30.803 --> 00:41:32.733
Hey, if you don't want to,...

397
00:41:35.375 --> 00:41:37.625
I'll replace you with another girl!

398
00:41:39.375 --> 00:41:40.792
Now, you're crying.

399
00:41:43.292 --> 00:41:45.792
So, listen to me!

400
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.333
Everybody said I'm stupid!

401
00:41:53.833 --> 00:41:57.918
But I'm not stupid enough
to know that you're a bastard!

402
00:41:57.958 --> 00:42:00.335
You're no different from my ex!

403
00:42:00.375 --> 00:42:01.209
Your ex?

404
00:42:01.249 --> 00:42:04.543
The dead guy we were talking about
is my ex!

405
00:42:04.583 --> 00:42:06.793
And if you don't want to go to hell
with me,...

406
00:42:06.833 --> 00:42:09.033
you better leave me now!

407
00:42:09.073 --> 00:42:14.273
Is that so? Rach!

408
00:42:42.417 --> 00:42:44.000
So, this is her house!

409
00:42:46.133 --> 00:42:48.800
Ra, are you sure this is a good idea?

410
00:42:49.542 --> 00:42:52.750
I mean this all
is just your silly assumption!

411
00:42:53.292 --> 00:42:55.085
Sara can be offended.

412
00:42:55.125 --> 00:42:59.418
Not just that, Rin.
I just remembered along the way...

413
00:42:59.458 --> 00:43:01.917
that I asked Devon,
my friend, to pick me up here.

414
00:43:03.875 --> 00:43:05.708
And that was about an hour ago.

415
00:43:06.292 --> 00:43:10.125
Devon must have arrived in this house,
that's why I'd like to make sure!

416
00:43:12.893 --> 00:43:14.953
Okay, come on.

417
00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:29.667
It's not locked?

418
00:43:33.513 --> 00:43:34.638
Sara?

419
00:43:38.625 --> 00:43:39.625
Devon?

420
00:43:44.033 --> 00:43:46.423
-Devon?
-Ra?

421
00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:50.710
-Ra...
-You need to comb your hair.

422
00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:54.418
You said her mother is ill,
then who's voice is that?

423
00:43:54.458 --> 00:43:56.002
Let me comb your hair first.

424
00:43:56.042 --> 00:43:58.583
I think Sara doesn't sound like that.

425
00:43:59.042 --> 00:44:02.333
Come here, honey.
You can play again after this.

426
00:44:02.792 --> 00:44:05.417
If you don't comb your hair...

427
00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:09.103
-Come here.
-Let's go upstairs!

428
00:44:09.143 --> 00:44:12.923
Huh? Ra, just wait here!

429
00:44:13.417 --> 00:44:16.417
Ra, wait!

430
00:44:37.375 --> 00:44:38.583
I'll go check downstairs.

431
00:46:34.333 --> 00:46:35.500
Excuse me.

432
00:46:38.083 --> 00:46:39.208
Is there anything more?

433
00:46:39.833 --> 00:46:41.167
Okay, thank you.

434
00:46:41.583 --> 00:46:43.958
-Mas, where's Amara?
-Yes?

435
00:46:44.958 --> 00:46:47.752
-Amara?
-Amara, my friend.

436
00:46:47.792 --> 00:46:49.793
She's a waitress here.

437
00:46:49.833 --> 00:46:52.208
There's no waitress named Amara
who works in this cafe.

438
00:46:52.875 --> 00:46:57.585
There's only three waiters here.
Me, Dian and Rizki.

439
00:46:57.625 --> 00:46:59.877
Only two baristas. Devon dan Agra.

440
00:46:59.917 --> 00:47:01.500
There's no one named Amara here.

441
00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:05.708
Really? She's this tall.

442
00:47:06.375 --> 00:47:08.085
A long hair.

443
00:47:08.125 --> 00:47:10.583
And she always wear black jeans.

444
00:47:11.163 --> 00:47:14.713
Miss, you're not a new customer here.

445
00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:19.208
There's no other waiters and baristas,
except those I've mention earlier.

446
00:47:21.833 --> 00:47:23.375
Thank you.

447
00:47:27.917 --> 00:47:31.000
He said I'm not a new customer here?

448
00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:34.833
I clearly just came here yesterday.

449
00:47:35.625 --> 00:47:38.042
And thats because of Amara.

450
00:47:45.208 --> 00:47:46.292
Rachel!

451
00:47:47.917 --> 00:47:49.168
What are you doing here?

452
00:47:49.208 --> 00:47:50.835
How did you know that I'm here?

453
00:47:50.875 --> 00:47:53.543
Rachel you should come with me.
There's something you have to see!

454
00:47:53.583 --> 00:47:56.377
No, Amara said you're a psychopath!

455
00:47:56.417 --> 00:47:59.042
-Go away!
-Rachel.

456
00:48:08.875 --> 00:48:10.125
Marco?

457
00:48:11.833 --> 00:48:13.667
Marco, open the door!

458
00:48:14.208 --> 00:48:16.703
Marco, open the door!

459
00:48:16.743 --> 00:48:17.701
Marco!

460
00:49:26.667 --> 00:49:28.792
(Sara, Amara, Rachel, Airin.
They all have to die.)

461
00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:40.085
Nio, you're home.

462
00:49:40.125 --> 00:49:41.667
Mom, Nio would like to talk to you.

463
00:49:47.375 --> 00:49:50.792
Mom, you're a psychiatrist.
What do you think about this?

464
00:50:41.167 --> 00:50:45.500
Shut up!

465
00:51:20.583 --> 00:51:22.083
You bastard!

466
00:51:47.792 --> 00:51:49.583
What do you think, Mom?

467
00:51:52.958 --> 00:51:55.292
It looks like we should report this
to the police immediately.

468
00:51:56.417 --> 00:52:00.125
Do you know where
your friend's house is?

469
00:52:00.875 --> 00:52:02.167
What is his name?

470
00:52:02.667 --> 00:52:03.625
Alex.

471
00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:22.292
Good evening, sir. I'm Marina.

472
00:52:23.583 --> 00:52:29.625
I would like to report
an alleged murder.

473
00:52:35.833 --> 00:52:38.167
The suspect is allegedly named Alex.

474
00:52:40.250 --> 00:52:44.208
I suspect he has a mental illness.

475
00:52:48.458 --> 00:52:49.667
Okay, sir.

476
00:53:37.625 --> 00:53:39.750
He has multiple personality disorder,...

477
00:53:40.375 --> 00:53:42.500
and he will not realize it...

478
00:53:42.958 --> 00:53:45.833
when his personality shifts.

479
00:53:47.333 --> 00:53:51.833
-Come on. Let's dance, honey.
-I have to work!

480
00:53:52.250 --> 00:53:55.167
If it's not becuse of you
who always get drunk,...

481
00:53:55.792 --> 00:53:59.085
I don't have to work
at three restaurants until morning!

482
00:53:59.125 --> 00:54:02.363
Listen, if not because
of your stupid child,....

483
00:54:02.403 --> 00:54:04.335
and if you would listen to me...

484
00:54:04.375 --> 00:54:05.793
to leave him
with your mother in the village,...

485
00:54:05.833 --> 00:54:07.835
everything will be all right!

486
00:54:07.875 --> 00:54:10.001
Afterall, it's been a while
since the last time we're dancing.

487
00:54:10.041 --> 00:54:11.583
Enough.

488
00:54:16.167 --> 00:54:18.583
Hey! Stupid woman!

489
00:54:31.583 --> 00:54:32.875
Alex...

490
00:54:34.792 --> 00:54:37.042
Let's play, Alex. Come on!

491
00:54:39.875 --> 00:54:41.333
Alex...

492
00:54:59.833 --> 00:55:02.423
Alex, why are you still sleeping?

493
00:55:02.463 --> 00:55:06.213
Mommy...

494
00:55:06.625 --> 00:55:08.917
-Alex is sick, Mom.
-What is it?

495
00:55:09.458 --> 00:55:13.208
-You have no fever. What is it?
-Mommy...

496
00:55:13.667 --> 00:55:16.208
Alex is sick, Mommy...

497
00:55:21.793 --> 00:55:25.085
Beast! Bastard!

498
00:55:41.958 --> 00:55:45.418
The harassment committed
by Alex's stepfather...

499
00:55:45.458 --> 00:55:47.833
when he was 10 years old,...

500
00:55:48.542 --> 00:55:52.625
and torture carried out
by his own biological mother,...

501
00:55:53.292 --> 00:55:58.125
made Alex grow
into mentally ill young man.

502
00:57:09.417 --> 00:57:10.708
I'm sorry, Mom.

503
00:57:13.333 --> 00:57:14.875
Bastard!

504
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.733
Bastard! What are you going to be?

505
00:57:18.773 --> 00:57:21.106
Pervert! Jerk!

506
00:57:21.917 --> 00:57:22.943
I'm sorry, Mom.

507
00:57:22.983 --> 00:57:26.900
-Mercy me, Mom.
-What are you going to be?

508
00:57:28.667 --> 00:57:31.168
-Mercy me, Mom.
-Bastard!

509
00:57:31.208 --> 00:57:33.417
Mercy me, Mom.

510
00:57:34.458 --> 00:57:38.002
-Mercy me, Mom.
-What are you going to do?

511
00:57:38.042 --> 00:57:40.460
-Mercy me, Mom.
-What are you going to be?

512
00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:43.835
Mercy me, Mom. I love you, Mom.

513
00:57:43.875 --> 00:57:47.375
-What are you going to be?
-Mercy me, Mom.

514
00:57:49.208 --> 00:57:53.292
-Mercy me, Mom. I'm sorry.
-What are you going to be?

515
00:58:33.042 --> 00:58:36.502
You're a bastard! Mercy me, Mom!

516
00:58:36.542 --> 00:58:41.213
Mercy me, Mom.

517
00:58:41.253 --> 00:58:44.043
Alex loves you. I'm sorry, Mom!

518
00:58:44.083 --> 00:58:48.625
Alex, don't be afraid!

519
00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:53.250
I'm here with you.

520
00:58:55.792 --> 00:58:57.083
Just calm down.

521
00:58:57.833 --> 00:59:02.375
From now on, I'll help you
taking care of your mother.

522
00:59:15.542 --> 00:59:21.458
Alex's past trauma
made his mind sick, Nio.

523
00:59:22.042 --> 00:59:25.167
Just like what he did to his own mother.

524
00:59:28.833 --> 00:59:30.250
Freeze!

525
00:59:30.958 --> 00:59:32.208
Hands in the air!

526
00:59:33.208 --> 00:59:34.583
-Turn it around!
-Yes, sir!

527
00:59:47.917 --> 00:59:55.083
He creates the personalities
inspired by his surroundings.

528
00:59:56.417 --> 00:59:58.708
There's a girl named Sara.

529
00:59:59.292 --> 01:00:03.523
Sara is a girl who is good
at playing cello.

530
01:00:03.563 --> 01:00:05.501
And her life is trapped...

531
01:00:05.541 --> 01:00:08.043
only to take care of
her paralyzed mother.

532
01:00:08.083 --> 01:00:10.543
This personality's inspired...

533
01:00:10.583 --> 01:00:13.249
by Alex's hobby to listening
to a classic music.

534
01:00:13.883 --> 01:00:17.919
Then, a girl named Amara.

535
01:00:17.958 --> 01:00:22.958
A waitress who traumatized
by her stepfather harassment.

536
01:00:23.583 --> 01:00:27.208
This figure exist because of...

537
01:00:27.667 --> 01:00:30.542
Alex's own experience.

538
01:00:31.458 --> 01:00:35.167
Also from his mother figure
who's a cafe waitress.

539
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:39.125
Then, Airin?

540
01:00:39.625 --> 01:00:42.877
Airin is a tough girl...

541
01:00:42.917 --> 01:00:45.083
with a rebelious soul.

542
01:00:45.813 --> 01:00:50.933
This personalities exist because of
Alex's obsession, Rachel.

543
01:00:52.023 --> 01:00:55.252
Rachel is a sexy model...

544
01:00:55.292 --> 01:00:57.000
that he really likes!

545
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.343
Alex secretly watched her,...

546
01:01:03.383 --> 01:01:08.043
but the personality
that in charge the most is Sara.

547
01:01:14.958 --> 01:01:16.292
Read this.

548
01:01:16.833 --> 01:01:18.433
Just the first letters.

549
01:01:19.167 --> 01:01:21.792
From top to bottom.

550
01:01:23.292 --> 01:01:24.750
What do you read?

551
01:01:25.708 --> 01:01:27.875
-Sara?
-Yes!

552
01:01:28.343 --> 01:01:34.293
Those four personalities
are ruled by one personality, Sara!

553
01:01:34.333 --> 01:01:38.917
Because Sara's the first personality
that created by Alex.

554
01:01:39.667 --> 01:01:44.167
And Sara's always come to protect Alex.

555
01:02:02.083 --> 01:02:04.417
It's Americano, right?

556
01:02:09.963 --> 01:02:13.338
-Where did you all knew Alex?
-Alex is my ex.

557
01:02:16.383 --> 01:02:20.425
What? He is my ex too!

558
01:02:22.573 --> 01:02:26.793
Welcome to the Ex Club! Cheers...

559
01:02:26.833 --> 01:02:33.875
So, all this time Alex thinks himself
sometime as Airin,...

560
01:02:35.292 --> 01:02:37.375
-at the same time can become Sara,...
-Yes.

561
01:02:37.792 --> 01:02:41.250
Amara and Rachel at the same time?

562
01:02:42.208 --> 01:02:44.710
-Mas, where is Amara?
-Yes?

563
01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:47.543
-Amara?
-Yes, Amara, my friend.

564
01:02:47.583 --> 01:02:49.376
She's also a waitress here.

565
01:02:49.416 --> 01:02:53.124
Mas, there's no Amara
in this cafe. Excuse me.

566
01:03:00.667 --> 01:03:02.043
Rachel?

567
01:03:02.083 --> 01:03:05.083
What are you doing here?
How do you know that I'm here?

568
01:03:05.542 --> 01:03:07.252
You must come with me,
there's something that I...

569
01:03:07.292 --> 01:03:10.458
No, Amara said
that you're a psychopath!

570
01:03:11.667 --> 01:03:13.708
Go away!

571
01:03:16.792 --> 01:03:19.375
And in Alex's delusion,...

572
01:03:20.053 --> 01:03:22.667
they are another personality pair.

573
01:03:24.083 --> 01:03:25.167
Yes.

574
01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:29.583
And his mind creates their own roles
according to their version.

575
01:03:30.125 --> 01:03:33.153
Like Marco, Rayhan and Devon.

576
01:03:33.193 --> 01:03:37.276
In the real world, they are gym buddies
who like to bully him.

577
01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:42.168
Why are you looking at me when I was
in the shower yesterday?

578
01:03:42.208 --> 01:03:44.973
You have lust for me? Is it?

579
01:03:46.167 --> 01:03:49.000
You pretend to train here
because of us, right?

580
01:03:50.250 --> 01:03:53.667
So, you're a faggot
with a hidden agenda?

581
01:03:57.750 --> 01:03:59.085
Eat that!

582
01:03:59.125 --> 01:04:02.000
Eat that, faggot!

583
01:04:20.963 --> 01:04:22.919
They'e always jerks since the beginning.

584
01:04:23.708 --> 01:04:25.083
Why you didn't stood up?

585
01:04:28.792 --> 01:04:29.958
I'm Nio.

586
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:34.917
Alex.

587
01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:42.000
Next time, if they bother you again,
just fight them. Don't be afraid!

588
01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:24.333
Go on! Why stop?

589
01:05:25.708 --> 01:05:28.583
-Come on.
-Go on, don't be shy!

590
01:05:48.625 --> 01:05:51.958
Faggot! Don't be a jerk!

591
01:06:03.667 --> 01:06:04.875
Are you all right?

592
01:06:15.875 --> 01:06:18.958
Lex, hi. Are you alone?

593
01:06:20.083 --> 01:06:23.500
Help us please. Our PT's not here yet.

594
01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.417
-Okay?
-Okay? Let's go.

595
01:06:33.583 --> 01:06:34.792
Okay.

596
01:06:37.417 --> 01:06:39.250
Okay, try again.

597
01:06:56.042 --> 01:06:58.458
Eat that!

598
01:06:59.583 --> 01:07:01.625
-Pull him out!
-Come on!

599
01:07:07.083 --> 01:07:10.708
-What are you doing?
-Just shut up.

600
01:07:11.458 --> 01:07:13.000
Eat that.

601
01:07:14.375 --> 01:07:17.793
It's just that! We'll see...

602
01:07:17.833 --> 01:07:21.125
if the girls still want to be with you
after seeing this video.

603
01:07:23.292 --> 01:07:24.960
Mercy me!

604
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.993
We have a little surprise for you!
Please enjoy this!

605
01:07:30.033 --> 01:07:32.450
No! Don't!

606
01:07:34.583 --> 01:07:36.542
Don't move!

607
01:07:51.875 --> 01:07:54.208
-Mercy me!
-How does it feel?

608
01:07:55.792 --> 01:08:00.418
I don't flirt with them!

609
01:08:00.458 --> 01:08:03.291
-I don't flirt with them!
-Shut up!

610
01:08:03.917 --> 01:08:08.252
-I don't flirt with them!
-Shut up!

611
01:08:08.292 --> 01:08:10.875
Speak clearly!

612
01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:13.001
I don't flirt with them!

613
01:08:13.041 --> 01:08:16.877
They come to me because they think
I know you guys.

614
01:08:16.917 --> 01:08:20.752
-What do you mean?
-What do you mean?

615
01:08:20.792 --> 01:08:23.960
Sara and Amara ask you guys
to go tonight.

616
01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.210
I can give you the adrress.

617
01:08:26.250 --> 01:08:29.958
-But, please stop this!
-Speak clearly!

618
01:08:31.167 --> 01:08:33.167
-Hey!
-Turn that off!

619
01:08:50.792 --> 01:08:52.792
I'm going to kill...

620
01:09:01.667 --> 01:09:05.625
But, why he never bother
and hurt Nio, Mom?

621
01:09:08.073 --> 01:09:12.833
This book gives explanation
about Alex's journey.

622
01:09:13.363 --> 01:09:15.963
It's like he wrote a diary...

623
01:09:16.417 --> 01:09:19.125
from the perspective
of four different girls.

624
01:09:20.333 --> 01:09:22.563
When Alex was Airin,...

625
01:09:22.603 --> 01:09:25.143
he creates your character as a geeky,...

626
01:09:25.583 --> 01:09:26.958
kind...

627
01:09:27.813 --> 01:09:29.813
and her place to share stories.

628
01:09:31.173 --> 01:09:32.131
Geeky?

629
01:09:33.523 --> 01:09:35.433
Be thankful you are considered geeky,...

630
01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.583
so he didn't think of you
as a threat for him.

631
01:09:39.413 --> 01:09:44.223
If not you will end up
just like your friends at the gym.

632
01:09:53.917 --> 01:09:56.708
Everyone who threat and hurt him...

633
01:09:57.125 --> 01:09:59.292
become a target that he would kill!

634
01:10:00.143 --> 01:10:01.310
Sara?

635
01:10:07.943 --> 01:10:08.901
Sara?

636
01:10:13.673 --> 01:10:14.673
Sara?

637
01:10:22.053 --> 01:10:24.423
Sara, this is Rayhan from the gym!

638
01:10:27.958 --> 01:10:30.042
You said that you invited me here?

639
01:10:32.042 --> 01:10:33.125
Sara?

640
01:10:35.458 --> 01:10:36.333
Sara?

641
01:11:07.453 --> 01:11:08.993
Hey, faggot!

642
01:11:11.417 --> 01:11:14.625
What do you want? Do you want more, huh?

643
01:11:18.875 --> 01:11:21.083
What is it? Hey!

644
01:11:54.458 --> 01:11:55.583
But, Mom...

645
01:11:56.042 --> 01:11:57.500
Nio still don't understand this.

646
01:11:58.750 --> 01:12:01.708
Why does he want to rid
those three other personalities?

647
01:12:02.125 --> 01:12:05.627
And why those other three personalities
that he created,...

648
01:12:05.667 --> 01:12:07.000
all of it, is girls?

649
01:12:07.803 --> 01:12:12.127
Because Alex felt
he had the biggest mistake in him.

650
01:12:12.167 --> 01:12:15.917
He blames himself as a weak person.

651
01:12:17.292 --> 01:12:21.917
And Alex identify that weakness
with woman.

652
01:12:22.667 --> 01:12:26.167
He felt unworthy to be born as a man.

653
01:12:26.583 --> 01:12:30.833
And the first personality that emerged
was Sara.

654
01:12:31.417 --> 01:12:38.835
The most mysterious, calm and ruler
of all three other pesonalities.

655
01:12:38.875 --> 01:12:42.513
Until Sara's personality...

656
01:12:42.553 --> 01:12:47.103
take over and get rid
the other three personalities.

657
01:12:56.042 --> 01:13:00.668
They have bigger weakness...

658
01:13:00.708 --> 01:13:03.000
and threatening Alex.

659
01:13:03.792 --> 01:13:05.167
Because the three of them...

660
01:13:06.093 --> 01:13:08.393
are dominated by Sara cruelty.

661
01:13:16.125 --> 01:13:17.167
Marina.

662
01:13:18.833 --> 01:13:21.273
Oh, you are here.

663
01:13:22.750 --> 01:13:23.875
Come in.

664
01:13:26.363 --> 01:13:29.627
All of you must have read the minutes...

665
01:13:29.667 --> 01:13:33.000
that was sent by the police
to your e-mail.

666
01:13:33.708 --> 01:13:35.438
As you know,...

667
01:13:36.333 --> 01:13:40.793
you are the characters
in the imagination...

668
01:13:40.833 --> 01:13:43.278
one of my patients, Alex,...

669
01:13:43.938 --> 01:13:46.188
who has multiple personalities disorder.

670
01:13:48.558 --> 01:13:49.718
You two...

671
01:13:50.908 --> 01:13:54.798
knew Alex at the gym with my son, Nioda.

672
01:13:56.875 --> 01:13:57.917
You...

673
01:13:58.958 --> 01:14:01.960
are a model that Alex adore very much.

674
01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.333
But, you never know Alex, right?

675
01:14:09.288 --> 01:14:10.747
And Miss Airin...

676
01:14:11.918 --> 01:14:14.218
Miss Airin is
an elementary school teacher...

677
01:14:14.917 --> 01:14:17.917
where Alex went to school.

678
01:14:19.408 --> 01:14:25.128
Miss Airin once made notes
about the scars suffered by Alex

679
01:14:25.688 --> 01:14:27.128
And then reported them!

680
01:14:27.908 --> 01:14:29.128
Until...

681
01:14:30.292 --> 01:14:33.375
Alex's mother forbid her child
to go to school.

682
01:14:36.388 --> 01:14:38.298
How's his condition now, Ma'am?

683
01:14:38.818 --> 01:14:41.118
Does Alex have a chance to recover?

684
01:14:42.458 --> 01:14:44.042
It's too early...

685
01:14:44.988 --> 01:14:46.898
to conclude everything, Maám.

686
01:14:47.958 --> 01:14:49.876
Because right now, Alex...

687
01:14:49.916 --> 01:14:52.968
is still in a treatment
and observation stage...

688
01:14:53.008 --> 01:14:55.178
just like court's decision.

689
01:14:59.758 --> 01:15:01.868
From this Alex's diary...

690
01:15:02.958 --> 01:15:06.833
I can trace your whereabouts.

691
01:15:08.292 --> 01:15:10.048
And as I thought,...

692
01:15:11.625 --> 01:15:15.667
it turns out you guys really do exist
in the real world.

693
01:15:18.708 --> 01:15:21.628
Luckily, the police acted quickly.

694
01:15:22.288 --> 01:15:24.808
Otherwise, it's not impossible...

695
01:15:25.998 --> 01:15:28.328
that Alex will kill all of you.

696
01:15:31.667 --> 01:15:33.708
His suffering must have been so great...

697
01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:37.375
that it made Alex the way he is today.

698
01:15:38.318 --> 01:15:39.118
Well...

699
01:15:40.738 --> 01:15:43.188
We must also try to prevent...

700
01:15:44.638 --> 01:15:47.208
the events that happened in Alex...

701
01:15:48.668 --> 01:15:50.218
from happening again.

702
01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:52.518
By trying...

703
01:15:53.398 --> 01:15:58.298
to prevent violence and child abuse.

704
01:16:00.792 --> 01:16:02.125
And I don't know...

705
01:16:03.248 --> 01:16:05.698
if Alex can recover or not.

706
01:16:06.833 --> 01:16:08.292
Because right now,...

707
01:16:09.917 --> 01:16:11.667
Alex is still trapped...

708
01:16:12.208 --> 01:16:14.158
in one of his personalities.

709
01:16:14.778 --> 01:16:19.678
You mean, for Alex he is Sara?

710
01:16:21.508 --> 01:16:26.188
Only Alex knows, Nio.
That is in his imagination.

711
01:16:28.083 --> 01:16:31.678
New characters may probably emerge.

712
01:16:33.228 --> 01:16:38.498
Or it could be those three
other personalities...

713
01:16:39.048 --> 01:16:40.673
don't really die,...

714
01:16:41.948 --> 01:16:46.148
until he could find a new victim.

715
01:16:47.708 --> 01:16:51.083
Sara, please stop it! It's noisy!

716
01:16:52.792 --> 01:16:54.708
I would rather listening
to Sara play the cello...

717
01:16:55.215 --> 01:16:57.011
instead of listening
to your silliness, Rach!

718
01:16:57.542 --> 01:16:59.335
How dare you, bitch!

719
01:16:59.375 --> 01:17:02.333
Guys, come on!

720
01:17:02.848 --> 01:17:04.557
Just enjoy it!

721
01:17:06.458 --> 01:17:08.917
We will be together forever, right?
